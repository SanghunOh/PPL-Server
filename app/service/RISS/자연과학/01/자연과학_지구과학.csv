In return, oceans have experienced significant declines in seawater pH and the aragonite saturation state also called ocean acidification. This study evaluates the distribution of aragonite saturation state, an indicator to assess the potential threat from ocean acidification, by combining newly obtained data from the west coast of South Korea with previous datasets covering the Yellow Sea, East Sea, northern South China Sea, and southeast coast of South Korea. In general, offshore waters absorb atmospheric CO2; however, most of the collected water samples show aragonite oversaturation. On the southeast coast, the aragonite saturation state was significantly affected by river discharge and associated variables, such as freshwater input with nutrients, seasonal stratification, biological carbon fixation, and bacterial remineralization. In summer, hypoxia and mixing with relatively acidic freshwater made the Jinhae and Gwangyang Bays undersaturated with respect to aragonite, possibly threatening marine organisms with CaCO3 shells. However, widespread aragonite undersaturation was not observed on the west coast, which receives considerable river water discharge. In addition, occasional upwelling events may have worsened the ocean acidification in the southwestern part of the East Sea.
These results highlight the importance of investigating site-specific ocean acidification processes in coastal waters. Along with the above-mentioned seasonal factors, the dissolution of atmospheric CO2 and the deposition of atmospheric acidic substances will continue to reduce the aragonite saturation state in Korean waters. To protect marine ecosystems and resources, an ocean acidification monitoring program should be established for Korean waters.",김태욱,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102406641
"열수지 자료 해석에서 드러난 중학생의 복사 평형, 온실 효과, 지구 온난화에 대한 이해","This study aimed to determine whether middle school students could understand global warming and the greenhouse effect, and explain them in terms of global radiative equilibrium. From July 13 to July 24 in 2021, 118 students in the third grade of middle school, who completed a class module on ‘atmosphere and weather’, participated in an online assessment consisting of multiple-choice and written answers on radiative equilibrium, the greenhouse effect, and global warming; 97 complete responses were obtained. After analysis, it was found that over half the students (61.9%) correctly described the meaning of radiative equilibrium; however, their explanations frequently contained prior knowledge or specific examples outside of the presented data. The majority of the students (92.8%) knew that the greenhouse effect occurs within Earth’s atmosphere, but many (32.0%) thought of the greenhouse effect as a state in which the radiative equilibrium is broken. Less than half the students (47.4%) answered correctly that radiative equilibrium occurs on both Earth and the Moon. Most of the students (69.1%) understood that atmospheric re-radiation is the cause of the greenhouse effect, but few (39.2%) answered correctly that the amount of surface radiation emitted is greater than the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth’s surface. In addition, about half the students (49.5%) had a good understanding of the relationship between the increase in greenhouse gases and the absorption of atmospheric gases, and the resulting reradiation to the surface. However, when asked about greenhouse gases increases, their thoughts on surface emissions were very diverse; 14.4% said they increased, 9.3% said there was no change, 7.2% said they decreased, and 18.6% gave no response. Radiation equilibrium, the greenhouse effect, and global warming are a large semantic network connected by the balance and interaction of the Earth system. This can thus serve as a conceptual system for students to understand, apply, and interpret climate change caused by global warming. Therefore, with the current climate change crisis facing mankind, sophisticated program development and classroom experiences should be provided to encourage students to think scientifically and establish scientific concepts based on accurate understanding, with follow-up studies conducted to observe the effects.",정수임,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108052930

제주도 하논 화산분화구의 지질유산 가치와 활용방안,"The Hanon volcano is one of the outstanding geoheritages representing the late stage of volcanic activity in Jeju Island, Korea. Its volcanic topography and strata have a world- to national-class geological value for following three reasons. First, Hanon is only one hydrovolcano possessing maar-type crater in Korea, which assigns a national significance in volcanic topographic field. Second, the unique maar-type crater of Hanon volcano improves the diversity of geoheritage in Jeju volcanic islands expending a spectrum of the hydrovolcano from tuff cone and ring to maar. Finally, the crater-lake deposit in Hanon has a world-class geological value, providing various paleoenvironmental proxies to studies on paleoecosystem and paleoclimate changes in East Asia region as well as Jeju Island. In spite of these invaluable geological significances of Hanon, the anthropogenic modification and destruction of topography and ecosystem have continued until very recently. For an improvement of geoheritage value of Hanon and its sustainable utilization, it is necessary to make elaborate plans for restoration and land usage, differentiating the crater and its surrounding areas into conservation, eco-friendly utilization and development zones depending on geological significance and integrity of individual areas. The Hanon geoheritage can be utilized as a place of environmental education, geo- and eco-tourism, culture-historical tourism, and ecological park for local resident. Furthermore, designation of a complex heritage area (i.e. geo-cluster) including Hanon and its neighboring geoheritage sites and tourism infrastructures will help local communities maximize the sustainable utilization and social-economic development.",윤석훈,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100535271

‘우주 위험’ 관련 뉴스 기사의 텍스트 마이닝 분석 연구,"This study aimed to confirm the status of media reports on space hazards using topic modeling analysis of media articles that are related to space hazards for the past 12 years. Therefore, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis was performed by collecting over 1200 space hazards articles between 2010 and 2021 on solar storm, artificial space objects, and natural space objects from BIGKins news platform. The articles related to solar storm focused on three topics: the effect of solar explosion on satellites; effect of solar explosion on radio communication in Korea, centered on the Korean Space Weather Center; and relationship between aircrew and space radiation. The articles related to artificial space objects focused on three topics: the threat of space garbage to satellite and space stations and the transition of useful objects into space junk; the relationship between space garbage and humanity as shown in movies; and the effort of developed countries for tracking, monitoring, and disposing of space garbage. The articles related to natural space objects focused on two topics: International Space Agency’s tracking and monitoring of near-Earth asteroids and the countermeasures of collisions, and the evolution and extinction of dinosaurs and mammals, with a focus on the collisions of asteroids or comets. Therefore, this study confirmed that domestic media play a role in conveying dangers of space hazards and arousing the attention of public using a total of eight themes in various fields such as society and culture, and derived education method and policy on space hazards",조훈,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107952031

태양 복사와 가시광선 복사 및 지구 복사와 적외선 복사의 관계에 대한 고등학생들의 인식,"This study began with the hypothesis of whether “solar radiation” and “terrestrial radiation” can be replaced by “visible radiation” and “infrared radiation”, respectively. To this end, we investigated the perceptions of high school students who completed the Earth Science I course through a questionnaire to reveal how they perceived each concept.
We also analyzed the descriptions and illustrations of textbooks that may have affected their perceptions. All of the students who participated in the questionnaire recognized solar radiation as radiation emitted only in the visible light region. About 35% of the students recognized convection, conduction, and latent heat as energy transfer by radiation in the Earth’s heat budget. By analyzing six types of Earth Science I textbooks in the 2015 revised curriculum, we observed that two types introduced the terms “shortwave radiation” and “longwave radiation” but had no explanation for them, while the other two described solar radiation as “radiation mainly in the visible light region” or “radiation in short wavelengths”. Regarding solar and terrestrial radiation in the last two types, there was no explanation for the wavelength regions, or ambiguous terms such as “short wavelength” and “long wavelength” were used. In addition, the two textbooks contained some errors in the illustration of the energy budget. Considering that textbooks described solar and terrestrial radiation without defining the exact terms for shortwave and longwave radiation, learners are likely to recognize solar and terrestrial radiation as visible and infrared radiation, respectively. This finding implies that vague statements or errors in textbooks can cause or reproduce students’ misconceptions. The discussion in this study is expected to be used as a helpful reference material for teaching and learning processes regarding the Earth's radiation equilibrium and heat budget, and thereby contribute to proposing reasonable description plans for future textbook writing",이종진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108614225

운산 금 광상에서 산출되는 함 텅스텐 금홍석의 산상과 화학조성,"The Unsang gold deposit has been one of the three largest deposits (Daeyudong and Kwangyang) in Korea. The deposit consists of Au-bearing quartz veins filling fractures along fault zones in Precambrian metasedimentary rock and Jurassic Porphyritic granite, which suggests that it might be anorogenic-type. Based on its mineral assemblages and quartz textures, quartz veins are classified into 1)galena-quartz, 2)pyrrhotite-quartz, 3)pyrite-quartz, 4)pegmatic quartz, 5)muscovite-quartz, and 6)simple quartz vein types. The pyrite-quartz vein type we studied shows the following alteration features: sericitization, chloritization, and silicification. The quartz vein contains minerals including white quartz, white mica, chlorite, pyrite, rutile, calcite, monazite, zircon, and apatite. Rutile with euhedral or medium aggregate occur at mafic part from laminated quartz vein. Two types of rutile are distinguishable in BSE image, light rutile is texturally later than dark rutile. Chemical composition of rutile has 89.69∼98.71wt.% (TiO2), 0.25∼7.04 wt.% (WO3), 0.30∼2.56 wt.% (FeO), 0.00∼1.71 wt.% (Nb2O5), 0.17∼0.35 wt.% (HfO2), 0.00∼0.30 wt.% (V2O3), 0.00∼0.35 wt.% (Cr2O3) and 0.04∼0.25 wt.% (Al2O3), and light rutile are higher WO3, Nb2O5 and FeO compared to the dark rutile. It indicates that dark rutile and light rutile were formed at different stage. The substitution mechanisms of dark rutile and light rutile are suggested as followed : dark rutile [(V3+, Cr3+) + (Nb5+, Sb5+) ←→ 2Ti4+, 4Cr3+ (or 2W6+) ←→ 3Ti4+ (W6+ ←→2Cr3+), V4+ ←→ Ti4+], light rutile [2Fe3+ + W6+ ←→ 3Ti4+, 3Fe2+ + W6+ ←→ Ti4+ + (V3+, Al3+, Cr3+)+Nb5+], respectively. While the dark rutile was formed by cations including V3+, V4+, Cr3+, Nb5+, Sb5+ and W6+ by regional metamorphism of hostrock, the postdating light rutile was formed by redistribution of cations from predating dark rutile and addition of Fe2+ and W6+ from Au-bearing hydrothermal fluid during ductile shear.",유봉철,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107020201
돼지풀잎벌레의 섭식에 의한 생태계교란 식물인 단풍잎돼지풀의 제어 가능성 연구,"To develop an effective management plan for Ambrosia trifida L., an invasive alien plant in Korea, we assessed the potential of Ophraella communa LeSage as a biological control agent. This involved investigating the host specificity of the herbivore Ophraella communa LeSage, its annual travel distance, and the impact of this insect on the fitness of Ambrosia trifida L. We confirmed the host plant preference of Ophraella communa LeSage.
The travel distance of this insect was determined by monitoring its appearance in selected Ambrosia trifida L.
communities without these insects at distances of 10, 20, 30, and 100 meters, based on the locations where the presence of Ophraella communa LeSage was observed. The growth, reproductive, and physiological responses of Ambrosia trifida L. were measured according to feeding by Ophraella communa LeSage. As a result, Ophraella communa LeSage fed on only three taxa and moved short distances within a radius of 30 m per year from the host. The feeding behavior of the herbivore had a negative impact on the growth, reproductive, and physiological responses of Ambrosia trifida L. And the plant's growth and reproduction improved with increasing distance from the herbivore. Furthermore, the introduction of herbivores was able to control over 90% of Ambrosia trifida L. when the coverage of the Ambrosia trifida L. group was below 50%. However, the effectiveness of the removal decreased when the coverage exceeded 90%. These results are likely to be utilized by Ophraella communa LeSage as an ecological control agent.

기후는 이산화탄소 증가에 얼마나 민감한가?,"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the corresponding national low-carbon policy should be grounded on the scientific understanding of climate sensitivity to the increase in CO2 concentration. This is, however, precluded by the fact that current estimates of the climate sensitivity highly vary. To understand the scientific background, limitations, and prospects of the climate sensitivity study, this paper reviews, as objectively as possible, the most recent results on the sensitivity issue. Theoretically, the climate sensitivity hinges on climate feedbacks from various atmospheric and surface physical processes. Especially cloud and sea-ice processes associated with shortwave radiation are known to have largest uncertainty, resulting in an inaccurate estimation of climate sensitivity. For this reason, recent observational studies using satellite data suggest sensitivity lower than or similar to those estimated by climate models (2-5 K per doubled CO2).",최용상,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101788456

This study attempts to identify the sedimentary environment of the Baeguiri Formation by investigating the exposures overlain by basalt. Five sites, including Gomunri (G), Eundaeri (E), Jangjingyo (J), Baeguigyo (B), and Hantangang Dam (HD), were selected. Various types of sedimentary layers were observed, including a layer composed of clay and fine-coarse grain sand, in addition to layers composed of gravel in the Baeguiri Formation. These layers are proposed to have been formed by slumping, the formation of sedimentary dunes by the slumping, and the change in the shape of the channel. Most of the gravels were comparable with bedrock within 20km, and the sedimentary environment of the Baeguiri Formation could be interpreted as a fluvial environment by synthesizing the survey results of each site.",유지희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105588113
