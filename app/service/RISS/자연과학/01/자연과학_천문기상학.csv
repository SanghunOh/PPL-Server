This study examines possible future changes in the costal tourist destinations of South Korea, focusing on changes in preferred weather conditions for beach activities and the expansion of flooding beaches due to sea level rise. The results show that days available for beach activities will be increased, but weather comfort for activity will be decreased. When it comes to the effects of sea level rise, beaches at the South Sea have high flooding potential, while beaches at the East Sea have low flooding probability. These findings suggest the need for location-specific adaption strategies to minimize climate change impacts.",김태린,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99806186
"RCP, SSP 기후변화 시나리오를 활용한 우리나라 미래 수종 분포 예측 연구","The seriousness of climate change is being discussed in various fields, including the importance of efficient afforestation and forest management as a major carbon absorption sink to help achieve the 2050 carbon neutral aim. The scheme of climate change data has been changed from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) to Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) to reflect socioeconomic land use. The SSP can be used to predict the distribution of future tree species when used with the existing Hydrological and Thermal Analogy Groups (HyTAG) model. Therefore, this study predicted potential distribution changes by tree species using RCP and SSP scenario data and compared the trends of the two scenarios to actual climate change data. For the analysis, climatic indices were constructed by period and used in the HyTAG model to predict potential distribution of tree species. Growth of needleleaf and broadleaf trees was confirmed only in the vicinity of the alpine region of Gangwon-do, with decreasing proportions of 81% (RCP 8.5) and 97% (SSP 5-8.5) in the RCP and SSP scenarios, respectively. In addition, the area of such trees decreased by 50% in the long-term (2051-2080) compared to the mid-term (2021-2050) and was nearly depleted in severe cases. Comparison of hydrological and thermal indices by climate change scenario confirmed that actual climate change was progressing faster than predicted in any climate change scenarios. These results show that forests, which are major carbon absorption sinks, are facing serious risks from rapid climate change and should be considered in decision-making on climate change adaptation measures and future afforestation strategies.",김찬우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102073684
기후변화시대 원자력에 대한 가이아론과 러브록의 한계,"Nuclear industry has been considered as a fading industry after the nuclear accident of Chernobyl. But now the catch phrase of ‘nuclear renaissance’ is publicly used. The argument supporting nuclear energy appears even in Europe. It is the radical climate changes that brought about this argument. Some people say that nuclear energy is the only alternative that does not emit green house gases. A British scientist, James Lovelock, is the central figure that supports these theoretical arguments. He is considered as one of the famous environmentalists in the world. He conceptualized the theory of Gaia. It is hard to understand why a famous environmentalist would support nuclear energy, especially in Korea where environmentalists support anti-nuclear movements. So this paper relates the logical fallacy of nuclear supporting group at the inherent limit of Gaia theory as anti-humanist, and the limit of technological determinism. In conclusion, it suggests that we need to discuss about nuclear energy as a measure of climate change. It is especially important in Korea because there is no open discussion about nuclear research and it’s applications.",진상현(Jin Sang hyun),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107947072
대체단백질식품의 시장점유 시나리오별 축산부문 온실가스 배출량 추정,"The livestock sector, producing 14.5 percent of anthropocentric GHG emissions, plays an important role in climate change (Gerber et al., 2013). In this study, GHG emissions of the livestock sector due to dietary changes caused by alternative protein food (alternative meat) were compared with the GHG reduction target in Korea. Assuming a scenario in which substitute meat occupies 28% of the domestic livestock market in 2030, 0.56 million tons of livestock production was replaced. In this case, GHG in the livestock sector decreased by 3.6 million tonnes CO2eq compared to BAU (Business As Usual) GHG emissions. This is equivalent to 38.7% of the total reduction target (9.3 million tons) of the livestock industry by 2050. Although this study is useful for predicting the impact of changes in Korean diets, it has limitations in that it does not consider the interactions between the development of livestock technology and variables of market change. If factors such as changes in the types of livestock products, changes in the livestock self-sufficiency rate, and development of emission factors according to productivity improvement are considered, more accurate emission calculations will be possible.",최윤실,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101817276
생태계 부문의 기후변화 적응 갭 분석,"As increasing the damage caused by climate change and attention of the people, the appearing of the terms ‘adaptation gap’, ‘adaptation goals’ are increasing. However, there are no clear definitions of these terms. This study defined climate change adaptation gap as the difference between the adaptation goals and adaptation effort, set quantitative adaptation goals and analyzed climate change adaptation gap. By analyzing the climate change adaptation gap, it can be evaluated the effectiveness of climate change adaptation plans and directed the future national climate change adaptation plan. This study’s methodology is selecting the index based on National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (NAP) Risk, assessment of data availability, setting quantitative adaptation goals, driving the climate change adaptation gap and proposing the way to improve climate change adaptation plan in the future. At this time, expert discussion was conducted to select the additional index and review national climate change adaptation action plan. The important purpose of the study is to analyze the climate change adaptation gap by setting the quantitative adaptation goals. Following this study’s methodology, intent to set up the quantitative adaptation goals, analyze the adaptation gap and contribute to the establishment of national climate change adaptation plan in the future.",김미래,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107426224
기후변화대응 국제개발협력 활성화를 위한 민간참여 유도 방안,"Climate change affects every region globally, but developing countries are often more severely affected due to insufficient capacity to respond to climate change, and support for these nations is urgently needed. Developed countries make efforts to expanding international development cooperation through official development assistance (ODA), but limitations exist in increasing the budget for international cooperation. Therefore, it is necessary to encourage the participation of the private sector in international cooperation. The goal of this study is to find ways to engage with the private sector for international cooperation. To that end, experts in the field of international cooperation were surveyed. The Delphi method was used to gather various opinions from experts. Results showed that the first priority to engage the private sector was ‘The financial support of the government for private sector participation in international development cooperation’. Ways to provide financial support included reducing corporate tax, providing subsidies, and allowing loans for private enterprises participating in international cooperation, among others. The second priority was ‘Providing consulting to private enterprises inexperienced in international cooperation’. The third priority was ‘Expanding public-private partnership’. The results presented in this study can be used as basic data for establishing policies and strategies for international development cooperation in developing countries.",박선경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102140797
파리협정과 한국 기후변화 적응정책의 정합성 분석,"The study aims to evaluate the extent to which South Korean climate change adaptation policies are consistent with the global rules on adaptation under the Paris Agreement. We established indicators of policy goal coherence based on Morgan et al.(2019). According to the research results, South Korea’s 3rd National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (3rd NAP) adequately aligns with the adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement. The detailed goals and projects outlined in the 3rd NAP contain all eight policy options based on the core concept of adaptation to the Paris Agreement and combine diverse options to consider policy characteristics. Drawing on the findings, the policy implications are as follows. First, to maximize goal coherence in the process of establishing climate change adaptation policy, systematic and agreed upon coordination measures between government agencies and departments should precede. Moreover, adaptation policies should be established based on sensitively identifying key concepts of international norms that change over time to improve policy goal coherence between international regimes and domestic policy. It is necessary to make continuous efforts to increase the coherence between domestic adaptation policies and the adaptation goals of the Paris Agreement, considering detailed policy options in a balanced way.",한진희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107212670
토픽 모델링 분석을 활용한 국내 기후변화 연구동향 분석 : IPCC 실무그룹별 주요 키워드를 중심으로,"Due to the considerable global damage caused by abnormal weather patterns resulting from climate change, there has been an increasing interest in climate change response both domestically and internationally. To address this issue, the WMO (World Meteorological Organization) and UNEP (The United Nations Environment Programme) established the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in 1988 to provide scientific evidence on climate change phenomena, their impacts, and future risks. To date, six assessment reports have been published. This study analyzed domestic research trends related to the major themes of the working groups classified by the IPCC (Working Group Ⅰ: The Physical Science Basis, Working Group Ⅱ: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, Working Group Ⅲ: Mitigation of Climate Change, and TFI: The Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories). Analysis revealed that the key topics covered in the recently published IPCC AR6 Working Group reports are also being actively studied in domestic academic research in Korea. Additionally, the distinctiveness of research topics that are being emphasized in Korea, such as “Corporate Social Responsibility in Environmental Management” and “Emissions Trading System and Carbon Tax” in Working Group III, was identified. In conclusion, this study identified trends in domestic climate change-related research and provided suggestions that can contribute to directions of future research by comparing the main research topics covered by IPCC and those in Korea.",유재호,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107945907
기후위기 담론에서 인문학의 위상과 인문정책 방안,"The humanities have been one of the most marginalized disciplines in climate crisis discourse. The humanities have often been excluded from the policy process, including international agreements, planning, and implementation. The climate change field has promoted interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary studies, but they mostly involved social science, natural science, and engineering; the humanities were generally not considered. Neither has humanities research been well-represented for its essential, unique role in climate change discourse; therefore, expansion of academic activities and participation in discussion of the humanities are necessary. In this regard, the purpose of this essay is twofold. First, it scrutinizes the weakness of the current status of the humanities in climate change discourse. Second, it proposes ways to promote participation of the humanities. In particular, it first proposes establishment of a new interdisciplinary field called ""climate humanities” based on existing national research funds and projects and recommends curriculum change. There is currently very little teaching about the climate crisis from a humanities perspective. Including such materials in primary, secondary, and even higher education curricula will increase the significance of climate humanities and cultivate humanistic sensibility in future generations.",임철희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102073683
이상기후에 대한 농업인의 인식 실태 분석,"This study aims to analyze farmer's perceptions of extreme climate events. To achieve the research objective, a farm survey was conducted on farmers, and the Multinomial Logit Model was used for analysis. The analysis showed that 48.2% of farmers who received extreme climate information said they were using the information for farming. Only 35.7% of farmers who had received extreme climate information said they were provided with technologies in response to extreme climate events. Furthermore, only 17.5% of farmers have received education related to extreme climate events. The empirical analysis found that the greater was a farmer’s understanding of climate events, the more likely they are to choose crop insurance in response to such events. Precise and user-friendly information on extreme climate events, R&D and dissemination of response technologies, and provision of education are useful for farmers to respond properly to extreme climate events.",정학균,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105974769
기후변화 · 지속가능발전 · 코로나 펜데믹 대응 정책통합 분석 연구 : 유엔기후변화협약 하의 개도국 지원 메커니즘을 중심으로,"Since the year 2020, we have faced global challenges including the COVID-19 pandemic and the threat of climate change alongside sustainable development. Numerous policies have been designed and implemented in the context of tackling ongoing challenges.
Developed countries have responded through individual policies for each challenge as well as policy packages. However, developing countries have faced more difficulties in responding to each of those challenges. Within the given context, United Nations-based policies focus on the relevance between or amongst respective policies on climate change, sustainable development, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent studies have shown that even separately undertaken policies are intertwined, overlapping, and sometimes even conflicting, and that there should be an integrative policy approach to avoid overlap and conflict and seek complementarity. Thus, some studies take an integrative approach at the center of sustainable development policies to integrate climate change and COVID-19 pandemic policies. Other studies explore the integration of COVID-19 pandemic response policy with sustainable development and climate policies. Yet, there is a lack of study regarding integrative approaches from climate change policy to sustainable development and COVID-19 policies. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore whether climate policy integrates sustainable development and COVID-19 pandemic policy response. This study explores three mechanisms in the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFCCC) that support developing countries: the Technology Mechanism, the Financial Mechanism, and the Market Mechanism. The analytical approach is grounded in policy integration theory. Analytical results show that all three mechanisms have integrated, though not fully sufficient, their climate policies with the policies to tackle sustainable development and in advance COVID-19 pandemic. This paper concludes with policy implications.",오채운,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107947157
기후불평등의 공간적 평가: 서울시 홍수재해를 대상으로,"With climate change, the risk of climate-related disasters has increased, and the extent of this risk varies depending on social and economic conditions. In South Korea, climate inequality was highlighted through the concentrated heavy rainfall in the central region in August 2022, which resulted in significant casualties and property damage among vulnerable populations. Given the need to consider vulnerable groups who struggle to adapt to anticipated climate crisis situations and to reduce disparities among groups, this study aims to spatially identify flood inequality in Seoul to contribute to tailored policies for the region. The evaluation of inequality includes factors such as extreme precipitation data, socially vulnerable populations, and vulnerable residential areas. It also incorporates greenhouse gas emissions, which are the cause of climate change, to examine the correlation between high greenhouse gas emitting groups and groups with high climate risk. All the information was implemented as spatial data at the administrative district level for spatial analysis. The analysis results revealed a concentration of socially vulnerable populations in the northern region of Seoul. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the residential environment or expand infrastructure for the vulnerable in this and other such areas Flood-prone areas are widely distributed in the south, requiring policies on flood prevention and safety. Overall, the western region of Seoul showed higher inequality. This analysis identified the degree and characteristics of inequality in different regions, highlighting the need for follow-up studies to establish practical policies through integration with climate adaptation strategies.",박지수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103237685
기후변화 시나리오에 근거한 과수 개화기 변화 및 개화 후 저온 발생 전망,"In the spring of 2018, opened-flowers of fruit trees were frozen to death due to abnormal low temperature around Jeonbuk Province and southern Gyeonggi Province areas. In the 2000s, abnormal weather is observed all over the world very frequently. As a consequence, various sectors of the society suffer from economic damage and negative effects of the abnormal weather. Moreover, recent global climate change is believed to increase the incidence of extreme weathers, which are out of the normal range of the local climate. It is necessary to identify these abnormal weather phenomena accurately and analyze the effects of them on crops in order to understand the effects of them on crop yields. This study projected the trend of the low-temperature occurrence in the future by predicting the changes in future flowering dates and quantifying the temperature distribution after flowering using climate change scenarios. This study targeted areas actually producing a major portion of pear, peach, and apple in South Korea. The results of this study predicted that the flowering dates of these fruits will be approximately 20 days earlier than the current normal year in the future (2071-2100) for the study area. Moreover, it was found that the distribution of low temperature would vary by fruit type and region to some degree. The results of this study present only a portion of fruit trees cultivars grown in South Korea. It was expected that, when this approach is applied to various crops and fruit trees, it will be possible to contribute to preparing countermeasures for climate change in the agricultural sector.",김대준,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108573514
