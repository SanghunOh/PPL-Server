We assume that the fermion condensations occur and supersymmetry is broken at the early stage of the universe. Adding dilation mass term to the theory, we find a cosmological solution in which the 4-dimensional space-time relaxes to Minkowski space and the extra 6-dimensions becomes stable after sufficient inflation.",박문호,1990,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19595575
누가 암흑물질을 주문했나?: 암흑물질의 필요성,"Dark matter is a component of matter in the Universe, whose existence is apparent only via gravitational interactions, not via electromagnetic interactions. The amount of dark matter in the energy budget of the Universe is about five times larger than that of the baryonic component in the standard model, but its origin is still not understood. So in this article, we discuss various astrophysical phenomena, virial motion of stars, the flat rotation curve of galaxies, weak gravitational lensing and cosmic microwave background radiation, which clearly show the effects of dark matter and provide theoretical opportunities to explain it.",박성찬,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30049300
전선에서의 발열이 옴의 법칙에 미치는 영향,"In order to investigate the influence of heat generated in electric wires on Ohm's law, we constructed solenoids by winding enamel wires on cylindrical cores made of aluminum and copper, and we observed the variations in the I-V curves with changing temperature caused by the applied current. The result shows that the non-linearity of Ohm's law increased with rising temperature of the coils. A qualitative analysis was realized by using the thermal conductivity and the specifics of the cores and showed that the variation of the resistance caused by the generation of heat in the coils was inversely proportional to the thermal coupling coefficient of the cores and that the non-linearity of Ohm's law was larger for cores with increased thermal coupling coefficients.",추민우,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3020900
코로나 19 상황에서 장시간 마스크 착용이 안구건조증에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: This study investigated the effect of prolonged face mask-wearing on dry eyes and ocular symptoms in adults during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: The online survey responses of 138 adults were analyzed. The survey was conducted for two months from March 2021. The questionnaire included 7 items on general characteristics, 6 items on ocular symptoms related to mask-wearing for the prevention of COVID-19, and 7 mask-associated items. Ocular symptoms, including dry eyes, were described using “no symptoms,” “the same,” or “worse” after mask-wearing. The average daily duration of mask-wearing and wearing behaviors were also investigated. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 66.7% of the subjects wore a mask for an daily average of 5 hours or more. 52.2% of the subjects wore their masks correctly with nose coverage. 21.5% of the subjects reported worsening dry eye symptoms after mask-wearing. There were also reported cases of increased ocular redness and tearing (both 10.7%). During the pandemic, when the mask is not fitted well to the nose, and the mask is worn for more than 5 hours a day, individuals have an 8.24 times higher risk of having dry eye symptoms compared to the group that did not. Conclusions: During the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a mask has become a necessity in daily life, and in the group that wore ill-fitting masks for a prolonged period had a higher risk of associated dry eye symptoms. Preventive strategies against dry eyes and guidelines for ocular health management are urgently needed.",김세진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104339352
일반화된 탄동진자를 통한 선운동량과 각운동량 보존 연구,"We study a perfectly inelastic collision between a moving bullet and a generalized ballistic pendulum consisting of particles. We obtained the general solutions for the linear and the angular velocities of the ballistic pendulum just after the collision. While the angular momentum is always conserved just before and after the collision, the linear momentum is found to be conserved only when the collision occurs at a very specific point. If the bullet collides with the nth particle of the ballistic pendulum, the collision condition satisfying both the linear and the angular momentum conservations is found to be 3n = 2N +1 (n≤ N).
We also proved that the point satisfying this collision condition corresponds to the center of percussion of the generalized ballistic pendulum.",김은경,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60112345

안경 렌즈 및 물체의 색상에 따른 최대 조절력 변화,"Purpose: To determine whether the accommodation of amplitude (AA) was changed by the color of the spectacle lens or object. Methods: AA was measured in forty subjects in their 20s when they viewed different target-on-background color combination with achromatic, gray, brown or green lens. Minus-lens procedures were used for the estimation of AA. Results: When subjects viewed the black-on-white, red-on-white and green-on-white targets, AA under tinted lens tended to be increased compared with AA under achromatic lens. Especially, the green lens significantly increased AA whatever the color of target was. Furthermore, as subjects viewed the green target, AA was the highest irrespective of the color of lens. AA was also changed depending on the color of background, so AA on the red background was lower than on the white background. On the contrary, AA on the green background was higher than on the red or white backgrounds. Of tinted lens, the gray lens increased AA the lowest, but the green lens did the highest. The number of subjects, whose AA were measured more than 9 D, reached to 12.5% with the gray lens, 21.3% with the brown lens, 22.5% with the green lens on the green background, but 5%, 6.5% and 6.5% on the red background, respectively. Conclusions: This results showed that AA varied depending on the color of spectacle lens, objects or background, and the eye fatigue could be decreased with proper color of spectacle lens accordingly.",오병하,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103507812

고성능과 안정성을 갖는 메틸 암모늄이 제거된 할라이드 페로브스카이트 태양전지 연구,"Organic/inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the most promising next-generation energy harvester owing to their high efficiency of 25.7%. However, they are usually vulnerable to humidity, hindering their commercialization. Developing new perovskites without the organic cation methylammonium (MA), which is extremely weak under humidity, is crucial to resolve the low stability. Here, we report efficient and air-stable PSCs based on MA-free perovskite with a combination of rubidium (Rb), cesium (Cs), and formamidinium (FA) cations. The power conversion efficiency of the CsFARb perovskite is 14.5% due to the many surface defects generated during crystal formation. By introducing hydrophobic organic cations on top of the CsFARb perovskite, we successfully enhance the device efficiency by up to 17% with suppressed defects on the surface. In addition, the cations help prevent the infiltration of water molecules into the inner perovskite structures, thereby dramatically improving the device durability in the humid atmosphere.",김정환,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103507828

In addition, based on the history of science related to the photoelectric effect, several textbooks did not include the history of science in the acceptance of the theory of the photoelectric effect. The photoelectric effect principle was primarily explained using the photon model, and the explanation based on the classical viewpoint, that is, the wave theory, was presented only in some textbooks. Moreover, several differences in the definition of photons and the quantum interpretation of experimental results were observed among textbooks.

빅뱅 핵합성에서의 암흑물질의 효과 연구에 대한 고찰,"We present a brief review regarding the effect of dark matter on Big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). Light elements up to $^9$Be, whose abundances has been determined by using astrophysics spectroscopy and analysis of chondrites, are believed to have been produced during the BBN epoch. Therefore, the standard particle model, as well as models beyond the standard cosmological model, most produce results that ard consistent with the abundances of elements produced during BBN. The need for such consistency can be used to put effective constrains on some of the parameters in such models. This paper addresses how dark matter (DM) affects element production and how important parameters of DM can be constrained by using BBN network calculations and observational data. For example, in this paper, the effects on BBN due to some dark-matter candidates, such as X-particles, sterile neutrinos and axions, along with constraints on the parameters from the BBN, are discussed.",장덕재,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104323240
컴퓨터 게임 시 안구운동의 방향에 따른 조절기능의 변화,"Purpose: In this study, the effect of the eye movement direction on visual function related to accommodation was investigated when playing computer games for a certain period of time. Methods: Total 60 subjects in 20s who had the visual acuity of 1.0 or higher without any ocular disease and accommodative dysfunction were asked to play computer games separately in horizontal and vertical directions for 40 and 90 minutes and then measured their accommodative amplitude, accommodative facility, accommodative lag and relative accommodations. The visual function when not doing the computer game was regarded as a control value, and further compared and analyzed. Results: The accommodative amplitude, accommodative facility, accommodative lag and relative accommodations showed the tendency of decrease after the computer game for 40 minutes, and more reduced values of the visual functions were shown when the computer game extended up to 90 minutes except positive relative accommodation. Positive relative accommodation had a tendency to increase slightly after the computer game for 90 minutes. Meanwhile, the change of the visual functions was primarily influenced by the eye movement in horizontal direction rather than by the eye movement in vertical direction during computer game when analyzed by the direction of eye movement. Conclusions: Over all accommodative functions tended to decrease with the extended VDT working time by computer game, and the frequent eye movement in horizontal direction during VDT tasks could be the main cause of eyestrain since the eye movement in horizontal direction rather than vertical direction significantly affected the change of accommodative function.",권기일,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108331022

안압 변동 요인에 관한 연구,"Purpose: To measure and quantify the factors of intraocular pressure (IOP) variation for normal Korean youth. Methods: The IOP of normal youth 805 persons (male: 367, female: 438) were measured as a function of time and quantity for fixation, reclining posture, hard blinking, drinking water, drinking hard liquor, tobacco and coffee by using non-contact tonometer (AT555, Reichert Co.). In the case of fixation, reclining posture and hard blinking, the intraocular pressure of right and left eye were measured for 6 males and 6 females every 10 minutes during 30 minute. In the case of water, liquor, tobacco and coffee, the measurement for 4 or 5 groups (6 persons/group) having similar IOP were done for the IOP variation of right eye. Results: The mean IOP was 15.2 mmHg for males and 15.8 mmHg for females (slightly higher than male's), respectively and the 99% of those were in the range of the normal IOP. The measured IOP was increased by fixation, reclining posture and hard blinking with males and females. The gradient of increasing slope was 0.15/0.13/0.07/0.08, 0.09/0.08/0.08/0.08 and 0.19/0.08/0.26/0.31, respectively. The IOP variation was elevated by drinking water (especially in the case of 1000 ml) and lowered in proportion to the amount of drinking by hard liquor. Cigarette smoking was associated with rise in intra ocular pressure, but was not shown a definite relation. And coffee had virtually no effect. Conclusions: Fixation, reclining posture, hard blinking and Tobacco caused a transient increase in IOP, but alcohol elicited a slight reduction in IOP overall.",김상문,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107957937
Development and Evaluation of Multipurpose Phantom for Delivery Quality Assurance of Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy,"Treatments demanding high accuracy, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), should provide the optimal dose distribution and correct intervention. Otherwise, they may become unsafe and cause adverse effects to patients. Delivery quality assurance (DQA) for treatment verification can be performed considering the absolute dose using an ionization chamber and relative dose using a film. However, a film imposes a long waiting time for measurement and is sensitive to temperature and humidity, development conditions, and noise.
We aim to evaluate the usefulness of a multipurpose phantom for fast and simple IMRT DQA. The multipurpose phantom is made of poly (methyl methacrylate)-based resin. The phantom allows the insertion of a 2D array detector and an ionization chamber. Therefore, the relative and absolute doses can be measured simultaneously.
The IMRT DQA evaluation provided absolute dose of 0.35 ± 1.74% and relative dose of 99.03 ± 0.6 % in 3 mm/3% gamma evaluation for a linear accelerator. In addition, the absolute and relative doses were 1.37 ± 1.05% and 98.7 ± 0.78% in helical tomotherapy, respectively. Therefore, the dose measurements were within acceptable error limits of 3%. The results demonstrate the multipurpose capabilities of the proposed phantom for evaluating dose distribution and absolute dosimetry.",Jae-Uk Jang,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103823836

백내장 노인의 주관적 건강과 삶의 질 인식에 대한 조사,"Purpose: By comparing the subjective health perception and quality of life of older adults on the basis of the presence or absence of cataract, we investigated the effect of cataract on life of older adults over 65 years of age. Methods: Based on the data from the 7th National Health and Nutrition Survey Terms, subjective health perception, EQ-5D (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression), and EQ-5D index values were compared. Results: In the cataractpatient group, the subjective health perception was 3.28±0.96 points and that in the control group was 3.04±0.94 points, indicating that cataract had a negative effect on the subjective health status. EQ-5D, a measure of quality of life, was measured to indicate a low quality of life in the cataract group in terms of mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. On comparing the values of the EQ-5D index, an indicator of the overall quality of life, the overall quality of life of the cataract-patient group and that of the control group was 0.87±0.16 and 0.90±0.14 points, respectively. This indicated an overall lower quality of life in the cataract-patient group. Conclusions: The subjective health perception of the cataract patient group was more negative than that of the control group, and cataract was found to have a significant effect on the subjectivehealth perception of older adults aged 65 years or above and in the evaluation of comprehensive quality of life.",김스미,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108282476

TiOx 입자를 이용하여 제작된 RRAM소자의 광 조사에 따른 전류-전압 특성,"The RRAM device having a vertical structure of an Al-TiO2-ITO substrate was manufactured using TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized using ligand. The insulator of the RRAM device was manufactured by synthesizing Ti precursors containing TiCl4 and solutions such as 2-(Methylamino) pyridine. To identify the characteristics of RRAM according to light irradiation, visible light and ultraviolet wavelength light were exposed to the lower electrode ITO and I-V sweep was performed. For the specimen device used in this experiment, resistance increased in the visible wavelength region and resistance decreased in the ultraviolet wavelength region. Through this, the tendency of resistance switching behavior according to light irradiation was confirmed. In this study, the resistance change characteristics of the device were confirmed by adjusting wavelength, light source power, and illumination time. Because the resistance changes according to each wavelength represents the on-off switching role of the device, the manufactured device could be used for neuromorphic device applications.",정재훈,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103507613
소프트콘택트렌즈 착용과 관리 및 불편증상의 관계 분석,"Purpose: This purpose of this study was to investigate the wearing status of soft contact lenses and the association between contact lens care and discomfort. Methods: A survey was conducted involving 89 college students who wear contact lenses and 154 visitors to the optician's office were surveyed on lens wearing and care. Results: Seventy (21.7%) participants wore a pair of monthly disposable lens, and 79 (24.5%) participants wore the conventional lens, which are disposed every 6 months. In addition, more than 80% of participants wore their lenses for more than 6 h per day. Therefore, the level of contact lens care could greatly affect the wearer’s eye health. While selecting contact lenses, the ‘eye health’ is considered of utmost importance.
However, 50.6% of participants thought that lens care was insufficient. As the knowledge of contact lens care increased, so did the practice of care. However, the level of care is stagnant despite longer periods of use. Moreover, the degree of thorough care as taught was only performed by approximately 10% of the participants even if the wearing period is long. People wearing lenses for a long period were less thorough in care than those wearing lenses for less than 1 year. Symptoms causing discomfort in contact lens wearers are dryness, foreign body sensation, and red eyes. However, knowledge of care alone did not directly correlate with eye health. Therefore, knowledge of care does not seem to affect eye health. Conclusions: Contact lens wearers are aware of ‘eye health’ but lack knowledge of the method of care for their lenses and one in two people wearing them does not perform lens care well. Even if they have worn lenses for a long period, the level of knowledge of the method of care was stagnant, and the lens care was not thorough. The deeper the knowledge of the method of lens care, the better the care. The better the care provided to the lens, the less inconvenient symptoms appear, such as redness and burning. Therefore, contact lens wearers need to be educated on the methods of care and thoroughly implement lens care to maintain eye health and prevent adverse effects of lenses in the face of an increasing number of contact lens wearers.",최경서,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104339348

Methods: The critical micelle concentration of surfactants and the actual concentration ofsurfactants in contact lens care solutions were investigated by employing references published and relatedinformation. Surface tension of contact lens care solutions was measured by surface tension device at 25±1oC,and contact lenses made of lotrafilcon A, comfilcon A and balafilcon A were washed with contact lens caresolutions after the incubation in artificial tears for 14 days and their cleaning efficacy was compared. Results:Among the 22 contact lens care products, 9 products provided the label of the concentration of surfactant, and 7products showed higher concentration of surfactant than the critical micelle concentration reported in references.
As a result of measuring surface tension, the surface tension of lens care products for soft contact lens wasgenerally lower than other care products. When examined the removal effect of protein deposited on lens surface,it was known that the care products having lower surface tension showed higher protein removal efficiency.
Conclusions: The surface tension is low when surfactant concentration in contact lens care solutions is high, andthe removal effect of protein deposited is accordingly increased with the decrease of surface tension.

우세안과 비우세안의 동적시력 비교,"Purpose: The kinetic visual acuity (KVA) of adults in their 20s was measured in the binocular and monocular eyes, and the results were analyzed by classifying them into dominant and non-dominant eyes. Methods: The eyes of 117 men and 103 women were fully corrected by subjective and objective refraction. Kinetic visual acuity was measured using a KVA device (KOWA AS-4A). The dominant eye was measured from a distance using the hole in the card test. Results: The binocular KVA of all subjects was 0.45±0.22, whereas the KVA of the right and left eyes was 0.39±0.21 and 0.35±0.20, respectively; the binocular KVA was significantly higher than the monocular KVA (p<0.001). Men had KVA of 0.48±0.23 in both eyes, 0.41±0.22 in the right eye, and 0.38±0.20 in the left eye, whereas women had 0.42±0.20 in both eyes, 0.35±0.20 in the right eye, and 0.32±0.19 in the left eye. The KVA of the dominant eye was 0.39±0.21 and that of the non-dominant eye was 0.35±0.19, which was statistically significantly different (p=0.040). Among 211 subjects, 123 showed that KVA was better in the dominant eye than in the non-dominant eye. There are 34 cases where the dominant and non-dominant eyes are the same, and 63 cases in which the non-dominant eye was better than the dominant eye. Conclusions: Binocular KVA was better than monocular KVA, and men had better KVA than women. KVA of the dominant eye was significantly higher than that of the non-dominant eye. In addition, the higher KVA of the dominant eye showed about twice as many distributions as binocular.

The OH value was measured by using Penlight and the PD ruler. Results: The PD which had been measured by the PD system and the OC of the glasses revealed 78.1% of differences. 62.5% of the objects were base-in value prescribed glasses; 58.3% were out of permissible error. Only 8 subject showed concurrence between the prescribed glasses and the OH value, and 82.3% of the objects were induced vertical prism of over 1 (prism diopter). Conclusions: In order to improve the vision function of people who wear glasses, it is necessary to advance the accuracy of PD, OH measurement and making glasses as well.",김효진,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108533750
초등학생에서 push-up과 push-away 방법을 이용한 조절력과 폭주 근점의 측정,"Purpose: We measured the amplitude of accommodation using the push-up and push-away tests and near point of convergence (NPC) and investigated the accommodative insufficiency (AI) and convergence insufficiency (CI) in elementary school children of 12~13 years old. Methods: 88 students who aged 12~13 (12.63±0.51) years old with more than 1.0 spectacle best corrected visual acuity were examined using push-up and push-away tests. The break and recovery points of NPC also were measured. Results: Mean amplitudes of accommodations using push-up and push-away tests were 11.52±2.59 D and 10.06±1.97 D, respectively in right eye (P<0.001). Mean break and recovery points in NPC were 8.66±1.99 cm and 10.98±2.06 cm. AI and CI showed 28.75% and 30.00% each. 48.75% was within normal range in both amplitudes of accommodations according to their age expected and convergence. Students having both AI and CI were 7.50%. Conclusions: A high correlation between the push-up test and push-away test was found in elementary school children (r=0.6025; P<0.05). Students having normal amplitude of accommodation by their age expected and normal convergence were 71.25% and 70.00%,respectively.",김효진,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107284186
양극산화 전압과 시간이 다공성 양극산화 알루미나의 기공 형성에 미치는 영향,"We have investigated the effects of the anodizing voltage and time
on pore formation in porous anodic alumina, fabricated in 0.3-M
oxalic acid under a constant voltage by using the conventional
two-step anodization method. The pore formation strongly depended on
the anodizing voltage and time. Hexagonal close-packed arrays of
pores with a constant pore size and interpore distance were obtained
at a voltage of 40 V. The ordered pore arrangement showed a domain
structure, and each domain was separated from the neighboring
domains with different orientations of the pore lattice. The domain
size linearly increased with increasing anodizing time up to 36 h.
After 36 h, the domain size started to decrease. At 36 h, a highly
ordered pore arrangement with an average domain size of $\sim$5
$\mu$m$^2$ was obtained. At 60 h, the average domain size was
$\sim$1.2 $\mu$m$^2$. The decrease can be explained by limited
diffusion of ions at the two interfaces, i.e., the aluminum/alumina
interface and the alumina/electrolyte interface, due to the
relatively long nano-pore length.",최용찬,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108303596
시각기능 개선을 위한 시기능훈련이 시지각에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: This study was to examine how decline of visual function affects visual perception by assessing visual perception after improving visual function through visual training, and observing the change in the cognitive ability of visual perception. Methods: This study analyzes the visual perceptual evaluation (TVPS_R) of 23 children below age 13(8.75±1.66) who have visual abnormalities, and improves visual function after conducting vision training (vision therapy) of the children. Results: Convergence increased from average 3.39±2.52 Δ (prism) to 13.87±6.04 Δ in the measurement of long-distance disparate points, and from average 5.48±3.42 Δ to 18.43±7.58 Δ in the measurement of short-distance disparate points. Short-distance diplopia points increased from 25.87±7.33 cm to 7.48±2.87 cm, and as for accommodative insufficiency, short-distance blur points increased from 19.57±7.16 cm to 7.09±1.88 cm. In the visual perceptual evaluation performed before and after improving visual function, 6 items except visual memory showed statistically significant improvement. By order of significant improvement, response gap was highest with 17.74±16.94(p=0.000) in visual closure, followed by 15.65±17.11(p=0.000) in visual sequential-memory, 13.65±16.63(p=0.001) in visual figure-ground, 12.74± 18.41(p=0.003) in visual form-constancy, 6.48±10.07 (p=0.005) in visual discrimination, and 4.17±9.33(p=0.043) in visual spatial-relationship. In the visual perception quotient that added up these scores, the response gap was 15.22±8.66(p=0.000), showing a more significant result. Conclusions: Vision training enables efficient visual processing and improves visual perceptual ability. It was confirmed that improvement of visual function through visual training not only improves abnormal visual function but also affects visual perception of children such as learning, perception and recognition.",이승욱,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108386724
우주선을 통한 암흑 물질 간접 탐색,"The existence of dark matter has been confirmed by various observations based on gravitational interactions. Now, the widely-accepted compelling paradigm of dark matter is that it consists of massive, non-luminous, stable particles. However, the nature of dark matter still remains one of the fundamental problems that cannot be understood by using the standard model. Currently, precision cosmic-ray detection experiments are very actively being pursued due to the development of detection technology. Thus, high-energy cosmic-ray measurements will lead research in the field of particle physics in the 21st century. Moreover, products of dark matter annihilation or decay in our Galaxy and beyond will very likely be detected. In this article, we briefly review the current status of cosmic-ray detection experiments and discuss the relation between cosmic-ray signals from dark matter annihilation and cosmic-ray measurements.",박종철,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107919722
Hyaluronic acid 함유 콘택트렌즈의 습윤성과 착용감향상 효과 연구,"Purpose: To study the effect of hyaluronic acid(HA), which was widely used in artificial tears, multi-purpose solution(MPS), cosmetics, and drug acting on the musculo-skeletal system, in wettability and comfort of contact lens, we compared HA including lens(+HA) with HA excluding lens(-HA) by clinical evaluation. Methods: During four weeks, the selected 28 university student volunteers who did not have any eye disease wore +HA contact lens on their right eyes, and -HA contact lens on their left eyes, and then compared right eyes to left eyes as control. After prescribing by spherical equivalent calculation, over-refraction by auto-refractometer, and contact lens wearing for two weeks and four weeks, tear evaluation, the anterior of eyes examination, fitting convenience evaluation, surface wetting test, surveys were checked up. Results: Compared with the control group (-HA contact lens), +HA contact lens provided better wetting properties. The amount of released tear in -HA contact lens group became less in four weeks than before, but that in +HA contact lens group showed no significant difference from the initial one. In terms of the redness in eye, there was no significant difference between +HA and -HA contact lens groups. Fitting of +HA contact lens on eye was much easier than the control, -HA contact lens. From the results of survey, comfort, wettability, ease of cleaning, and dryness of eye in +HA contact lens group were generally better than those of -HA group, but redness and contact lens handling showed little difference. Conclusions: The addition of HA in soft contact lens(+HA) may enhance the wettability of lens during lens wearing, resulted in the better comfortable wearing of lens eventually.",김현정,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108767227
건성안 검사 방법의 신뢰도에 대한 연구,"Purpose: To study on the confidence of dry eye diagnosis methods which need to prescribe contact lens. Methods: Non-invasive tear film break-up time (NIBUT) and tear film break-up time (TBUT) were measured in forty healthy subjects in their 20s, and then the subjects were classified into normal eye and dry eye. The results of McMonnies questionnaire, tear prism height measurement, Hardtack test, blink rate measurement and Schirmer test were compared with the results of NIBUT and TBUT. Results: The results of NIBUT and TBUT were as follows; 20 subjects had normal eyes, 10 subjects had dry eyes in both NIBUT and TBUT, and 10 subjects showed different results. In McMonnies questionnaire, the score of normal eye group averaged 8.2 and that of dry eye group averaged 18.5, which showed statistically significant difference. Furthermore, 100% of normal eye group classified by the results of NIBUT and TBUT corresponded with the result of McMonnies questionnaire and 90% of dry eye group showed the correspondence. Tear prism height of normal eye group averaged 0.32 mm and that of dry eye group averaged 0.23 mm, which were significantly different. Hardtack test, blink rate measurement and Schirmer test without local anesthesia showed no statistically significant difference between normal eye group and dry eye group. Conclusions: On dry eye diagnosis methods, the results of McMonnies questionnaire and tear prism height measurement had close correlation with the results of NIBUT and TBUT.",이병준,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106490387
고등학교 물리학 교과서에 제시된 광전효과 내용 분석,"This study was conducted to investigate the description of the photoelectric effect presented in the physics textbooks of the 2015 revised curriculum and to draw implications for the 2022 revised curriculum. For this purpose, 10 textbooks, both Physics I and physics II textbooks, that had been developed by the same publisher were analyzed. After examining the overall composition of the content on photoelectric effect presented in the physics textbooks, we established three analysis criteria: the inquiry activity, the experimental method and phenomenon explanation, and the interpretation of the photoelectric effect according to the model. Then, a detailed analysis was conducted according to these criteria. The results showed that Physics I textbooks tended to focus on the application of the photoelectric effect, and Physics II textbooks tended to focus on the explanation of the photoelectric effect. However, the structure of the detailed content of each textbook was different. In particular, in some textbooks, essential content was omitted, and the hierarchy of the content in the Physics I and the Physics II textbooks was unclear. In addition, the same contents were described repeatedly. Finally, the implications for the 2022 revised curriculum that can be derived from the results of this study are discussed.",하상우,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103823660
전기자동차용 배터리 팩 주위의 유동장 해석,"The battery pack o main component of NEV (Neighborhood Electric Vehicle), needs cooling system when it is charging or discharging to prevent the degradation of the battery charging efficiency. The purpose of this study is to analyse the effects of cooling methods, changing positions of inlet and outlet and changing area ratios of inlet and outlet. It has been observed that in the point of uniform cooling, suction from the exit side is more efficient than blowing from the inlet. And there is a suitable inlet/outlet area ratio in maximizing the mass flow rate. A commercial code, STAR-CCM+(ver. 4.02), was used for the numerical study.",김현수(H.S.

인체 조직에 적용을 위한 고강도 집속 초음파 기술의 연구,"High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been used in clinics as a non-invasive treatment for diseased tissue through ablation by focusing the ultrasonic energy to a target tissue in the human body. Thus, HIFU can be non-invasively applied to treat patients with some cancers. If the HIFU energy is to be focused to a target in the complex human body, a precise ray-tracing method/technique is necessary. Therefore, ultrasonic simulations for HIFU by calculating the HIFU beam fields in a biological multi-layered model through irregular surfaces can support the design and the operation of a HIFU system. In this study, the simulations were performed according to the parameters of the HIFU sensor and were applied to a humanized tissue structure for describing the result at focal point and measuring the pressure and the temperature rises around target. The possibility of predicting the path of the ultrasonic wave penetrating into unspecified human tissue was ascertained and the ultrasonic focusing efficiences were compared according to the design variables. In addition, the in-vivo temperature could be determined by calculating the heat energy as a function of the sound intensity.",황영인,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635437
