유아의 미디어 이용시간 실태와 자기조절력 및 문제행동과의 관계,"The purpose of this study was to examine the media use time of young children and to investigate the relationship between young children’s media use time, self-regulation, and problem behavior. The subjects of this study were 82 mothers of 82 children age 5-6 and eight teachers of the children who are attending six preschool facilities in the Seoul area. To measure the media use time of young children, we developed our questionnaire for this study with reference to Current Status and Protective Measures of Young Children’s Exposure to Media Devices (Jeongrim Lee, Namhee Do, Yu Jeong Oh, 2013). This study modified and revised the Self-Control Rating Scale (Kendall and Wilcox, 1979) and Children's Behavior Rating Scale (C-TRF) (Oh Kyung-Ja & Kim Young-A, 2010). The Pearson product moment correlation coefficient and the one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data. The results were as follow: first, the average media use time of young children was three hours and 54 minutes. Additionally, young children spent more media exposure time with parents and siblings, than the time they spent alone on media. Two, the aggressiveness of the children was higher with longer use time of smart devices, and boys had higher scores on emotional reactivity in internalizing problem behavior, as well as aggressiveness, and problem behavior in externalizing problem behavior.

구조적 가족치료와 전략적 가족치료의 통합적 접근,"The key concept of structural family therapy model is family structure, which is made of repeated interaction among family members. Related concepts of family structure are family subsystem, boundary, enmeshed and disengaged family. The purpose of structural family therapy is removal of symptoms(short-term) and restructuring the family and maintaining the changed family structure(ultimate purpose).
Strategic family therapy model emphasizes change itself rather than understanding the problem. It focuses on sequence of behaviors, communication types, and here and now approach. The symptom is often the power struggle among family members. Coalition across generation lines destroys the hierarchical structure, which generates dysfunctional triangles and perpetuates the symptoms Structural family therapy focused on techniques and developed innovational ways to change families.
There are many commonality between structural family therapy and strategic family therapy. First of all, couple subsystem is viewed as the most important and relatively stable system. Strengthening couple subsystem is often pursued in both models. Both models also are relatively short-term, focuses on directly dealing with problems rather than gaining insights about problems. Therapists, in both models, are more actively involved with family members, initiating many tactics of change. Skills are also similar. Joining with family, enactment, reframing and relabeling are common in both models. Of course, paradoxical intervention is more the characteristics of strategical family therapy model.
The concepts of family structure, use of specific and behavioral strategies fit Korean family. It may be particularly useful to solve fixated pattern of communication among family members and rigid hierarchical family.",신혜섭,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A327127

"대상관계이론의 관점에서 본 자녀양육과 자아발달: 클라인, 비온 그리고 위니컷을 중심으로","The modern psychoanalytic approach of object relations theory, in particular, has emphasized that human beings grow up and exist in interactional relationships. Furthermore, these theories purport that self-development occurs through internalizing those relationships. This study explores the relationship between parenting and self-development from the perspectives of Klein, Bion, and Winnicott’s object relations theories. These three theorists have highlighted primary caregivers’ critical role in a child’s self-development. This study focuses on the main concepts of these theorists, including “projective identification,” “containment,” and “holding.” The study examines the implications of each concept to better understand the role of parenting in a child’s self-development. The results of this study outline Klein’s “projective identification” as a defense mechanism. It serves as a child’s way of protecting themselves from anxieties due to death drive, while relating them to external objects. Bion’s containment theory provides perspective on the intersubjective relationship between a mother and child. This is critical in the context of the child’s self-development. Lastly, Winnicott emphasized the role of the mother as a holding environment for a child.",김은정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108324564
한국과 영국의 학교 성교육 비교 연구,"Sex education in the U.K. follows an ideal model, co-operation where ever possible between homes, schools, and communities, whereas in Korea schools are mostly responsible for sex education. Moreover, Central Government and LEAs are deeply involved in school sex education in the U.K., in contrasts the concrete help at Government level is very limited in Korea though the necessity of sex education is acknowledged. These differences be accounted for by the different social and cultural backgrounds of the two countries, especially given the different thoughts of the people-oriental and occidental- . In the U.K., sex education has been a compulsory subject in secondary schools since 1994 (by the Education Act 1993), and it is well managed with the support at Government level as compared with that of Korea. Sex education in the U.K. may give some lessons for practising and developing sex education in Korea because the people in both countries have similarly conservative thinking about school sex education and it is implemented very carefully in the U.K..

3D 가상의류 제작을 위한 가상원단과 실제원단의 드레이프 비교에 대한 연구,"Three-dimensional (3D) virtual garments imitate the silhouette and details of clothing in a virtual space on a computer without producing actual clothing and have been used in a variety of fields. As non-face-to-face services have become more popular in the fashion field, they are now being used for virtual models or digital fashion shows. As a result, the virtual garment must be similar to the real one. Drape is one of the factors that determines the silhouette of the garment. Thus, in this study, we compared the difference between real and virtual fabrics by using drape to confirm the similarity between the real and virtual fabrics. Fabrics were divided based on the fabric type and drape difference between the real and virtual fabrics. The experiment was carried out with the help of 287 woven and 318 knit fabrics. The drape ratio was used to test the drape quality of materials. By employing drape ratio, woven and knit fabrics were divided into seven grades, with eight fabrics selected for each grade. The drape ratio of the virtual and real fabrics was evaluated after creating virtual fabrics of selected fabrics using the CLO 3D application. Correlation analysis revealed that there is a correlation between the drape ratio of the real and virtual fabric for both woven and knit fabrics. However, t-test results demonstrate that there is a difference between the drape ratio of the real and virtual fabric, with the virtual fabric drape tending to be larger than the drape ratio of the real fabric. When fabrics were divided by type, the outer fabrics had the largest difference in drape between real and virtual. As drape property is affected by fabric functional processing, additional research is needed to determine what kind of functional processing affects the difference between real and virtual fabrics. In this study, physical and data were extracted from, and it is expected that this research can help contribute to the reproducibility of 3D modeling in the fashion field.",윤혜준(YOON HYE JUN),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107973086

In this study, we collected data from 568 middle school students in S, D and J cities, and analyzed them using the SPSS 20.0 and the SPSS PROCESS macro statistics program. From the data analysis, it was noted that the adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies had a mediating effect on the impact of cognitive and emotional empathy of parents on self-esteem. However, the maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies had only a mediating effect on the impact of emotional empathy of parents on self-esteem. As a result of the difference verification, parental empathy mainly affected self-esteem through the adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies. Therefore, raising parental empathy (cognitive/emotional) and adolescent's adaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies were essential factors for promoting self-esteem. We also need to enhance the emotional empathy of parents to promote self-esteem by reducing the effect of the adolescent's maladaptive cognitive emotion regulation strategies.",이진경,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107017508

Second, we investigate the factors affecting these four variables. The main analysis results shown in this study are as follows. First, most foreign patients were found to be highly satisfied with Korean hospital doctors and patient-oriented hospitals. In addition, more than 75 percent of foreign patients were willing to reuse Korean hospitals in the future. Second, a regression analysis of variables that affect satisfaction with Korean hospital doctors showed that the presence of long-term diseases affected. Specifically, if there is a disease in the long term, the satisfaction level of Korean hospital doctors is high. The factors that affect foreign patients satisfaction with the Korean hospital system were income and health conditions. The lower the income of foreign patients, the higher the satisfaction with the Korean hospital system in the case of positive perception of their health conditions. Meanwhile, the impact on the satisfaction of foreign patients with patient orientation in Korean hospitals was on whether they lived in Korea and recognized their health conditions. Foreign patients living abroad, not domestic residents, and foreign patients with positive perceptions of their health conditions showed high satisfaction with the patient-orientedness of Korean hospitals. Third, the regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors affecting the willingness of foreign patients to reuse Korean hospitals, and found that the medical expenses were borne by themselves, doctor satisfaction, and hospital system satisfaction. Foreign patients who do not pay for medical expenses showed high willingness to reuse Korean hospitals, while foreign patients with high satisfaction with Korean hospital doctors showed high willingness to reuse Korean hospitals.","손진석(Son, Jinsuk)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107973106

아버지와 어머니의 헬리콥터 부모역할이 고등학생의 진로준비 행동에 미치는 영향: 학업성패귀인과 진로결정자기효능감의 순차적 매개효과,"This study examined the sequential mediation effects of academic achievement attribution and career decision-making self-efficacy on the effect of paternal and maternal helicopter parenting on high-school students' career preparation behavior. A total of 285 (119 male and 166 female) Korean high-school students in the second grade participated in the study. Research variables were measured using the Career Preparation Behavior Scale (Kim, 1997), Helicopter Parenting Scale (LeMoyne & Buchanan, 2011), Attribution Questionnaire (Weiner, 1979), and Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (Betz et al., 1996). To examine the sequential mediating effect, data analysis was performed using SPSS 29.0 and PROCESS MACRO (v4.2) Model 6. The results revealed no correlations between helicopter parenting and academic failure attribution. However, higher paternal and maternal helicopter parenting were found to indirectly reduce high-school students' career preparation behavior through lower internal academic success attribution (effort and ability) and higher external academic success attribution (task difficulty and luck), which reduced career decision-making self-efficacy. These findings can be employed to develop more effective intervention programs comprising career guidance for adolescents, which emphasizes the negative effect of helicopter parenting. This study expands the research field, as previous findings on helicopter parenting mostly focus on college students.",김윤서,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108727274
기관 내외 교육과 어머니의 영어교육 신념이 유아의 영어 흥미에 미치는 영향: 일반유치원과 영어학원 유치부의 비교,"This study investigated children’s interests in learning English, affected by educational activities in and out of institutes, and mothers’ perceptions regarding early childhood English education. We recruited, 253 mothers of 3- to 5-year-old children in either general kindergartens or English immersion institutes. They answered questions on socioeconomic status, perceived interest in English by their children, their perceptions regarding early childhood English education, and English education outside institutes. In addition, 42 English teachers provided information within institutes such as class time per week, teacher-pupil rate, and language use policy during class. The collected data were analyzed through SPSS 22 for frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, independent t-test, and hierarchical multiple regression analysis. The major findings are as follows. First, the two groups were in distinct learning environment. Second, mothers’ perceptions and outside-institute activities were significantly different between the two groups. Third, the English interests of children at both institutes were influenced by mothers’ worries and at-home English interactions. Fourth, education within institutes did not affect both group’s English interests. Fifth, private education and socioeconomic status did not affect both group’s English interests. Lastly, only the children’s interests in English immersion institutes were affected by gender and mother’s perceived necessities. Focusing children’s interests, this study helps in understanding young children’s affective aspects regarding learning English. The findings are expected to be a guideline for each home and institute to increase children’s interest in learning English.",최나야 ( Naya Choi ),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107149554

보육교사의 사회적 지지와 회복탄력성이 행복감에 미치는 영향,"This study attempted to examine how the general background, social support, and resilience of childcare teachers affect happiness.
To this end, 300 childcare teachers working at national, public, workplace, private, home, and corporate daycare centers in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do were surveyed and analyzed using SPSS 21.0 statistics. The analysis results are as follows.
First, as a result of analyzing social support, resilience, and happiness according to the general background of teachers, low-care teachers of less than 1 year and middle-care teachers of more than 5 to 7 years had high interpersonal skills, while high-care teachers of more than 7 to 10 years had low interpersonal skills. In terms of differences according to the educational background of childcare teachers, graduate school and older were higher in happiness, resilience overall, and positivity, while those in their 40s and 50s were higher than those in their 20s in terms of happiness, resilience, self-regulation, and positivity. According to the number of children of childcare teachers, childcare teachers with three or more children had the highest overall social support and overall happiness information and emotional support, material support, evaluation support, and resilience sub-factors. In the difference according to the marital status of teachers, information support, a sub-factor of social support, was high in unmarried teachers, and self-regulation ability and positivity were high in married teachers. The overall resilience, sub-factors, and happiness of childcare teachers preparing to change jobs were higher than those who were not preparing to change jobs.
Second, as a result of analyzing the correlation between social support (people in the workplace, people outside the workplace), resilience, and happiness of childcare teachers, there was a static correlation between all two variables. In the results of the correlation analysis by sub-factor, there was no significant correlation between the two variables in the relationship between self-regulation, a sub-factor of resilience, and information support in the workplace, a sub-factor of social support. Third, as a result of examining the general background of childcare teachers (education, age, number of children, preparation for change), social support (people in the workplace, non-workplace), and resilience, the relative explanatory power of childcare teachers was statistically significant.
In other words, it can be seen that the educational background of childcare teachers, the number of children, social support and resilience of people in the workplace are important in terms of the happiness of childcare teachers. These results suggest that in order to promote teachers’ happiness, various institutional and policy support is needed to provide social support through various networks, and the creation of an organizational culture that harmonizes and communicates with each other is required. It was also confirmed that the provision of education or programs to foster resilience can positively contribute to the psychological well-being of childcare teachers.",김혜선,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108661480
사회적 지지가 중년 여성의 생활 스트레스에 미치는 영향: 자아존중감의 매개효과를 중심으로,"The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between social support, self-esteem, and life stress in middle-aged women, and to investigate the mediating effect of self-esteem in the relationship between social support and life stress in middle-aged women.
For this purpose of the study, an analysis was conducted using SPSS 23.0 after conducting a survey of 356 middle-aged women aged 40 to 64 living in Seoul and the metropolitan area of Gyeonggi-do. In this study, the average difference test was conducted to examine the differences in major variables according to demographic characteristics, the correlation analysis between social support, self-esteem, and life stress variables of middle-aged women, and the mediation analysis was conducted using Process macro program, and the significance of mediation was verified by the bootstrapping method. The results of the study are as follows. First, as a result of the correlation analysis between social support, self-esteem, and life stress of middle-aged women, there was a significant correlation between all three variables. Second, the mediating role of self-esteem in the relationship between social support and life stress of middle-aged women was examined. Social support was divided into sub-factors, family support and other support, and life stress was also divided into relationship areas and task areas to analyze a total of four models. As a result, it was found that self-esteem partially mediated in the relationship between social support and life stress problems. Through these results, the direct effect of social support on life stress and indirect effect through self-esteem were revealed, and it was confirmed that self-esteem was a useful internal resource for reducing the life stress of middle-aged women.",윤혜경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108661482
한·중 유통기업의 ESG 경영에 대한 2030 소비자 인식 연구 : 쿠팡과 타오바오에 대한 IPA를 중심으로,"This study explores consumer perceptions of ESG management by distribution companies in Korea and China. A total of 2030 consumers completed an online survey about either Coupang in Korea or Taobao in China. The results confirmed the level of satisfaction-importance that consumers felt concerning ESG management. The survey consisted of 196 items, and the analysis was conducted using SPSS 26.0. The findings showed that both Korean and Chinese consumers were aware of the importance of ESG. For Korean consumers, the order of importance was E>S>G. For Chinese consumers, it was S>E>G, and the area that showed the biggest difference among the ESG indicators was G, which is believed to reflect the influence of China’s political system. According to the satisfaction-importance analysis, consumers in both countries showed low satisfaction with the distribution companies’ environmental management but high satisfaction with the ethical management corresponding to corporate soundness, transparency, and interest in communities, including rural communities. There was a great difference between the two companies in terms of consumer satisfaction, possibly due to the controversy over Coupang’s avoidance of responsibility related to consumer protection. This study is significant in that it explores ESG management from the consumer’s point of view. It shows that specific efforts and transparency are needed because consumers are aware of ESG management and evaluate its quality by distribution companies.","김수연(Kim, Su-yeon)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107839799

비타민C가 혈액암세포에 미치는 영향,"L-Ascorbic acid (LAA) is being investigated clinically for the treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on the observed effects of LAA on AML progenitor cells in vitro. However. the mechanism for LA A-induced cytoreduction remains to be elucidated. LAA at concentrations of 0.25-1.0mM induced a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation in three AML cell lines and also in leukemic cells from peripheral blood specimens obtained from three patients with AML. Flow cytometric analysis showed that LAA at concentrations of 0.25-I.0mM could significantly induce apoptosis in the AML cell lines. LAA induced oxidation of glutathione to oxidized form (GSSG) and subsequent H_(2)O_(2) accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. in parallel to induction of apoptosis. The direct role of H_(2)O_(2) in the induction of apoptosis in AML cells was clearly demonstrated by the finding that catalase could completely abrogate LAA-induced apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis in LAA-treated AML cells involved a dose-dependent increase of Bax protein. release of cytochrome C from mitochondria to cytosol, activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, and cleavage of poly[ADP-ribose]polymerase. In conclusion, LAA can induce apoptosis in AML cells. and this is clearly due to HzOz which accumulates intracellularly as a result of oxidation of reduced glutathione by LAA. There is a continuing interest in cellular antioxidants and oxidants, and with the mechanisms that cells possess for dealing with their effects. One of the most important mechanisms is mediated via the widely distributed tripeptide thiol glutathione (L--glutamyl-L-cysteinyl glycine, GSH). Here, we report the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of GSH and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 and NB4 cells, treated with LAA.",박세연,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75057762
4세 유아들의 그림책에 대한 반응 고찰,"Many young people, nowadays, are not interested in Buddhist life styles, or many Christians have some inappropriate prejudice about Buddhist cultural heritages. Young parents seldom recognize and try to introduce Korean traditional culture including Buddhist heritage to their children. It's a very big problem to lose precious spiritual roots of Korean cultural characteristics. So, this paper tries to examine young children's experiences of Korean traditional culture related to Buddhism.
The purpose of this paper is to find out what 4 year old children think about Buddhist life styles expressed in a picture book, ""How did the Buddhist-monks live in the old days?"" The picture book, with very beautiful pictures and poetic words, shows how the monks thought, practiced, and lived as Buddhists. The picture book was shown and read to 16 4-year-old children of a kindergarten attached to D university and the children were asked some questions related to its content and meanings.
According to the result, all children could feel and understand the meaning of compassion that the monks had consideration for all the creatures and practiced the good for all beings. They understood why the monks, in the picture book, practiced compassion with various ways and methods, and expressed their own thoughts and ways for saving other lives. Some children who had experiences about Buddhism on TV, video, or visiting temples in mountains, no matter whether their parents were Buddhists or not, had known Buddha, monks, temples, etc. And they tried to explain what they have known and experienced with their families. In contrast, a few children who had never experienced Buddhism or related cultural activities, they had no Buddhist concepts, no interests in that kind of parts. The results showed that it's important whether they had chance to experience the traditional culture or not.
These results will contribute to rediscover the value of Korean traditional Buddhist cultures and to recognize the beautiful and pro-ecological Buddhist life styles in post-modern society and recent wellbeing moods. Above all, those will show how desirable it is to introduce Buddhism to future generations and to share it with them.",정대련,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75057775
