음식물 쓰레기를 줄이기 위한 체계화 연구(Ⅰ),"This research was conducted to estimate waste rates of 69 food items after pre-preparation and amounts of food wastes disposed and it's reduction effect by education in some institutional foodservices for reduction of the food wastes.
The result are as follows:
1. The waste rates were 55.40% for sweet corn, 5.73% for potatoes, 19.14% for sweet potatoes, and 33.47% for chestnuts.
2. The waste rates of fruits were 0.21~49.36%. Food items with over 40% waste rate were banana, watermelon, and pineapple.
3. The waste rates of vegetables were 1.14~52.90%. The number of foods with under 10% waste rate were 14 items(red pepper, green pepper, chard, and so on), 10~20% was 9 items(perilla leaf, Chinese cabbage, ginger root, and so on), 20~30% was 5 items(root of Chinese bellflower, garlic, radish-leaves, burdock, welsh onion-large type), 30~40% was 3 items(shepherd's purse, head lettuce, kale) and over 40% was 3 items(water dropwort, crown daisy, mallow).
4. The waste rates were 24.30% in chicken, 9.53~13.79% in eggs, and 9.30~55.32% in fishes. The waste rates of vegetables and fishes were higher than those of other food groups.
5. There were significantly different in amount of food wastes disposed (g／person／day) to institutional foodservices(hospital＞ industrial institution＞ Korean restaurant＞ elementary school). The amount of food wastes disposed, especially amount in pre-preparation phase, after education for reduction of food wastes was significantly reduced.
6. Since these study results show significant deviations in food waste rates and education effect, there should be more studies for standard waste rates of each food and systematic education method for reduction of food wastes.",전예숙,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45018058
대학생들의 가치관에 따른 전공만족도와 진로성숙도에 관한 연구,"This study aimed to investigate major satisfaction and career maturity according to the values of college students majoring in food management and culinary arts. To do this, frequency analysis, factor analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple regression were conducted and analyzed using SPSS18.0 program. Analysis results indicate that the values of the college students majoring in dining and culinary education have effects on major satisfaction and career maturity. In particular, pragmatic value is a very important factor in increasing major satisfaction and career maturity, and social recognition and curriculum factors are very significant for students to make career decisions. Therefore, in order to enhance college students` major satisfaction and career maturity, it`s necessary to teach sound values so that they can build self-esteem value. Also, it`s essential to organize subject contents and curriculums in which theory and practice are allocated properly so that students can be interested in their majors and have new experience as well as the community`s right recognition for college students majoring in dinning and culinary education and their active interest as the study suggests.",한예정(Yae Jung Han),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100059762
단백질 섭취기준,"This study assessed the current EAR, RDA, and AMDR for protein, which were set in 2005 and revised in 2010 as the DRIs for Koreans. A classical approach to establish the EAR for protein has been the nitrogen balance method. This method has practical limitations and problems in statistical analysis by giving over estimations of nitrogen balance. Thus, the present EAR for protein might be lower than the true requirement. Recent reevaluations of nitrogen balance studies by bilinear regression analysis and the IAAO method have indicated that the EAR of 0.66 g/kg bw/d should be increased by 39% to give 0.92 g/kg bw/d. The AMDR for protein in the Korean DRIs was set at 7-10%, which covers almost the entire population’s protein intake. Since the 5th percentile of Korean protein intake is close to 10% of energy and due to the beneficial effects of protein beyond the maintenance of nitrogen equilibrium, the lower range of 7% needs to be increased up to 10%. For practical meal arrangement, 15% of energy as protein, which is close to the average protein intake of Koreans, seems to be proper, although the value is almost two times the EAR.

채식주의자 식품소비가치에 따른 채식기반식품과 채식식당에 대한 인식,"The purpose of this study was to provide basic data for future research and suggest product development and market segmentation strategies by identifying the perceptions and consumption behaviors of vegetarians in each segment of the vegetarian market. According to food consumption value, a total of three market segments were derived, and the markets were named based on their characteristics, including 'environment and animal protection', 'multiple consideration' and 'low interest'. As a result of analyzing the perception of vegetarian-based food, ""environment and animal protection"" and ""multiple consideration"" presented positive perceptions of a vegetarian food product. Conversely, the group stating low interest expressed negative perceptions of the vegetarian food product. An analysis of the requirements for development for vegetarian-based foods products (eg. aquafaba), indicated that the development requirements for all products, except cultured and processed meats, were high.?Considerable demand was observed for vegetarian menus and vegetarian restaurants. As a result of the analysis on the necessity of the elements of the vegetarian restaurant menu, the subjects that stated ""multiple consideration"" had significantly higher awareness of issues related to vegetarian foods than others.",김하영,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107907612
제6기 국민건강영양조사를 토대로 분석한 한국 성인의 당뇨병과 빈혈 관계,"Anemia, defined as a reduction in the hemoglobin concentration of blood, is common in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, can be potentially caused by diabetes complications such as nephropathy. Recent research suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) itself may be a major risk factor of anemia. However, there are few Korean studies on the relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and anemia. This study was performed to investigate the association between anemia and diabetes mellitus (DM) in Korean adults. A total of 10,151 Korean adults over aged 19 years (4,422 male, 5,729 female) were selected from the participants of the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey VI (KNHANES VI). Korean adults with anemia had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) than the normal adults (11.4% vs. 30.4% in male, 8.8% vs. 9.4% in female). The unadjusted odds ratio (OR) for anemia was greater in adults with DM than in normal male (OR=3.28; 95% CI: 2.27∼4.73). After adjusting for other risk factors including age, education, family income, smoking, drinking, and menstrual status, anemia and diabetes were not associated (OR=1.33; 95% CI: 0.84∼ 2.09). Similarly, there was no association between anemia and diabetes in female. In conclusion, this study shows that the prevalence of anemia is similar in diabetic and non-diabetic Korean adults after adjusting for multiple risk factors. Further research is required to elucidate the mechanism of anemia caused as a con-sequence of diabetes mellitus (DM).",이애리 ( Ae-ri Lee ),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102716911
한국 일부 20∼30대 성인의 음료 섭취와 비만도와의 관련성,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between daily beverage intake and obesity in young adults. This cross-sectional study was conducted with 256 adults in their 20s and 30s. Obesity was evaluated by anthropometric measurement of body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio and waist to height ratio. In addition, the daily intake of milk, caffeinated beverages, sweetened beverages, and alcoholic beverages was investigated using the dietary record and 24-h recall methods. Based on the BMI, men and women were classified into underweight, normal, overweight and obese. Among men, 38.3% were found to be normal, 28.1% were overweight and 31.3% obese. Among women, 11.7% were underweight, 73.4% were normal, and 10.2% were overweight, which was significantly different from men. In women, the BMI of the milk consumers was significantly lower than the non-consumers. Also, the obesity indices of caffeinated beverage consumers were significantly lower than the non-consumers. An analysis of the correlation between beverage intake and the obesity index showed that the intake of caffeinated beverages among women had a significant negative correlation with the obesity index, and intake of alcoholic beverages had a significant positive correlation with waist to height ratio. This study suggests that intake of milk and caffeinated beverage may have a positive effect on obesity, whereas the intake of alcoholic beverages may have a negative effect, especially in young adult women.",이연경 ( Yeon-kyung Lee ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108512138

A total of 4,507 subjects were divided into two groups: sleep hours＜7 (lack of sleep, LS) and 7≤ sleep hours (normal sleep, NS). For a more detailed analysis, the subjects were further divided into normal sleep with no depression (NSND) and lack of sleep with depression (LSWD) groups. When compared with NS group, the nutrient intake of the LS group was observed to be higher in carbohydrates (P＜0.05) and thiamine (P＜0.01), but had a significantly lower mean nutrient adequacy ratio (P＜0.05). Also, the LS group showed a higher frequency of early menopause (P＜0.001) and depression (P＜0.05) than the NS group. In the analysis of anthropometry and blood parameters of the subjects based on their sleep duration, the LS group showed a lower body mass index (BMI, P＜0.05), lower blood creatinine (P＜0.01), glycated hemoglobin (P＜0.05), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (P＜0.01) levels adjusted by age and menopause than the NS group. When compared to the NSND group, the LSWD group had a lower intake of cholesterol (P＜0.05), vitamin A (P＜0.05), vitamin C (P＜0.05), and folic acid (P＜0.05).

대체 단백질을 활용한 미래형 푸드테크 분석 연구,"Purpose: This study was conducted to contribute to the vitalization of the food industry through the analysis of future food technology for producing alternative proteins. The demand for protein is expected to increase due to population growth, but it may be difficult to match protein production compared to the demand. Methods: Food technology for the production of alternative proteins to meet the demand was examined through paper and patent analysis. Results: Meat production that relies on traditional livestock farming cannot meet the growing protein demand, due to climate change and resource depletion. Alternative protein is a future food technology that can replace the traditional livestock industry, which in turn can revitalize the sustainable food industry and contribute to economic growth. Alternative proteins are mainly classified into cultured meat, edible insects, and alternative vegetable proteins. Cultured meat refers to edible protein obtained by collecting live animal cells and multiplying them using cell engineering technology. Proteins extracted from edible insects may also be used in food material. Plant-based protein alternatives include technology that uses plant-derived proteins to manufacture foods similar to livestock foods such as meat and eggs. Through the analysis of future food technology for alternative proteins, we have attempted to examine the competitiveness of original technology that can replace the traditional livestock industry. Conclusion: The results of this study provided information on the development of new source technologies by combining various food technologies involving cultured meat, edible insects, and vegetable protein as replacements for traditional livestock protein.",용해인 ( Hae In Yong ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107905356

KoGES 안성 코호트 연구 자료를 활용한 중년층 성인의 골격근량에 따른 건강 및 식이요인 분석,"Purpose: Sarcopenia is an age-related disorder characterized by a decrease in muscle mass, grip strength, and physical capacity. Large cohort studies evaluating sarcopenia and diet quality have been lacking and have yielded inconsistent results. This study was undertaken to investigate the relationship between diet quality and skeletal muscle mass in 40-69 year adults. Methods: All data for this study were obtained from a population-based prospective cohort study, the Korean Genome Epidemiological Survey (KoGES). A total of 1,124 men and women aged 40 to 69 years, residing in Ansung who participated in KoGES, were followed up every 2 years from 2001-2002 to 2013-2014 to confirm low skeletal muscle mass. We estimated skeletal muscle mass by applying lean body mass; the skeletal muscle mass was estimated by dividing the body weight and multiplying by 100 to express the skeletal muscle mass index (SMI). A Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to analyze the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals of low SMI according to diet quality at baseline and was gender-specific. Results: During the 12-year follow-up period, a total of 413 subjects (36.7%) had low SMI. This study did not find any significant association between diet quality and low SMI. Conclusion: Although several cross-sectional studies have shown an association between diet quality and sarcopenia, results are varied and there is insufficient evidence in cohort studies validating that diet quality affects sarcopenia. Therefore, additional large-scale studies are required to confirm the association between diet quality and sarcopenia in middle-aged people.",장지은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108648920
"영양교육과 운동중재 프로그램이 성인비만여성의 신체성분과 식이섭취, 혈중지질 및 기초체력에 미치는 효과 (2)","This study examined how the participation rates contribute to subjects’ outcomes after a nutrition education (once/ week) and exercise (3 times/week) intervention program for 12 weeks in 44 obese female subjects. The subjects were divided into two groups: high-participator (HP) or low-participator (LP) groups according to their participation levels based on the median visit value (30 visits out of a total of 48 visits). Daily nutrient intakes assessed by a 24-hour recall, body composition, blood lipid profiles and physical fitness were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks. After the intervention, weight, BMI, percent body fat, and the waist-hip ratio were significantly decreased in the HP group. In addition, the HP group had a greater rates of changes in weight (HP group: -6.6% and LP group: -3.1%, p < 0.01), BMI (-7.0% and -3.2%, p < 0.01), percent body fat (-7.8% and -4.2%, p < 0.05), and waist-hip ratio (-3.1% and -0.4%, p < 0.01) compared to the LP group. Energy-adjusted protein, fiber, potassium, vitamin B₁, vitamin B？, and vitamin C were significantly increased in the HP group. The HP group showed a significant increase in HDLcholesterol and a decrease in blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and atherogenic index (AI). While the muscle endurance, muscle strength, power, agility and flexibility were significantly increased in the HP group, agility and balance were improved in the LP group. In addition, dietary behavior score was significantly increased and stress score decreased in the HP group compared to the LP group. High participation rates were correlated with the improvement of the nutrient density (protein, fiber, potassium, Vitamin B₁, Vitamin B₂, Vitamin B？ and folate), anthropometric parameters (body weight, BMI and percent body fat), serum lipid profiles (HDL-cholesterol, Triglyceride, and AI) and physical fitness (muscle endurance) adjusted for age, menopausal status, alcohol drinking, nutritional supplement use and baseline BMI.

대체당 알룰로스를 이용한 고추장 양념장의 주요 방향 화합물 특성,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the flavor characteristics of the Gochujang condiment and its flavor compounds when it was heated with the addition of allulose. Methods: The Gochujang condiment samples were prepared with the addition of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% allulose, and sugar for sweetness and heated for 30 minutes. The solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME) method was used to capture the flavor aroma, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) were used for the analysis. Results: The volatile flavor components were analyzed to evaluate the flavor characteristics of the processed Gochujang condiment. A total of 43 volatile flavor components were identified with the heat treatment, among which diallyl trisulfide showed the highest peak, and diallyl disulfide, methyl-2-propenyl trisulfide, β-phellandrene, and β-caryophyllene also had high peaks. These five high-peak ingredients play an important role in determining the taste of the Gochujang condiment. It was confirmed that the volatile component was diallyl trisulfide, which increased as the allulose content increased. A total of 16 flavoring active ingredients of the condiment were identified. Also, most sulfur compounds and terpene were identified. Allyl methyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, β-phellandrene, and methyl 2-propenyl trisulfide played an important role in the flavoring of the Gochujang condiment.
Conclusion: The main volatile components of the flavor compounds generated by the heat treatment included diallyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, methyl-2-propenyl trisulfide, β-phellandrene, and β-caryophyllene with high peak areas. The quantum of diallyl trisulfide increased as the allulose content increased. Allyl methyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, diallyl disulfide, β-phellandrene, and methyl 2-propenyl trisulfide were identified as flavoring active compounds, and each of these contributed to the flavor of the Gochujang condiment.",오희선,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108118671
논문 : 대학생의 수면시간에 따른 식습관 및 체조성에 관한 연구,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sleep duration on dietary habits and body composition of university students. Sleep duration has recently been added to the list of risk factors for obesity. However, studies on this topic are fairly limited particularly in Korea. We studied the relationship between the duration of sleep and obesity principally based on body mass index and %body fat in university students. For this purpose, a survey was conducted on a total of 312 university students. The subjects enrolled for this study were divided into two groups: (1) those with sleep duration of <7 hours (148students) and (2) those with sleep duration of >7 hours (164 students). Based on a self-reporting method, the participants filled up the questionnaires for more than 20 minutes. Based on the overall data obtained, we observed that most students (52.88%) skipped breakfast. This was mainly due to shortage of time (60.58%). We also observed that self-reporting dietary preferences included eating irregular meals (49.04%), overeating (19.55%), imbalanced diet (16.35%), and skipping meals (9.94%). It was found that cookies were the favorite snacks in the majority of the participants (50%). Our data reveal that the body mass index, fat mass, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat, respectively of the shorter sleep duration group (<7 h/day) were 23.78 kg/m2, 19.13 kg, 2.23 kg, and 11.15 kg. In contrast, in those of the control group (7 h/day), these values were found to be 21.84 kg/m2, 13.88 kg, 1.56 kg, and 12.11 kg. We also observed that there were significant correlations of sleep duration with body mass index (p<0.05), fat mass (p<0.01), visceral fat (p<0.01), and beck depression score (p<0.01). Our data suggest that the body mass index in the shorter sleep duration group was higher than that of the control group; however, %fat, visceral fat, and subcutaneous fat in the shorter sleep duration group were found to be higher than those of the control group. The data obtained through our study suggest that short sleep duration is clearly associated with a modest increase in general and abdominal obesity particularly in university students.",김경희 ( Kyung Hee Kim ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99851257

A total of 1,209 subjects were analyzed among the participants of the 2014 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Statistical methods for a complex sample were applied by using SPSS program(windows ver. 24.0). Depression assessments were carried out by using the 9-item depression module of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Depression (PHQ-9≥5) was more frequently found in females (33.2%) compared to males (16.1%). However, there was no evidence suggesting that characteristics such as residence area, income level and age, except for educational level, were related with depression. The results of the logistic regression analysis showed that i) health habits such as smoking (OR: 2.26) and lack of aerobic physical activity (OR: 1.62), ii) mental health status such as bad self-rating of health status (OR: 4.30), more stress (OR: 8.31), and bad health-related quality of life (by EQ_5D, OR: 3.41), iii) chronic diseases such as obesity (OR: 0.66), hypercholesterolemia (OR: 1.57), anemia (OR: 1.91), and iv) low intake of energy (OR: 1.84) and calcium (OR: 1.71) were significantly associated with depression. This study suggests that certain characteristics of health habits, mental health status, chronic diseases and nutrient intake may be associated with depression. Prospective research on long-term control is needed to establish causal connections among those factors with depression.",이혜상 ( Hye-sang Lee ),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105319911
