패션 기반 통합디자인을 위한 페르소나 개념,"The concept of persona is an essential part of a user-research technique in the field of integrated design, which includes product, visual, and fashion designs, based on the principles of design thinking methodology. However, in the research of fashion-based integrated design, the concept of persona is not limited to user-research techniques, and it is used in various phases of the fashion industry process. Nevertheless, theoretical research on the conceptual characteristics of persona in integrated design remains insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to formulate differentiated persona concepts in fashion-based integrated design by classifying the characteristics of persona concepts used in the fashion industry process. As a research method, the concept of UX design persona, which is predominantly used in integrated design, was examined through literature review. The characteristics of persona concepts used in the fashion industry process were analyzed to identify the discriminatory features of fashion persona, extensively used at various stages of the fashion industry process. As a result, this study identified the following features of fashion persona that could be applied in the field of fashion-based integrated design. Firstly, in the design planning stage, the persona concept can be used as a user-research technique, similar to the UX persona technique. Secondly, it can be used as an extended tool concept to personify the brand or express the identity of designers and consumers as a marketing strategy. This concept can be used in combination with those of existing fashion muses and ambassadors as a tool for consumer communication, however its use will require specific theoretical definitions. In conclusion, the persona concept in the field of fashion-based integrated design, is not limited to user researches at the design stage but can be expanded to various phases of the fashion industry process as a strategy for promotion and communication which can represent user identity. The establishment of persona concepts for fashion-based integrated design will contribute to developing the diversity of methodologies and laying the related theoretical foundation in the field of integrated design, which is expected to expand rapidly with technological development.",신승원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639678

지속가능을 위한 현대 패션의 창의적 새활용,"The movement of sustainability for humanity and the environment is no longer an option but an essential. While the past society engaged in discarding generated waste, the current society focuses on reducing the amount of generated waste and minimizing the negative environmental impact by utilizing the method of resource circulation. This phenomenon leads to lots of research and developments on eco-friendly fashion, upcycling fashion, and conscious fashion for sustainability. Hence, it causes a change in consciousness from consumers and companies to have ethical values in the production and consumption processes. Creative reuse is beginning to attract attention as a new paradigm and represents the concept of production and consumption with not only ethical value but artistic value. Therefore, this research examines a movement of contemporary fashion based on social and ethical responsibility, and it classifies creative reuse design examples presented in designers and fashion brands into three different categories to derive the formative characteristics and significance. The three different categories are as follows: creative reuse of the discarded or stock fabric in the clothing production process, creative reuse of extra stock attires, and creative reuse of package wastes. This study is meaningful to achieve the complementary development of the environment and fashion for creative reuse to present the possibility of development differentiated from sustainable fashion design, which mainly focuses on resource circulation. By utilizing a wide range of waste, a fashion industry can reach resource circulation to sustain sufficient resource life span. It is expected for the fashion industry to obtain important social and ethical value from using characteristics of waste as design components.

소셜 미디어에 나타난 패션 액티비즘 - 이상미 해체 현상을 중심으로 -,"In the fashion industry, the appearance of plus-size models, senior models, colored race models and disabled models, which have never been seen before, can be seen frequently. Behind this phenomenon is the huge impact of social media. Social media are capable of sharing and communicating information among users, revealing their identity and individuality, and raising society’s awareness of problems to the surface. The purpose of this study is to examine the fashion activism that resists idealism in the social media of an individual, a non-mainstream space.
As for the research methodology, literature and case studies were conducted together. Through literature review, I examined the relationship between fashion and social media and conceptualized fashion activism. Based on above, fashion activism against ideal beauty through social media was analyzed and each case was also analyzed. The scope of the research is limited to the period from 2012 to 2019. The research results are as follows. First, the phenomenon of deconstructing the size of the body away from the traditional ideal was ‘the body positive movement’ centered on a plus-size model. Second, the phenomenon of disintegrating age in protest of entrenched aesthetic consciousness found the emergence of senior models. Third, non-white people and disabled models emerged as a move to recognize the diversity of beauty following the body positive movement of social media above and the emergence of senior models. With the advent of the Web 2.0 era, fashion-activists resisted the ideal that has become entrenched through social media. Their move has mainstreamized nonmainstream objects in the fashion industry and sought to recognize diversity in beauty. However, it is worth noting whether this movement is a commercial tool to attract public attention in the fashion world. Although it started as a personal non-mainstream movement, it can be thought of in terms of the contradiction and double-sidedness that is promoted to the mainstream of the fashion world after receiving the benediction of fashion. The move has continued since 2012, and we could see that the fashion industry is moving as part of a huge cultural capital and this movement will continue in the future.",정수진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106919069

베트남 MZ세대의 다차원적 소비가치에 대한 연구 -소비가치 요인과 인구통계학적 특성 및 글로벌 소비성향의 관련성을 중심으로-,"As an emerging market with rapid economic growth, while being a key region of the K-culture expansion, Vietnam draws increasing scientific attention. This study focuses on the MZ generation, Vietnam's leading consumer group, revealing their consumption value structure. An online survey was used for data collection purposes, investigating 368 Vietnamese consumers between 18-37 years of age. Six value dimensions were derived as results of the present analysis: functional, emotional, social, ethical, self-expression, and autonomy-oriented value. Among them, functional value includes two sub-dimensions of utility and price, while emotional value entails three sub-dimensions, namely hedonism, novelty, and aesthetics. ‘Self-expression value’ and ‘autonomy-oriented value’, reflecting the characteristics of the MZ generation, who actively express themselves and respect proactive decision-making, are becoming important standards of the consumption attitude of young Vietnamese. Moreover, the pursuit of ‘novelty’ was derived as a factor reflecting emotional values, revealing an association between hedonic consumption, and seeking for newness and difference. Furthermore, the relationships between each consumption value dimension, respective demographic characteristics, and global consumption propensity were investigated. The present findings aim to provide insights into young Vietnamese consumers' attitudes and intend to serve as a foundation for future research.",추호정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108333333
체험형 패션 매장 내 체험적 요소가 점포 애착을 매개로 소비자 충성도에 미치는 영향 -패션 혁신성의 조절효과를 중심으로-,"As more consumers have turned to online shopping since the COVID-19 pandemic, communication through offline channels has also entered a new phase. Young consumers recognize offline channels as a play space for enjoying various experience elements. Applying Pine and Gilmore's (1998) experiential economy theory, this study initially explores the structure of experience factors in the context of experiential fashion stores (RQ1). Next, we investigate the effect of experience factors on consumer loyalty by mediating store attachment (RQ2). In addition, the moderating effect of fashion innovativeness was verified (RQ3). This survey targeted members of the MZ generation who have visited experiential fashion stores. A total of 225 survey responses were ana- lyzed using AMOS 22.0 and SPSS 26.0. First, as a result of factor analysis, the experience factors of experi- ential fashion stores were classified into education, escapism, and aesthetic entertainment. Secondly, as a result of structural equation modeling (SEM), all three experience factors positively affected store attachment, and in- creased attachment positively enhanced consumer loyalty. Finally, as a result of multigroup SEM analysis, con- sumers with low fashion innovativeness considered educational experience as an important factor in inducing store attachment, while consumers with high fashion innovativeness value escapism and aesthetic entertain- ment experiences.",김우빈,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108570912
연구논문 : 대중음악의 시각화를 통한 텍스타일 프린트 패턴디자인 발상,"This study develops textile pattern design ideas created through the visualization of music. Methods of auditory and synesthesia were employed to analyze various attributes of popular music genres and appoint language image, shape image, and color image to obtain their interrelationships. This study provides data that can be used to express emotional images on textile print pattern designs. This research used different genres of popular music as stimuli. The language image was extracted and introduced to the overall color scheme; in addition, the color image was verified. The analysis of the color image was executed by applying it with the color set image scale of I.R.I colors. Then, the color image of the target genre of popular music was examined and analyzed through a color tone system. The preference in shape image was realized through visual images based on basic principles of points, lines, and sides composition; subsequently, an analysis of the emotional image of popular music followed. An examination of the emotional images of different popular music genres have led to the discovery that language image, color image, and shape image all share a common emotional image. There was also a realization that similarity and interrelationship exists in language, color, and shape images experienced by listening to popular music.",김지연 ( Ji Yeon Kim ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100768297
3DP 폴리머-패브릭(3D Print Polymer-Fabric Structure)을 적용한 패션디자인 연구,"Despite efforts to apply 3D print (3DP) technology in the field of fashion and endless discussions about thepossibility of future development, in reality, it is difficult to utilize 3DP technology in fashion for reasons related to mate-rial, technology, and cost constraints. The purpose of this study was to supplement the limitations of 3DP technology inorder to promote its utilization in fashion and simultaneously find a solution to achieve aesthetic satisfaction in the designmethod. Specifically, through the development of fashion products with a 3DP polymer-fabric structure to which the para-metric design methodology has been applied, this study explored the possibility of practical application and proposes a new3DP fashion design method. The 3DP polymer-fabric developed as a result of the research was stably adhered to the fab-ric. Additionally, the study confirmed the possibility of making 3DP clothes that are amenable to the wearer's activities,as it was verified that cutting and sewing tailored to the human body’s curvature and structure can be performed. Thedesign process using the 3DP polymer-fabric presented in this study is meaningful in that it suggests a solution to com-plement the limitations of modern technology in connection with designers’ creativity. Moreover, the design process pre-sented in this study is expected to contribute to the commercialization and generalization of 3DP by providing practicalhelp to allow fashion experts to utilize 3DP technology.",임소영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108570142

패션 온라인 플랫폼의 AI 알고리즘 가격설정에 대한 가격 공정성 지각,"This study explores the effects of providing information on the price fairness perception and intention of continuous use in an online fashion platform, given a price difference due to AI algorithm pricing. We investigated the moderating roles of price inequality (loss vs. gain) and technology insecurity. The experiments used four stimuli based on price inequality (loss vs. gain) and information provision (provided or not) on price inequality. We developed a mock website and offered a scenario on the product presentation based on an AI algorithm pricing. Participants in their 20s and 30s were randomly allocated to one of the stimuli. To test the hypotheses, a total of 257 responses were analyzed using Process Macro 3.4. According to the results, price fairness perception mediated between information provision and continuous use intention when consumers saw the price inequality as a gain. When the consumers perceived high technology insecurity, information provision affected the intention of continuous use mediated by price fairness perception.",정하억 ( Ha-eok Jeong ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107914131
