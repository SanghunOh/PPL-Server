technology, and whether the experience of using smart and digital devices moderates the effect of science teaching attitude.
Methods: An online survey was conducted targeting 118 teachers with more than 1 year of experience in kindergarten and day care center settings. Descriptive statistical analysis, correlation analysis, and The Process macro model 4, 14 were performed
using SPSS 27.0 and The Process macro 3.5.
Results: First, the science teaching attitude of early childhood teachers served as a mediator between the professional learning environment of institutions and teachers' intention to accept AI technology. Second, the experience of using smart and digital devices was found to moderate the effect of teachers' science teaching attitude on their intention to accept AI technology.
Conclusion/Implications: This results showed that an institutional environment that supports teachers' professionalism development and provides rich experience is crucial for promoting teachers’ active acceptance of AI technology. The findings highlight the importance of creating a supportive institutional envionment for teacher’s professional growth, enhancing science teaching attitudes, and facilitating the use of various devices.",안혜령(Hye-Ryung An),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108560285
양육행동 및 형제관계와 아동의 자존감과의 관계 연구,"The purpose of this study was to investigate how parental childrearing behavior and children`s sibling relationships are related to children`s self-esteem. 440 middle class families consisting of two children and their parents were the subjects of this study. The research instruments included a childrearing behavior questionnaire, the Sibling Relationships Questionnaire (Furman & Buhrmester, 1985), and the Self-Perception Profile for Children (Harter, 1985). Analyses of the data included correlation analysis, canonical correlation, regression, stepwise multiple regression, and MANOVA with stepwise discriminant analysis as the follow-up test. The most powerful predictors of children`s self-esteem were the Warmth-Acceptance of childrearing behavior and the Warmth-Closeness of sibling relationships. The self-esteem dimension was best predicted by parental childrearing behavior and by children`s sibling relationships was Global Self-Worth. Behavioral Conduct was best predicted by the Rejection-Restriction factor of childrearing, and by Conflict (for boys) and Rivalry (for girls) factors of sibling relationships. Children`s self-esteem was related more strongly to the Warmth-Acceptance and the Rejection-Restriction of opposite-sex parents. The effects of PermissivenessNonintervention were stronger in same-sex parent-child dyads. Parental childrearing behaviors accounted for boy`s self-esteem better than girl`s with the exception of Behavioral Conduct. Sibling relationships accounted for girl`s self-esteem better than boy`s. The 2×2 MANOVA revealed interaction effects of parental childrearing behaviors and sibling relationships on children`s self-esteem. Two factors of Rivalry and Conflict in sibling relationships and all three factors of childrearing behaviors showed significant interaction effects, The childrearing factor of Permissiveness-Nonintervention and the sibling factor of Rivalry, which were relatively weak predictors of self-esteem when acting alone, gained power in explaining children`s self-esteem within the interactional context.",박영애(Young Yae Park),1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102953558
교사에 대한 학부모 기대와 인식에 대한 고찰: 선행연구를 중심으로,"This study noted that the conflict between parents and teachers is caused by distrust of each other, which it may arise from due to differences between expectations and perceptions of each other. This study analyzed what parents' expectations and perceptions of school teachers were, focusing on previous studies. The results of the study were as follows. First, teachers expected by parents include ‘teachers who understand the characteristics of students well and satisfy individual needs’, ‘teachers with professional knowledge and skills’, and ‘teachers who communicate with parents in equal and partnership’. Second, teachers perceived by parents include ‘teachers who do not know students well’, ‘teachers who do not help students’, and ‘teachers who want parents' help but dislike to interfere.’ The results indicated that there is a significant gap between parents' expectations and perceptions of teachers. Based on the results, discussion for parent-teacher cooperation and suggestions for future research were presented.",황성희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108208000
유아교육 및 보육 정책 환경과 효과 분석,"The purpose of this study is to examine the policy environments of early childhood education and child care in Finland, the United Kingdom and Japan and to compare and analyze policy effects using the policy web. For this purpose, policy input and output factors were selected and analyzed. The results are summarized as follows: First, in Finland and the UK, the investment ratio of public funds in the infant and childhood period exceeded the OECD average compared with GDP. Second, policies related to companies such as parenting leave system are active in each country. Especially the UK, which has a relatively high expenditure on family welfare, has a higher fertility rate and mother employment rate than the OECD average. Third among the three countries, Finland especially strengthened the family support system which in result affected on the women’s employment and fertility rate exceeding the OECD average. Finally, the UK and Japan have relatively high qualifications standards for teachers compared to other OECD countries and attributed to the higher rate of enrollment of 3 to 5 year old children in kindergarten. Based on these findings, policy implications such as the establishment of stable financial resources to support the Nuri curriculum, arrangement of an effective policy related to companies to promote housework and work compatibility for married couples and its confirmation plan have been suggested for early childhood education and child care in Korea.",장민영,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104383725
부부갈등과 아동의 행동문제,"This study examined the salutary effects of marital conflict resolution on children`s behavior problems. The subjects were 487 4th and 6th grade students and their parents. Data were analyzed by multiple regression analyses of the SAS program. Children`s problem behaviors were positively correlated with their perception of marital conflict. After intervention, children`s perception of the resolution of marital conflict moderated their aggressive or immature behavior. Sex and age differences showed salutary effects of marital conflict resolution on boys` but not girls` behavior problems and on 6th grade students but not 4th grade students.",권영옥(Young Ock Kwon),1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102953819
어머니와 아버지의 온정적 · 통제적 양육행동이 아동의 사회성 및 학업능력에 미치는 종단적 경로: 아동의 집행기능 곤란의 매개 역할,"Objectives: This study examined longitudinal pathways from mothers’ and fathers’ warmth and control to children’s prosocial and externalizing problem behaviors as well as academic outcome. The study also explored whether children’s executive functioning difficulty plays the mediating role in the links between mothers’ and fathers’ parenting behaviors and children’s social and academic outcomes.
Methods: Participants were 1,671 children and their parents which were retrieved from the Panel Study on Korean Children. Direct relations between parenting variables and children’s social and academic outcomes were examined. Indirect effects of children’s executive functioning difficulty were also investigated in these associations. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the longitudinal relations among maternal and paternal parenting behaviors, children’s executive functioning difficulty, and their social and academic outcomes. The bootstrapping method was also used to examine the indirect effects of children’s executive functioning difficulty in the links between parenting variables and children’s social and academic outcomes.
Results: Mothers' and fathers' warm parenting was negatively related to children’s executive functioning difficulty, which in turn predicted their subsequent prosocial and externalizing problem behaviors, as well as academic outcome. Moreover, indirect relations between parenting variables and children’s social and academic outcomes via children’s executive functioning difficulty were found.
Conclusion: The result of this study suggests the importance of parental warmth in children's social and academic outcomes. The present results also emphasize the role of children’s executive functioning difficulty as the pivotal mechanism that explains how mothers’ and fathers’ warm parenting predicts subsequent children’s outcomes in social and academic domains.",한영숙,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244618
영아 자녀를 둔 어머니의 양육스트레스 변화가 온정적 양육행동 및 유아의 사회정서발달에 미치는 영향,"Objective: This study aimed to investigate the trajectory of maternal parenting stress during infancy according to the employment status of mothers when each year`s depression was controlled and examine the longitudinal effects of parenting stress on affective parenting and socioemotional developmental outcomes for preschoolers. Methods: Using latent growth modeling, the first 4 waves of panel data collected from 2,078 mothers and their babies were analyzed. This nationwide data was provided from the 2008 Panel Study on Korean Children, conducted by the Korea Institute of Child Care and Education. Results: First, maternal parenting stress showed a linear increasing pattern, and there were individual differences in intercept and slope. Second, when each year`s maternal depression was controlled, the intercept of parenting stress was lower, but the rate of increase was higher. In multiple group analyses, this increasing pattern of parenting stress was significant only in unemployed mothers. Lastly, the increase of unemployed mothers` parenting stress had direct effects on child emotionality and peer interaction and had an indirect effect on child peer interaction (mediated by affective parenting). Conclusion: The current study verified that the longitudinal effects of increasing parenting stress of unemployed mothers on affective parenting and child socioemotional development when maternal depression level was controlled. These results imply that we need to pay more attention to emotional health and resources of unemployed mothers and provide them with social support as well as employed mothers.",박새롬(Saerom Park),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102954833

2019 개정 누리과정 놀이실행자료에 기초한 유아교사용 놀이지원 척도 개발,"Objective: The goal of this study is to develop an instrument for measuring the quality of teacher support for children's play (age 3-5) based on the Play Practice Resources for Teachers presented in the 2019 revised Nuri Curriculum.
Methods: The subjects of this study were 333 early childhood educators. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, as well as correlation analysis were all performed to confirm construct validity and concurrent validity. The reliability of each factor was verified using Cronbach’s alpha.
Results: The Preschool Teacher Play Support Scale (PTPSS) was finalized with 25 items, which included the following four sub-factors: interaction, play materials, play space, and play safety. The concurrent validity was also confirmed through significant correlations between the existing measures such as the Teacher Self-Efficacy Scale, the Teaching Efficacy Scale for Play, and the Teacher-Toddler Interaction Scale. The reliability of each factor was also desirable.
Conclusion/Implications: The PTPSS was verified as a sound measure quantifying the play support behavior of teachers who respect the autonomy and initiative of young children which is being pursued by the 2019 revised Nuri Curriculum.",성안나,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108108740
"어머니의 양육 스트레스 , 사회적 지원과 부모효능감이 양육행동에 미치는 영향","The purpose of this study was to investigate causal relationships among parenting stress, social support, parenting efficacy, and mothers` parenting behaviors as a function of child`s sex. The subjects were 419 boys and 414 girls in the 3rd grade of elementary schools in Inchon city, and their mothers. Conflict Tactics Scales (Straus, 1979), Parenting Stress Index (Abidin, 1990), and Parenting Sense of Competence (Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978) were revised for use in this research. A modified version of the Social Support Scale (Pak, 1985) and Teamwork of Parenting Alliance Inventory (Abidin, 1988) were used. The data were analyzed with one way ANOVAS, Pearson`s correlations, and covariance structural analysis by the LISREL 8.03 program. The results of this study were: (1) The more mothers felt parenting stress and the less they perceived social support and parenting efficacy. (2) The process leading to mothers` coercive parenting behaviors differed as a function of child`s sex. For mothers of boys, parenting stress and social support had an indirect effect on coercive parenting behaviors through the mediation of parenting efficacy. For mothers of girls, however, parenting stress had a direct effect on coercive parenting behaviors.",신숙재(Suk Jea Shin),1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102953530
부모공동양육과 유아의 정서 조절이 유아의 외현화 문제행동에 미치는 영향,"Objectives: The main purpose of this study was to examine the direct and indirect effects of co-parenting, infants’ emotional self-control, and infants’ externalized problem behaviors.
Methods: A total of 281 mothers of infants aged 3-5 years responded to questionnaires on three research variables. The scale used in this study was first measured using a co-parenting questionnaire, the emotional regulation checklist (ECR), and the child behavior checklist (CBCL). Data were analyzed with structural equation modeling using SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 20.0.
Results: The correlations between co-parenting, infants’ emotional self-control, and externalized problem behaviors were all statistically significant. With regard to the direct impact of co-parenting on infant problem behavior, co-parenting had a significant impact on infant externalized problem behavior. Co-parenting also indirectly influenced the externalized problem behaviors in infants through the infants’ emotional self-control.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated the importance of co-parenting and infant’s emotional self-control. The results suggest the need for a parent education program to improve infants’ emotional self-control and could be used as basic data for counseling and parent education sites to develop parenting programs to prevent infant problem behavior and ultimately create an enviroment that positively affects infant development.",유다정(Dajoung Yoo),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108151560
유아기 모-자녀 상호작용이 아동의 친사회적 행동과 행동문제에 미치는 종단적 영향에서 아동의 자아존중감의 매개효과,"Objectives: This study aims to examine the longitudinal effects of mother-preschooler interaction on a child’s prosocial behavior and behavior problem. Furthermore, it examines the mediating role of child’s self-esteem between mother-preschooler interaction and child’s prosocial behavior and behavior problem.
Methods: The participants were 882 children(452 boys and 430 girls) and their mothers from the 7th(T1) to 9th(T3) wave(2014~2016) of the Panel Study on Korean Children. Data were analyzed with a Structural Equation Model and a bootstrapping method was used to test the statistical significance of the mediation.
Results: First, the mother-preschooler interaction did not have a direct longitudinal effect on a child’s prosocial behavior, but had an indirect effect through self-esteem after controlling gender. The bootstrapping result suggested that the indirect effect is statistically significant. Second, motherpreschooler interaction did not have longitudinal effects on behavior problem, both directly and indirectly, through child’s self-esteem. Consequently, the more the interaction between mothers and preschoolers, the higher the child’s self-esteem, which led to a higher prosocial behavior.
Conclusion: The results of this study show the mediating effect of self-esteem on the relationship between mother-preschooler interaction and child’s prosocial behavior. These findings suggest that parents should provide children with experiences in various interactions. They also imply the importance of experience in interactions in meaningful social relations for positive behavior of children. These experiences could play a role improving confidence in one’s worth and, eventually, allow children to have positive behaviors in social relations. The limitations and other implications of this study are also discussed.",최혜선,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244616

어린이집 유아반의 안전사고 발생과 사후조치의 현황 및 정책적 시사점,"The study involved an online survey of 265 teachers in childcare centers and examined the frequency and characteristics of preschoolers’ safety accidents and teachers’ response practices. Descriptive statistics examined the occurrence of safety accidents, characteristics of safety accidents, and response practices. To examine the differences between groups based on the overall background in the number of safety accidents, T-test and ANOVA analyses were used. The findings indicated that approximately three-quarters of the safety accidents occurred in the classroom over the two-week study period. Major accidents included falls and bumps; which occurred during free play time inside the classroom and could be attributed to the child's negligence and personality traits. Furthermore, 50.2% of the safety accidents involved two or more types of injuries. About 60.6% of the safety accidents were attended by childcare personnel and only 13.7% sought compensation from the Childcare Center Safety & Insurance Association (CSIA), indicating that most of the accidents were relatively minor. The results offer suggestions for policies to distinguish between preventable incidents and unforeseen accidents and to consider children’s characteristics, which are the main causes of safety accidents.",신나리,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108280494
"3 , 4 , 5세 아동의 구성놀이 발달에 관한 연구","The purpose of this study was to analyze the quality of the constructive play of 3, 4 and 5 year-old children. The researchers used unit blocks as the instrument because they are the most representative examples of constructive play materials. The subjects were 73 children enrolled in a half-day early childhood education program. The children`s block play was videotaped 8 times, for a total of 330 minutes. The videotapes were transcribed and assessments were made on the children`s 233 constructions in terms of the developmental stage of block play, the variety of materials used, play duration, and play intensity. The data were analyzed through two-way ANOVA to check age and sex differences. The results showed that children`s developmental stages of block play were low on the average and that girls did not show an active interest in block play. The results also implied that block play developed by play experience rather than by age. Therefore, this study was interpreted to highlight the importance of teachers` understanding, planning, and mediation of block play in order to induce high-quality constructive play.",구현아(Hyun Ah Koo),1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102953538
"어린이집 조직혁신성, 영유아교사의 디지털 리터러시, 테크노스트레스와 교사효능감 간의 구조적 관계 분석","Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the structural relationship among child care center innovativeness, the early childhood(EC) teacher’s digital literacy(DL), technostress and teacher efficacy. Methods: The participants were 454 EC teachers and were selected only if they had worked for more than one year. The innovativeness of childcare centers, the teacher’s DL, technostress, and teacher efficacy were assessed through online self-report questionaries. Data were analyzed through ANOVA, t-test, and SEM. Results: First, DL and technostress of EC teachers differed in some ways depending on the teacher's demographic background, the characteristics of their working institution, and their educational level of digital skills. Second, the childcare center innovativeness directly had a significant positive effect on DL, technostress, and efficacy of the teachers. In addition, the effect of the innovativeness on teacher efficacy was mediated by DL and technostress of the teachers. Conclusion/Implications: The more efforts made of childcare centers for recognizing the rapid development of DL and trying to change, the better the teacher's scores of DL and the appropriate technostress were, which increases teacher efficacy. So, continuous training and education for teachers with consideration of age and teaching experience, as well as public aid to improve teachers’ DL skills are required.",김윤지(Yoon Ji Kim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108489099

It also explored the moderated moderation effect of motherchild communication and children’s gender on the relationship between maternal mediation and children’s smartphone overdependence.
Methods: A total of 411 first to third grade elementary school students and their mothers participated in this study. Mothers responded to questionnaires. Data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis with SPSS 21.0 and using model 3 in PROCESS macro version 3.4.
Results: First, maternal active mediation only affected girls’ smartphone overdependence, while maternal restrictive mediation affected both boys’ and girls’ smartphone overdependence. That is, the more active mediation mothers showed, the less dependent girls were on smartphones. Moreover, the more restrictive mediation mothers showed, the less dependent both boys and girls were on smartphones. Second, problematic communication influenced both boys’ and girls’ smartphone overdependence; that is, the more problematic communication they had with their mothers, the more they depended on smartphones. Lastly, the effect of maternal active mediation on children’s smartphone overdependence was different depending on open communication and children’s gender.
Specifically, its effect on children’s smartphone overdependence was greater when they communicated more openly with their mothers, and this effect was only found in the case of girls.
Conclusion: This study confirmed that maternal mediation and mother-child communication are important to effectively prevent or intervene in children’s smartphone overdependence. It also suggests that prevention or intervention should be approached differently depending on children’s gender.",박보경,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244619
학령 초기 아동의 스마트폰 과의존이 문제행동에 미치는 영향: 수면문제의 매개효과,"Objectives: This study explored the relationship between early elementary school children’s smartphone overdependence, sleep problems, and problem behaviors. Specifically, it examined the direct effect of children’s smartphone overdependence on problem behaviors and the indirect effect of their smartphone overdependence on problem behaviors through sleep problems.
Methods: About 283 mothers rearing first to third grade elementary school children (135 boys and 148 girls) answered questionnaires on their children’s smartphone overdependence, sleep problems, and problem behaviors. The Model 4 of PROCESS macro version 3.4 was used for data analysis.
Results: First, children’s smartphone overdependence had a positive effect on their internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Children who were highly dependent on smartphones exhibited more internalizing or externalizing problem behaviors. Second, children’s smartphone overdependence had a positive effect on sleep problems, which in turn had a positive effect on internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. Children who were highly dependent on smartphones experienced more sleep problems, which increased their internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors.
Conclusion: Sleep problems mediated the relationship between smartphone overdependence and problem behaviors among early elementary school children, who have not received adequate attention from researchers. The results are meaningful because they confirm the underlying mechanism through which children’s smartphone overdependence impacts their problem behaviors. These results can be used to prevent children’s problem behaviors or reduce their sleep problems by parents rearing early elementary school children or experts providing parent education.",박보경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108731531

"어머니의 스마트미디어 리터러시, 스마트미디어 중재, 유아의 스마트기기 과의존과 실행기능 간의 구조적 관계","Objectives: This study aimed to examine the structural relationships among mothers’ smart media literacy, smart media mediation, young children’s overdependence on smart devices, and executive function.
Methods: The Participants comprised 205 children aged 3 to 5 years old, and their mothers. The Early Years Toolbox (EYT) was used to measure young children’s executive function. The data obtained were analyzed using Cronbach’s α, frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA analysis, and partial correlation analysis with SPSS 25.0. Bootstrapping was used to examine the mediating effect while the Structural Equation Model (SEM) analysis was performed using AMOS 22.0.
Results: First, young children’s executive function was positively associated with mothers’ smart media literacy and smart media mediation but negatively associated with young children’s overdependence on smart devices. Second, mothers’ smart media mediation and young children’s overdependence on smart devices sequentially mediated the relationship between mothers’ smart media literacy and young children’s executive function. It was also found that mothers’ smart media mediation partially mediated the relationship between mothers’ smart media literacy and young children’s executive function.
Conclusion: These findings highlight the importance of mothers’ smart media literacy and smart media mediation for young children’s executive function and emphasize the need of prevention for overdependence on smart devices in facilitating executive function development in early childhood.",이수빈,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244615

After 3 years, attachment security was assessed using Attachment Q-Set, and the modified IPBI (Iowa Parent Behavior Inventory: Mother Form) was administered to mothers to assess their parenting behavior. Analyses revealed significant differences in children`s attachment security scores by infancy attachment patterns. That is 11 of 12 children`s attachment to mothers qualities were stable across the 3 year periods. The attachment security scores related positively to the responsive maternal parenting behavior. Changes in child-mother attachment quality over time were related to maternal responsiveness.

Methods: The study participants included 309 fathers of children aged from 3 to 5 years. Data were analyzed using models of the PROCESS Macro. Results: As a result of this research, the relationship of the father’s rough-and-tough play with the child’s adaptive emotional regulation was that this was indeed mediated by the child’s negative emotional expressiveness. Additionally, the father’s responsive and fun play attitude moderated the relationship between the father’s rough-and-tough play and the child’s adaptive emotional regulation. Further, the father’s responsive and fun play attitude according to level had a moderated mediation effect. Conclusion/Implications: These results are meaningful in that they derives a mechanism for why and how a father’s rough-and-tough play affects children's adaptive emotional regulation.",오지현(Jihyun Oh),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108489097
어머니의 아동기 과보호 경험과 부정적 양육행동의 관계에서 어머니의 자기분화를 통한 부모성찰의 조절된 매개효과,"Objectives: This study aims to determine how mothers’ parenting experiences affect their attitudes toward raising children. Specifically, it examines how the experience of being raised by overprotective parents affects a mother’s parenting behavior and analyzes the structural relationship and impact of self-differentiation and parental reflection variables on the relationship between the two variables.
Methods: The study participants were mothers of infants found through children's institutions located in Gwangju and Jeollanam-do. The institutions had been selected randomly and consent was obtained from all participants. A total of 374 questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro.
Results: First, it was confirmed that self-differentiation completely mediated the relationship between mothers’ childhood overprotection experience and mothers’ negative parenting behavior through selfdifferentiation. Second, it was confirmed that parental reflection regulates the relationship between mothers’ childhood overprotection experience and self-differentiation. Third, the statistical significance of the controlled mediating effect of parental reflection was confirmed in the path in which the mother's childhood overprotection affected parenting behavior through self-differentiation. This suggests that, even if the mother was overprotected as a child and has a low level of selfdifferentiation, enhancing parental reflection can reduce negative parenting behaior.
Conclusion: This study is meaningful in that it discovered the possibility of modifying the process of negative parenting behavior between generations through the parental reflection function. In addition, the fundamental limitations of the previous parental education were revised and suggestions were made for the development of parental education programs that involve the parental reflection functions.",강서로,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244614
"초저출산 시대, 전국민 부모급여 제도의 설계","This study examines the need to introduce a national parental benefit system in order to tackle the falling birth rate in Korea. The aim of the study is to design and present a ‘National Parental Benefit System (NPBS)’, which will be modelled on the similar systems in other parts of the world. Korea has been responding passively to the problem of “double cost,” an outcome of loss of income due to lack of parental leave and increase in household expenditure owing to childcare. We benchmark Germany's 'Parents Allowance System', that provides income-related benefits to all citizens through general finance, as well as Sweden's 'Parental Insurance,' that provides sufficient benefits to the middle class through social insurance and eliminates blind spots through general finance. The proposed NPBS would provide a monthly flat-rate benefit of one million won from general finance to all parents of child birth. Additionally an income-related benefit (replacement rate of 30%, upper limit of 2 million won) to (parent) insurance subscribers, which reaches a maximum of 3 million won per month in total. To finance the NPBS, it is proposed to increase the value-added tax rate (0.5%p) and to pay 0.4% of the wage as a (parent) insurance premium (employers and workers pay 1/2 each).",양재진,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107951428

부모의 심리적 통제가 남녀 아동의 관계적 공격성에 미치는 영향과 거부민감성의 매개효과,"Objective: This study examined the influences of maternal and paternal psychological control and children’s rejection sensitivity on relational aggression in elementary school students, and investigated whether children’s rejection sensitivity mediated the relation of parental psychological control and relational aggression. Methods: The participants of this study were 596 fifth to sixth graders from seven elementary schools located in Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi province. To measure the research variables, the Peer Conflict Scale (Marsee, Kimonis, & Frick, 2004), the Psychological Control Scale (Barber, 1996) and the Children’s Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (Downey, Lebolt, Rincon, & Freitas, 1998) were used. The data were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics and t -tests. Also, structure equation model (SEM) were used to examine the mediating role of rejection sensitivity. Results: The results of this study were as follows. First, the level of paternal psychological control increased the level of children’s relational aggression whereas the level of maternal psychological control had no significant effect on it. In addition, the level of rejection sensitivity had a significant positive influence on the level of relational aggression. These tendencies were observed on both boys and girls. Second, only for boys, rejection sensitivity in upper elementary school students partially mediated the relation between paternal psychological control and relational aggression. Also, for both boys and girls, rejection sensitivity completely mediated the relation between maternal psychological control and relational aggression. Conclusion: In conclusion, the higher the level of paternal psychological control, the higher the level of children’s rejection sensitivity, and subsequently the higher the level of their relational aggression",이경미(Kyung Mi Lee),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102954701
"만 1세 영아의 맞벌이 부모 동반참여 블렌디드러닝 부모교육 프로그램의 개발 및 효과: 부모의 언어적 행동, 반응성 및 공동양육을 중심으로","Objectives: This study aimed to develop a blended learning-based parenting program and examine its effects on the quality of verbal behavior, responsiveness, and co-parenting of working parents with one-year-old infants.
Methods: Since both parents were working, the ‘Blended Learning’ method, which integrates online and offline sessions, was used. To evaluate the effectiveness of the developed program, 43 pairs of working parents, each having a one-year-old child were recruited (24 pairs in the experimental groups and 19 pairs in the control group). Parental verbal behaviors, responsiveness, and co-parenting were assessed before and after the eight-week program. The data were analyzed with ANCOVA using the pretest score as a covariate.
Results: The parenting program was developed through the following five steps derived from the ADDIE model development process: analyzing, designing, developing, implementing, evaluating. The program lasts for eight weeks and consists of four offline and eight online training sessions. After participating in the program, the parents in the experimental group showed improvement in their verbal behaviors and responsiveness during play interactions. There was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group on the co-parenting assessment scores.
Conclusion: The blended learning-based parenting program proved to be effective in improving the quality of working parents’ verbal behaviors and responsiveness.",신혜영(Hye Young Shin),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107409853
사회적 자본의 관점에서 본 조손가족 조부모의 양육문제 해결방안,"The purpose of this study is to examine the solutions to the nurturing problem of grandparents in grandparents-grandchildren families through the perspective of social capital, using literature analysis. This study operated the descriptive analysis and contents analysis according to the research themes and methods. The results of this study showed that the nurturing problem of grandparents in grandparents-grandchildren families had been actively discussed since 2003, and there were a lot of research on the nurturing experience. Quantitative research methodology was mainly used in the beginning, but the usage of qualitative research methodology has been increased rapidly since 2006. Mixed research was used a lot in the literature suggesting policies. In addition, there was a communication problem between grandparents and grandchildren resulting from a generation gap, and the relationship between grandparents and grandchildren was the dominant cause of the nurturing stress of grandparents. In particular, the nurturing stress of grandparents as daily stress negatively affected grandchildren's adaptation to school as well as grandparents’ physical and psychological health. Therefore, in order to solve the nurturing problem of grandparents, it is necessary to improve the quality of interaction between grandparents and grandchildren by diversifying the contents and forms of communication. In the end, this study suggests the methods that grandparents are able to use in order to solve the nurturing problem, by showing the reality of social networking including parents meeting or self-help group.",김승희,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101896537
어린이집내 인공지능 로봇 사용경험 여부에 따른 유아의 인공지능 인식 차이,"Objective: This study investigated the differences in preschool children’s perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) and their distribution by latent profiles according to their experience with AI robots in daycare centers.
Methods: The participants included 119 five-year-old children, 52 of whom had experience with AI robots in daycare centers and 67 of whom did not. Children’s perceptions of AI were measured using the Godspeed scale from Bartneck et al.(2009). Data were analyzed using a t-test, latent profile analysis, and chi-square test.
Results: The results showed that compared to the inexperienced group, the experienced group reported lower levels of animacy and perceived intelligence of AI robots, indicating higher levels of AI knowledge and understanding. In addition, the experienced
group had a higher probability of belonging to the ‘machine recognition’ type than ‘organism recognition’ type, although the difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusion/Implications: The findings suggest that experience with AI robots in daycare centers can improve children’s AI knowledge and understanding. To further enhance this effect, it is necessary to increase the number of robots put into classrooms, and to consider various teaching media that reflect children’s preferences.",이보람(Boram Lee),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108560284
