The key findings are as follow: First, there is no difference in residential environment satisfaction among living areas (cities and rural areas). Although urban residents’ satisfaction (5.56 out of 10) is higher than that of rural residents (5.47), it is not statistically significant. Second, according to the results of the analysis by residential environment factors, urban residents are more satisfied with the access to living facilities, while rural residents are more satisfied with the air, noise, and green areas. Third, depending on the living area of young one-person households, urban residents’ intention of the residential movement is higher than that of rural residents. Fourth, the analysis on the factor that affects the satisfaction of the residential environment shows that all four types of housing factors have a statistically significant positive effect. In particular, convenience facility factors have a greater impact than other factors, which are common in urban and rural areas. Fifth, as the result of analyzing the determinants of the intention to move around, urban residents are not greatly affected by certain factors, and rural residents are greatly influenced by cultural tourism and sports factors. Young one-person households are very important for maintaining urban vitality and strengthening residential stability. In particular, considering the high cost of housing for young people, various housing policies in the supply-side for young people and the maintenance of the residential environment that can attract young people are required.","임준홍(Im, Jun-hong)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107355549

The majority of Singaporeans live in public housing provided by the Housing and Development Board(HDB). HDB provides not only housing but also various housing welfare services. The purpose of this research is to examine the various elderly housing welfare services in Singapore and draw conclusion by comparing them to Korea. The elderly housing welfare services in Singapore were analyzed in the aspects of financial, physical, and life/welfare services, which are key aspects of housing welfare services, and those services were analyzed by comparing to Korean services. The research was conducted through a literature review, with supplementary consultation of local experts. As a result, it was found that Singapore is focusing on financial services for the elderly to live independently without financial difficulties. In addition, some benefits were provided for the people to live with or near their parents. These can help reduce the national and social burden of supporting the elderly, as well as the elderly can age in place where they have lived.

The analysis data used the micro-data of Korea housing survey 2020, and the older adults household owners aged 65 or older who responded that they had experience in housing modification were targeted. As a result, older adults households of 'female and 'over 85 years of age' were found to be the most in need of support as both the awareness and use rate of home modification installation and housing support programs were lower than others. As the age increases, the proportion of home modification experience grows. Depending on whether or not there was a disability, older adults households with disabilities had a higher rate of home modification experience, but among them, 'non-registered disabled' households. Most of the home modification items were repaired in the kitchen and toilet- related facilities, 'lever-type faucet (faucet)', and 'a kitchen workbench of appropriate height' was the highest in order. On the other hand, 'emergency bells in the house' and 'auxiliary chair on the porch' showed the lowest rate. The necessary home modification was 'safe flooring for anti- slip', 'a toilet or bathroom support handles', 'emergency bells in the house', and 'removal of steps such as thresholds and stairs in the house' were higher than others.

The purpose of this study is to provide the basic data on the efficient management of community facilities in apartments and operation methods that can enhance residents satisfaction. The following four conclusions are extracted; First, the satisfaction with community operation management is highly correlated with overall satisfaction with community facilities. That is, it can be inferred that the satisfaction level of community facilities not only works in the physical environment but also in software such as operational management. Second, when choosing the operational management method for each facility, the first consideration should be focused on qualitative aspects such as the continuity and level of management of the operation rather than the operational cost. Third, the preference for pure autonomy and consignment methods is very high in the preference survey for residents operational management methods. However, it is assumed that there is a lack of information and understanding on professional and external consignment management methods such as consignment operation and rental operation. Fourth, most rental apartments have the right to decide on many operations and management, including the community, by the Korea Land and Housing Corporation. As a result, it is difficult to reflect the opinions of residents of rental apartments, which are operated independently by the consignment management team.","김민규(Kim, Min-Gyu)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107769720

The percentage of the elderly who live in their own housing marks 73.8%, however, they live in old housing and have low income. The elderly who live in rental housing also live in poor conditions of housing, income, and asset. Despite Korean government's efforts to develop policies and establish systems to provide the housing welfare for the elderly, the results have not been very successful. In order to improve housing welfare for the elderly, the following suggestions were made. First, more collaborative partnerships need to be established between government and nongovernment organizations. Second, provision of affordable residential facilities for the elderly should be expanded in the public sector.

As popularity is increasing, especially among young people who actively want to accept a new lifestyle, various programs that share the interests and hobbies of young people are emerging. Although it has not been established as a major housing type in Korea, it is predicted that the proportion of shared housing will increase and become one housing type based on the declining birthrate and aging society and the increase in single-person households. Therefore, this study aims to propose a youth-type shared housing that introduces an eco-friendly smart farm program that responds to climate change beyond simply sharing space, leisure, and hobby activities. In the study, the direction of development was presented in terms of space, activity, and function of youth-type shared housing applied with smart farms. Smart farms, which can be grown indoors and outdoors, can be linked to spaces where various activities take place in the youth’s lifestyle. Temporary single activities that have been carried out so far can develop into sustainable activities. The application of smart farms in shared housing can save energy in shared housing through the functional advantages of smart farms.

In addition, by identifying the increase in the rent burden compared to the sales along with the decrease in the commercial store sales due to the corona virus, as the business owners and tenants, it proved the need for differential support for commercial stores. In addition, as the commercial store is the subject of the business proposal, it is argued that it is necessary to disperse the pain suffered by the commercial store owner (tenant) by inducing the commercial store lessor to participate in sanctions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.","조영식(Cho, Young Sik)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107867748
노인의 지역사회 계속 거주를 위한 주거복지 정책 방향에 관한 연구,"This study aims to analyze variables that affect the elderly who are willing to live in the house where they currently live and propose the direction of the elderly housing welfare policy. As a result of the analysis, even if the movement is inconvenient, variables that affect the intention to live in the house currently living while receiving home services vary by age group. It can be seen that the longer the period of residence for those in their 60s, the more likely they are to choose to live in the house they want to live in if they are elderly people who do not engage in sports activities. Those in their 70s were more willing to live in the house they currently want to live in as long as the period of residence is longer, and as they do not engage in social and sports activities. Finally, those in their 80s and older were more willing to live in the house they wanted to live in as they received home-based services. If the elderly who are engaged in social leisure activities become uncomfortable to move, the probability of choosing a nursing facility for the elderly is relatively high. On the other hand, the longer the residence period, the more passive the activity, the lower the income, and the poor health condition, the higher the probability of wanting to live in the house they want to live in if they become uncomfortable. Therefore, it is desirable to create an environment for active elderly people to live in a community through housing supply for the elderly. Rather passive elderly people need to provide services in a familiar environment, and if there is a residential shift, they need to provide a familiar environment that is behaviorally and emotionally meaningful as the core of the process of creating a new environment and making a house again.","서종녀(Seo, Jong-Nyeo)",2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108605740

The degree to which residents are satisfied with residential conditions is measured as 3.16 out of 5 points and affected obviously by a convenient facility and job-related factor. According to the results on intention to migrate to Naepo, 26.0% of respondents wanted to move and the most influential factors for migration were summarized as (i) convenient facilities and job, (ii) safety and cleanliness, and (iii) disaster. Thus, dissatisfaction with respect to physical, psychological, and safety perspectives works as a key reason for residents to leave. It is expected to be deepened after COVID-19.
Especially, people who are in their thirties or forties or college-educated, work in government offices, white-collar or professional jobs, or have higher income are more likely to move to Naepo. That is, relatively young and elite people tend to leave, and thus the area would lose its vitality.
In order to improve residential environments with help of local government which is unfortunately limited in finance, it is necessary to link the central government’s project of supplying living SOC. In addition, it is required to supply living SOC which is multi-purposed with various functions because both population and the demand are decreasing in rural areas.","임준홍(Im, Jun-hong)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107211847

In addition, the highest satisfaction was obtained for (2)tenure mixed housing complex which rental and sale are located in the same building, followed by (3)tenure mixed housing complex but rental and sale are not located in the same building and (1)rental-only housing complex. This suggests that tenure mixed housing is solving the problems caused by the social exclusion phenomenon and the spatial separation of the residential areas with different income levels. Meanwhile, it seems that public efforts will be needed for the satisfaction of the accessibility and convenience, and the social environment for residents of the tenure mixed complex.",오정석,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105967486
대구 쪽방촌 주거환경실태 조사 및 열환경 분석 연구,"A Jjok-bang is a subdivided rental housing unit inhabited by low-income residents. Each renter occupies a single small room and must share bathroom and kitchen facilities with other residents. These vulnerable individuals struggle with both housing and energy poverty and are often on the verge of homelessness. Jjok-bang houses are typically old buildings that do not have proper heating, cooling, insulation, or ventilation systems, so it is necessary to develop a welfare program to advocate for Jjok-bang residents who are vulnerable to the dangers posed by substandard housing environments. In this study, a thermal environment measurement and an interview survey of Jjok-bang residents were conducted and result of thermal vulnerability assessment based on PMV method were presented. Of the surveyed residents, 87.7% were either unemployed or day laborers living in Jjok-bang due to financial difficulties. The house surveyed was an old building that had been constructed more than 40 years ago and was poorly insulated. The results of indoor thermal environment measurements and PMV analysis showed that neither winter nor summer living conditions satisfied the minimum housing standards suggested by domestic and international guidelines.","유원택(Ryu, Wontaek)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107953215
코로나19 발생에 따른 청년 1인가구의 주생활행위 변화,"With the aim of identifying changes in the housing behavior of young single-person households before and after the outbreak of COVID-19, this study analyzed 133 Internet articles published from January to December before the COVID-19 crisis for a comparison with preceding studies on the housing behavior of young single-person households after the pandemic began. In addition, in order to closely examine the actual behavior changes in young households in connection with the results of the article analysis, interviews were conducted with 10 young single-person households on the changes in their housing behavior before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. The article analysis led to the observation that more articles about hobby and home decoration were published after the crisis. The interview results show, consistent with the article analysis results, an increasing trend of hobby activities, along with a marked increase in activities related to telecommuting, online classes and eating (specifically in relation to delivery meals). The results of this study provide a glimpse of the changes in the housing behavior of young single-person households before and after the pandemic, and are expected to be used as basic data for planning youth housing suitable for the post-corona era.","김태완(Kim, Tae-Wan)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107953213
동시출현단어 분석을 이용한 노인주거디자인 국내외 연구동향 비교 - Web of Science Core Collection과 KCI-Korean 저널 데이터베이스를 중심으로 -,"In aging society, providing comfortable and optimized residential environment for the elderly is essential task for policy makers, designers, and researchers. The purpose of this research was to identify research trends in housing design for the elderly, both domestically in South Korea and in international, in order to propose a future research and a strategy for the research community. For this goal, we analyzed research documents published in domestic and international journal articles retrieved from Web of Science databases, using VOSviewer software for keyword co-occurrence analysis. The results show that international studies categorized as follows: (a) systems, services, and technologies, (b) care and health, (c) illness and life of the elderly (dementia, depression, etc.), and (d) macroperspective (population, project, government, and public-private partnership); domestic studies were categorized as (a) characteristics of residential environment, (b) studies on elderly care facilities, (c) architecture and interior design for the elderly, and (d) user needs and design elements. Compared to international research trends, those of domestic research tended to lack convergence of diverse areas and interest; thus, expansion of research interest towards more diverse disciplines including technology, health, medicine, nursing, and policy is necessary. The results provide insights for the direction of future research on the aging society of South Korea.","왕택우(Wang, Ze-Yu)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107953210
정비지원계획구역 지정이 부동산 가격에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구-서울시 용산구 청파동1가를 중심으로-,"This study investigated the impact of the maintenance support plan system introduced in September 2021 on real estate prices for rapid housing supply in Seoul. In particular, while designating the maintenance support plan area, the land transaction permit system and the base date for calculating rights were designated for the purpose of preventing the rise in real estate prices, and the impact of these policies on real estate prices was analyzed. Based on the actual transaction price, this study confirmed whether real estate prices were stabilized using a double-difference method that measures policy effects before and after the public offering by dividing into groups that applied real estate regulations and groups that did not. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there was no effect of suppressing the rise in real estate prices due to the application of the land transaction permit system to stabilize housing prices and the base date for calculating rights. Therefore, based on the results of this study, it is necessary to prepare additional measures to block speculative demand when designating a future maintenance support plan.",김숙현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108766881
외부환경과의 교류와 소통을 위한 매개공간 특성 - 주거유닛의 발코니 공간을 중심으로 -,"Due to Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, people have experienced imbalance between the inside and outside and become aware of personal and social relationship based on places. Place as a meaningful location should provide a connection between the inside and the outside and provide a smooth transition between inside and outside. Balcony areas became used as living areas for replacement of its transitional functions as intended. More diverse shape and layout, size can provide higher possibility of connection and communication toward outside of individual unit in multi-complex housing in urban settings. For this study, we collected some of foreign and domestic balcony cases and analyzed layout arrangement, size, shape, and degree of openness. Foreign social housing appeared to have more diverse shapes and size variations and provided more open spaces with higher possibility of connection and communication with outside. In many domestic cases, balconies are more disconnected, enclosed and secured increased privacy.","이소영(Lee, So-Young)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107952642
"공유주거, 청년 1인가구의 주거 대안이 될 수 있는가?: 주거 유형별 사회적자본 및 주거만족도 비교·분석 연구","As urbanization and household differentiation progressed, Co-housing begans to emerge as an alternative to modern housing that pursues economic and socio-cultural benefits through the community. Co-housing is recognized as a desirable housing alternative for community revitalization at a time when exchanges between people are decreasing and community attachment, including social capital, is decreasing. Co-housing is advantageous in that it can secure high-quality residential spaces by operating various shared spaces compared to limited housing costs, and can independently form and exchange communities focusing on studies, work, and interests. This study started with the question of the utility and sustainability of Co-housing as an alternative housing type for single-person youth households. It is intended to verify the utility of Co-housing and to derive detailed housing factors that can improve the housing satisfaction of single-person households by analyzing whether they can lead a qualitative residential environment rather than living in detached house.","서은지(Seo, Eun-ji)",2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108112400

입원 신생아에 있어 환경 온·습도에 따른 체온변이,"A cross sectional explorative study was conducted to invest the relationship between the temperature and humidity of the environment that newborns were l℃ated at and the central and peripheral body temperatures of newborns in hospitalized newborns using a primary dataset on 199 high-risk infants. Data was collected on the temperature (℃) and humidity (%) of the environments (incubator, radiant warmer and room), the temperatures (℃) from the central part (right upper quadrant of abdominal surface) and the peripheral part (dorsal surface of hand) of newborns. As well the weight and length was deducted from main dataset with general characteristics of newborns. The result showed that all of newborn revealed the peripheral hypothermia regardless of 88% of them in normothermia, 9% in hypothermia and 3% in hyperthermia. The low humidity of the environment, rather than the low environmental temperature of either incubator or radiant warmer, was mainly responsible for the massive peripheral hypothermia. Proper environmental humidity should be provided to maintain the normothermia of entire body system in high-risk newborns at NICU.",이상미(Sang-Mi Lee),2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99590470
