
간호학생이 임상실습시 느끼는 스트레스와 자기표현행동 및 간호수행정도에 영향을 미치는 요인,"This study was designed to identify influencing factors on assertiveness, clinical stress and nursing performance in nursing students.
The data was collected through structured questionairs from May 8 to May 23, 2000. The subjects in this study were 114 nursing students who had been practiced in a Hospital in Kwangju
The data was analyzed by using SPSS PC program.
The results from this study were as follows;
1. The assertiveness of nursing students was significantly realted to grades of students (F=2.751, p=.046), satisfaction of cilnical practice (F=4.742, p=.011) and satisfaction of nursing(t=2.262, p=.026).
2. Clinical stress of nursing students was significantly related to grades of students (F=6.145, p=.001) and satisfaction of nursing(t=3.148, p=.002).
3. Nursing performance of nursing students was significantly related to grades of students(F=4.320, p=.006) and satisfaction of nursing(t=2.141, p=.034).
4. In the correlations, assertiveness of nursing students was positive correlations with nursing performance(r=.263, p=.005), clinical stress(r=.r=.221, p=.018), self concept(r=.221, p.018) of nursing students. Thus the more positive nursing performance, clinical stress and self concept, the higher assertiveness. But assertiveness of nursing students was negative correlation with anxiety scores(r=-.448,p=.000). Thus the more negative assertiveness of nursing students, the higher anxiety scores of nursing students.
5. The more positive self concept of nursing students, the higher clinical stress of nursing students(r=.226, p=.004).
6. The more positive self concept of nursing students, the higher nursing performance of nursing students(r=.217, p=.020). But the more negative mursing performance of nursing students, the higher anxiety scores of nursing students(r=-.203, p=.031).
7. By using stepwise multiple regression analysis, it was determined that assertiveness of nursing students was explained by self concept(28.8％) and self concept with anxiety(32.9％).
8. By using stepwise multiple regression analysis, Clinical stress was explained by self concept(6.1％) and nursing performance by assertiveness of nursing stuedents(6.1％).",양진주,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40029569

"안정지지면과 불안정지지면에서 스쿼트, 런지, 포워드스텝업 시 내측광근과 외측광근의 근활성도 비교","The objective of this study was to determine the change in electromyography (EMG) activity in the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) and the vastus lateralis (VL) during squat, lunge and forward step-up motions on different support surfaces. The subjects were 20 healthy adults (10 males and 10 females) who had not experienced a knee injury. They were asked to perform three knee exercises(squat, lunge and forward step-up) on stable and unstable surfaces. Electromyographic activities of the VMO and the VL were recorded using surface EMG and was normalized using the maximal voluntary isometric contraction elicited using a manual muscle testing. Paired t-test was used to determine the statistical differences between stable and unstable surfaces during the three exercises. The comparisons of the three exercises on stable and unstable surfaces were performed using a two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements. A Bonferroni adjustment was used for post hoc analysis. We used a two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements to determine whether there was an interaction effect between the exercise methods and the surface states. The EMG of the VL significantly increased during the lunge exercise on an unstable surface (p=.001). The EMG of the VMO increased during all three exercises on either surfaces, but showed no significant differences (p=.053). The EMG activities of the VL and the VMO during squat and lunge exercise on either surfaces were higher than during the forward step-up. The EMG activity ratio of the VMO and the VL showed no significant difference during any of the three exercises on either surfaces. The EMG activity of the VL may be beneficial during lunge exercises on unstable surfaces than on stable surfaces. This indicates that lunge exercises on unstable surfaces can be used to strengthen the VMO and the VL.",구본일,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100538875

"8주간의 걷기운동과 맨발걷기가 중년여성의 혈중 세로토닌, 코티졸, 에피네프린 그리고 노르에피네프린에 미치는 영향","The purpose of this study is to inspect effects of regular walking and barefoot walking, which is the easiest way for middle-aged women to exercise in daily life, on serotonin, cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine in blood and probe the differences of hormonal changes between two groups. Both of two programs were performed three times a week and each program lasted for more than 30 minutes. The group of regular walking was set at 40-60%(HRmax) and the group of walking barefoot was set at level 10-12(RPE). This research is for reducing middle-aged women's stress and helping to promote their health. All the data is processed by using the arithmetical mean and standard deviation and two-way ANOVA is used to verify differences between groups and durations. In case that there is interaction, independent t-test is used for group comparison and dependent t-test is used for duration comparison to inspect details. Degree of hypothesis acceptance is set at p<.05, p<.01, p<.00l. Firstly, the serotonin rate is reduced in both groups after conducting the programs. Significant main effect of serotonin has differences related to durations at F(1.18)=8.281, p=.01 but there's no differences between groups at F(1.18)=.289, p=.597. There is no differences in interaction as well at F(1.18)=.432, p=.520. Secondly, significant main effect of the cortisol rate in both groups after conducting the programs has no differences related to durations at F(1,18)=.292, p=.595 and there's no differences between groups at F(1.18)=.121, p=.732. There is no differences in interaction as well at F(1.18)=.899, p=.356. Thirdly, the result of paired t-test shows that epinephrine rate of the group performing regular walking is reduced more than one of those who walk barefoot at t=2.326, df=9, p=.045 and there is a difference in interaction at F(1.18)=5.815, p=.027. Lastly, the norepinephrine rate of those who take usual walks shows a meaningful difference related to durations at F(1.18)=24.505, p=.00l which is more noticeable than one of the other. However, there is no difference between groups at F(1.18)=.175, p=.680 and there is also no difference in interaction at F(1.18)=.902, p=.355. The result says that both of the programs, regular walking and walking barefoot, don't influence the amount of middle-aged women's stress positively, which is against the previous studies. It is because this research exclude other factors which can influence hormone secretion of middle-aged women such as weather, time, diet and mental state in middle age. It can be deduced that future researches to promote middle-aged women's health and decrease the symptoms of depression should include changes caused by temperature, time to exercise, exercise intensity and subject's psychological state in middle age.",정진숙,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107410857
청소년이 지각한 자기결정성동기와 성취목표지향성이 학업적 자기효능감에 미치는 영향,"This study has purpose to analyse the influences of the Self-Determination and the Achievement Goal Orientation realized by adolescents on the Academic Self-Efficacy and to examine theirs structural relation.
The following is the summary of this study's result.
Firstly, the study for the effects of Self-Determination on Achievement Goal Orientation shows that the proficiency-approach goal is greatly influenced by the internal motivation in a case of boys, and by the identified motivation for girls on the other hand.
Secondly, as examining the influences of the Self-Determination on the Academic Self-Efficacy, we can find out that for every adolescent the internal motivation has its major influence on the task difficulty preference. The self-regulatory is intensely influenced by the internal motivation for male adolescents and by identified motivation for female adolescents1. In addition, the fact that the external motivation for boys and the introjected motivation for girls have a negative effect on their self-confidence.
Thirdly, The study for the effect of the Achievement Goal Orientation on the Academic Self-Efficacy shows that in all adolescents, the more they aim the proficiency-approach goal, the more positive influence on task difficulty preference and the self-regulatory they get. Also The more they aim the performance-avoidance goal, the more negative influence on task the difficulty preference, the self-regulatory and the self-confidence they get.
Fourthly, after examining of structural relation among the Self-Determination, the Achievement Goal Orientation and the Academic Self-Efficacy, a goodness of fit of research model seems to be satisfactory. The Self-Determination influences on the Achievement Goal Orientation, the Achievement Goal Orientation influences on the Academic Self-Efficacy, and the Self-Determination influences also on the Academic Self-Efficacy through a medium of the Achievement Goal Orientation.
This study has its significance to show that the Self-Determination based on autonomy and the Achievement Goal Orientation giving value on the process influence on positive development of Academic Self-Efficacy. At the same time it provides useful basic data for middle·high school adolescents to have a healthy ego being more satisfied and more voluntary in the school.

Accordingly, the number of people with musculoskeletal dysfunction is increasing due to slouching while using their devices. A rounded shoulder is one such posture problems that occurs in the neck and shoulder region of adolescents. This posture may cause shortness of the pectoralis minor, abnormal postural alignment, and shoulder pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the immediate effect of shoulder brace use with elastic band exercise on body alignment in subjects with a rounded shoulder posture. The shoulder brace is designed to retraction and depression and posterior tilt on the scapula. University students (n=29) with a rounded shoulder were recruited and randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group(EG, n=14) had a shoulder brace with elastic band intervention, and the control
group (CG, n=15) had only elastic band intervention. To determine postural alignment,
the craniovertebral angle (CVA), shoulder angle (SA), pectoralis minor index (PMI), and kyphosis angle (KA) and level of neck, shoulder, thoracic discomfort were measured before and after the elastic band intervention. The exercise program consisted of three sets of 15 repetitions that lasted for 30 minutes. The analysis was conducted with 2 x 2 repeated analysis of variance. The EG and CG exhibited significantly increased PMI after intervention and significantly reducedSA (p<.05).

판례분석을 통한 혈흔형태의 증거능력과 증명력에 대한 고찰,"The basics of scientific verification is the reproducibility that is possible to verify the same phenomena by the third party using the given method. It is difficult to give the decisive meaning to determine guilty or not guilty when the effort to make the significant meaning from the small basis with the shortage of available evidences does not reach the basic requirements of scientific verification. In this paper, we considered the deficient part of scientific verification process that could not play crucial role in spite of many efforts and the positive considerations of justice department. We considered the admissibility of evidence and probative power of bloodstain pattern analysis in the homicide case of an old woman who died from the head injuries. The bloodstain of 4㎜ in diameter found in the inner side of a suspect’s left running shoe was inferred to an impact spatter and inferred that the bloodstain was created when a blood source in the victim’s head was broken up at a source by the suspect’s strike according to the bill of indictment and the report of bloodstain pattern analysis submitted to the court. The justice department, however, ruled the defendant not guilty because of the reason that it is difficult that the report of bloodstain pattern analysis proves the suspect guilty to the extent that ‘the judiciary exclude the reasonable doubt’. There are specific morphological proof, objective proof about the deposition time of bloodstains and the environment of deposition of the impact spatter in the condition of the analysis to the extent that the reasonable doubt was excluded in the bloodstain pattern analysis. But it seemed to have many difficulties in deciding as one. One of the objectivity guarantee or the basic notion of science is the problem that the third party can prove or approve specific facts by the same method or the same point of view. The morphological analysis such as bloodstain pattern analysis requires the proof of appropriateness about all variables generalizing the analysis that fits the objective facts, not the expert’s assertion. We wish the use of evidences of bloodstain pattern analysis takes a step forward with the considerations of this paper in the court that deals with similar cases.",박남규,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100549680
그리스 신화와 언어의 문제,"On language expressed in Greek myths Kim, Won-Ik (Yonsei University) Human beings have kept two stands on language since they invented their own languages. One is to believe that language is able to perfectly express human thoughts. The other is the skepticism that the language which has to be faulty is not. The minds of the former have been led by analytic philosophy, part of philosophy, while phenomenology have represented the latter. Ancient Greek myth writers, like modern exponents of phenomenology, also harbored their deep-rooted skepticism on the language utility. The stark antagonism and argument we now think shown in the conversations in Greek tragedies explain the rationale for the incompleteness of the language. They indicate that the evident incommunicability through words remains latent in their conversation, making them fail to reach a consensus, which tragically causes one of two parties to fade away. That's why we call the conversation in Greek tragedies “antilogia” instead of “dialogia”. The characters appearing in some Greek myths who seem to have mastery over language are often depreciated as mean-spirited and doomed. As examples, Echo, a chatterbox who ignored the talks of others, succumbed to a tragic end. The house of Rumors Goddess Fama is not just one of rumors, but a place haunted with empty words, which reflects this world's evanescent realities. But ancient Greek myth writers did not idle away while lamenting the limits of language. They tried to deal with the problems with consistency. They frequently employed the sophisticated similes to overcome the language bounds. According to Martin Hose, a simile is a characteristic in the epic style dramatically derived from the struggles of the authors who happen to be thrown into language obstacles. The creators constantly changed God's or character's names in their works, such as Athena-changed-Kythereia or Kythera, and Apollon-changed-Phoibos. The efforts were naturally made from the recognition on the imperfection of language that a given name is unable to denote the essence of an object like when in simile. The state is like “epoche” in phenomenology, where a judgement is pending due to linguistic limitations. The “epoche” is a pause where, to carve out the essence of an object, the concerned person ceased to judge at a point before comprehensively searching for various orientations to establish a certainty. Odysseus was an ideal model in Greek myths for ancient Greeks who had to cope with their language. He was trapped with his life being risked in a cave where Polyphemos one-eyed monster occupied. Odysseus stands for the nominalist language, while the giant represents the absolutist language. When asked to offer his name, Odysseus who saw through the difference produced a disguised name “Udeis” to him. The Udeis means ‘nobody’ in English. Using the false name, he managed to escape from the hands of the monster. Odysseus could exploit the supreme language playing to overturn the language limits. The consummate orator came to find himself as an ultimate trouble-shooter in looming conflicts. The skepticism on the language utility that Greek myth writers of early date had maintained was not, fortunately, led to a defeatist abandonment, but rather triggered a tremendous eruption of energy as seen in Odysseus. Had it not been for profound reflections on language among ancient Greeks, could Iliad, Odysseia, and other great Greek tragedies, have been unmatched treasures for humans, and could they be now?",김원익,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A81688716
미해결 사건의 신원불명 피해자들을 확인하기 위한 법과학 DNA 기법의 적용과정,"The usage of forensic DNA techniques to trace biological kinship is a very important process in identifying unknown deceased victims in unsolved murder cases. In most contexts, DNA collection to investigate unknown persons’ cases is entrusted to authorities under the assumption that the case may be a murder, an unnatural death or other crime. Short tandem repeats (STRs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and mitochondrial DNA analyses are three classes of markers which will play an important role in the present and the future of forensic DNA typing. Furthermore, the combination of Y-STRs and Y-SNPs provides valuable investigative leads on the geographical ancestry of the male trace donor. The mitochondrial DNA is highly polymorphic and can also provide statistical inferences of a DNA donor’s bio-geographical ancestry. In the case of unresolved murder, identification of unknown victim provides a clue to a very important case resolution. Therefore, we need to discuss the use forensic DNA information to identify for unknown victims of unnatural death related to murder cases.",조남수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108574779

돼지 부패 실험을 이용한 사후경과시간(PMI) 추정,"Researchers of the study initiated the experiment by burying a dead pig in the ground and then observing the decaying process for approximately a month (from June 2, 2010 to June 30, 2010) in an attempt to survey features of forensic entomology as well as PMI measurement methodology. The insects collected, in terms of taxonomy, included 19 families, 33 species, 135 kingdoms and 5 orders. Participants of the study calculated PMI statistics on the basis of temperature changes collected by a movable meteorological observatory and a probe-mounted temperature recorder. Based on the hourly rate of maggot accumulation researchers concluded that the pig died between 8 and 9 p.m. of June 3’rd, but the measurement of mean temperature suggested that it took place between midnight of June 2’nd and 1 a.m. of June 3’rd.

작품에 반영된 작가의 삶,"Author's Life Represented in His Works Kim, Gye-sook (Sangmyung University) Most writers say there are nothing to do with between their works and their private lives. Therefore, when someone asks the relationship between the works and author's lives, they usually deny the relationship. But there are many works of which characters are the mirror up to the author themselves. Especially Pinter's Betrayal illustrates his own marital crack-up. Pinter's plays are commonly triggered by a sharp memory of some personal experience. Pinter had utilized not just his own experience but also that of friends and acquaintances. He was to do the same in Betrayal. It is a play about the way of betryal of oneself and others through the whole system of human relationship. It also shows Pinter, more than in any of his previous plays, using directly the circumstances of his own life. As the author writes about actual events, his friends and lovers who see the play come out saying, “Oh, it's the story of my life.” Then using these materials is the author's moral dilemma? Author takes what he needs from actual experience and invests it with dramatic signification. But as Pinter says “there are some things one remembers even though they may never have happened.” At the same time in place of the audience, we can sympathize liable characters more than ever before.",김계숙,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A81688723
전통 단청에 사용된 채색안료의 현황과 원료 특성: 국가지정 목조건축문화재를 중심으로,"In this study, the composition of traditional Korean Dancheong pigments existing innational-designated wooden architectural heritages was analyzed, and the current status of pigmentsaccording to the raw material characteristics used was statistically examined. As for the red pigment,Seokganju, Yeondan, Jusa had a high share, and natural and artificial inorganic pigments had a highusage rate. As for yellow pigments, organic pigments(estimated Deunghwang), Hhwangto, and goldshowed a high share. In the case of organic pigments and gold, Yeonbaek was used as a based pigmentto increase color development. As for the green pigment, Hayeob, Noerok, Samrok showed a highshare. The Hayeob and Neorok are identified as a single raw material, but it can be seen that theSamrok is made by mixing copper oxides such as moolooite and lead-based white raw materials. Bluepigments have a lower share of pigments compared to other colors. As for the blue pigment, Guncheong,Hoecheong, and Seokcheong showed a high market share, and natural and artificial inorganic pigmentsaccounted for the majority. In particular, it is characteristic that the use of expensive pigments suchas Seokcheong and Guncheong is concentrated on the Palace Dancheong. White and black pigmentshave a low share in Dancheong coloring, but the white and black lines play a very important rolein the perfection of Dancheong. It can be seen that the white pigment has a high share of Baekto(whiteclay) and Yeonbaek, and is used not only for coloring but also as a based pigment for color pigments.
Most of the black pigment is made up of more than 95% organic raw material containing carbon asits main component, and it shows various aspects depending on the lower pigment layer. Through this,it was confirmed based on on-site analysis data of wooden architectural heritage that the color pigmentused in Dancheong had a higher percentage of use of inorganic pigments and that the use rate of naturalinorganic pigments was higher than that of artificial synthetic pigments in inorganic pigments.",황가현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108392724
