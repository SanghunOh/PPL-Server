Here, we summarize the status of research on the effect of microplastics on marine life and suggest future research directions. Microplastics are synthetic polymeric compounds smaller than 5 mm and these materials released into the environment are not only physically small but do not decompose over time. Thus, they accumulate extensively on land, from the coast to the sea, and from the surface to the deep sea. Microplastic can be ingested and accumulated in marine life. Furthermore, the elution of chemicals added to plastic represents another risk. Microplastics accumulated in the ocean affect the growth, development, behavior, reproduction, and death of marine life. However, the properties of microplastics vary widely in size, material, shape, and other aspects and toxicity tests conducted on several properties of microplastics cannot represent the hazards of all other microplastics. It is necessary to evaluate the risks according to the types of microplastic, but due to their variety and the lack of uniformity in research results, it is difficult to compare and analyze the results of previous studies. Therefore, it is necessary to derive a standard test method to estimate the biological risk from different types of microplastics. In addition, while most of the previous studies were conducted mostly on spheres for the convenience of the experiments, they do not properly reflect the reality that fibers and fragments are the main forms of microplastics in the marine environment and in fish and shellfish. Furthermore, studies have been conducted on additives and POPs (persistent organic pollutants) in plastics, but little is known about their toxic effects on the body. The effects of microplastics on the marine ecosystems and humans could be identified in more detail if standard testing methods are developed, microplastics in the form of fibers and fragments rather than spheres are tested, and additives and POPs are analyzed. These investigations will allow us to identify the impact of microplastics on marine ecosystems and humans in more detail.",김강희,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106504798
초파리의 발육 단계에 따른 온도의 영향,"In order to see the developmental rates and the emergence rates of Drosophila melanogaster, having been reared in laboratory, whose wings has been grown at each development under different temperatures, the five strains of Drosophila melanogaster were examined, and so.
The results were shown as follows ;
The emergence rates of all the five strains of D. melanogaster were decreased at the stage of egg treated with both high and low temperatures, but decreased exceedingly under the high temperature treatments.
The emergence rates of all five strains of D. melanogaster were decreased at the stages of larva, treated with both high and low temperature, too, but the more developmental stages were progressed, the less the third stage of larva had its difference eventually.
The emergence rates treated with the stage of larva were lower than that of the stage of egg, but the difference of the emergence rates was small according to the terms of temperature.
The effects of temperature treatment were few at the stage of pupa.
The resistance under the low temperature of D. melanogaster was stronger than that under the high temperature of D. melanogaster.
The resistance of temperature related with the five strains of D. melanogaster had no significant difference.

식물바이러스 면역반응 최신 연구 동향 및 전망,"Plant viruses cause significant yield losses and continuously threaten crop production, representing a serious threat to global food security. Studies on plant-virus interactions have contributed to increase our knowledge on plant immunity mechanism, providing new strategies for crop improvement. The prophylactic managements consist mainly following international legislations, eradication of infected plants, and application of pesticide to decrease the population of vectors. Hence, putting together the pieces of knowledge related to molecular plant immunity to viruses is critical for the control of virus disease in fields. Over the last several decades, the outstanding outcomes of extensive research have been achieved on comprehension of plant immunity to viruses. Although most dominant R genes have been used as natural resistance genes, recessive resistance genes have been deployed in several crops as another efficient strategy to control viruses. In addition, RNA interference also regulates plant immunity and contribute a very efficient antiviral system at the nucleic acid level.

식물 RNA 바이러스의 진화와 병저항성 극복 기작,"Plant RNA viruses are one of the most destructive pathogens that cause a significant loss in crop production worldwide. They have evolved with high genetic diversity and adaptability due to the short replication cycle and high mutation rate during genome replication, which are characteristics of RNA viruses. Plant RNA viruses exist as quasispecies with high genetic diversity; thereby, a rapid population transition with new fitness can occur due to selective pressure resulting from environmental changes. Plant resistance can act as selective pressure and affect the fitness of the virus, which may lead to the emergence of resistance-breaking variants. In this paper, we introduced the evolutionary perspectives of plant RNA viruses and the driving forces in their evolution. Based on this, we discussed the mechanism of the emergence of variant viruses that overcome plant resistance. In addition, strategies for deploying plant resistance to viral diseases and improving resis- tance durability were discussed.",김명휘(Myung-Hwi Kim),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107974732
E. coli의 유전자 발현 및 플라스미드 DNA 구조의 특성에 관한 연구,"Characterization and electron microscopic visualization of the plasmid and the gene expression of Escherichia coli were carried out. Transcriptional units of active structural genes were observed after lysis of Escherichia coli cells. The ribosomes attached to the E. coli genome on mRNA molecule as polyribosomes. From this gradient of polyribosome length, we estimated location of mRNA synthesis initiation site. In this experiment, a granule is ofen present which may correspond to a RNA polymerase at the promoter site. pOX1, pOX7, pOX7A, pOX7Δ1, pSTP36, pSTP21, pBR322, and pJH12 were visualized by way of electron microscope, and their estimated sizes were determined to be 5.70±0.08 ㎛, 2.25±0.06 ㎛, 2.15±0.10 ㎛, 2.14±0.12 ㎛, 7.39±0.08 ㎛, 4.03±0.04 ㎛, 1.50±0.03 ㎛ and 1.25±0.09 ㎛ respectively.

PET분해효소(PETase) 과발현 전세포 촉매의 해양미세플라스틱 생분해 활성 연구,"The increased production and consumption of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based products over the past several decades has resulted in the discharge of countless tons of PET waste into the marine environment. PET microparticles resulting from the physical erosion of general PET wastes end up in the ocean and pose a threat to the marine biosphere and human health, necessitating the development of new technologies for recycling and upcycling. Notably, enzyme-mediated PET degradation is an appealing option due to its eco-friendly and energy-saving characteristics. PETase, a PET-hydrolyzing enzyme originating from Ideonella sakaiensis, is one of the most thoroughly researched biological catalysts. However, the industrial application of PETase-mediated PET recycling is limited due to the low stability and poor reusability of the enzyme. Here we developed the whole-cell catalyst (WCC) in which functional PETase is attached to the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Immunoassays are used to identify the surface-expressed PETase, and we demonstrated that the WCC degraded PET microparticles most efficiently at 30°C and pH 9 without agitation. Furthermore, the WCC increased the PET-degrading activity in a concentration-dependent manner, surpassing the limited activity of soluble PETase above 100 nM. Finally, we demonstrated that the WCC could be recycled up to three times.",김현지,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108405351
밀레니얼 세대의 비건트렌드에 대한 인식 및 미래 요구도 조사,"Objectives: This study examined the perception of the vegan trend of millennials and their future needs.
Methods: This study was conducted online from June 21, 2021, to July 15, 2021, targeting 425 adult men and women born between 1980 and 2000. The contents of the survey were divided into four categories: general information, awareness of vegetables, awareness of vegan trends, and future needs for vegan trends.
Results: Most respondents recognized the importance of eating vegetables and perceived vegetarianism and veganism as a lifestyle. Regarding the perception of the vegan trend, the highest response rate was ‘The vegan trend is to be satisfied with my life regardless of other people’, while the lowest response rate was ‘The vegan trend is only a temporary fad’. The reasons for purchasing vegan products with high response rates were ‘interest in the earth and environment’, ‘protection of animal rights’, and ‘thinking about health’. The type of vegan product wanted in the future was delicious food, and convenience level was in the order of ‘completely cooked’, ‘half-cooked’, and ‘pre-processed’. Among the sustainable vegetarian types that millennials responded, ‘semi-vegetarian’, which can consume most animal products excluding red meat, showed the highest response rate.

Methods: The survey was conducted on 49 patients whose hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level ranged from 6.5% to below 10% among patients aged 30∼60s with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nutrition counseling by the NCP process was carried out twice: first nutrition counseling and follow up counseling. The questionnaires were composed of 54 questions in five fields (general characteristics, health-related behaviors, diet therapyrelated items, dietary life, diet therapy-related knowledge, diet therapy-related barriers). Nutrition intervention in nutrition counseling was performed based on the individualized diagnosis of NCP.
Results: All the subjects practiced self-monitoring of their blood glucose levels, regular exercise, and diet therapy after NCP-based nutrition counseling. Diet therapy-related knowledge and practice by the subjects were improved after nutrition counseling. While the intake of boiled white rice decreased, the intake of boiled brown rice and barley rice in the subjects increased significantly. After nutrition counseling, the weight and HbA1c of the subjects decreased.
Conclusions: These results suggest that personalized nutrition counseling by NCP process is effective for diet therapy compliance and glycemic control of type 2 diabetic patients.",배태정,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106928742

쌍둥이 지구의'생명'은 생명인가?,"This study examines some discussions on a criterion that astrobiology uses in determining whether some evidences detected in extraterrestrial environment is the evidence of life or not, and also examines critically our conceptual scheme on life. On the Earth, the boundary between living things and non-living things is generally evident, so the question, ""What is Life?"" is not a central theme of biology on terrestrial life. However, in extraterrestrial environment, this question is critical. Putnam's thought experiment, which is called ""Twin Earth"" is a model for that environment. Evidences detected by space probes or by meteorites, show the cases of ""Twin Earth"". Those evidences share themselves with some important properties of terrestrial life, but they do not share themselves with other important properties. So, the question whether these cases can be qualified for life or not, does not have a clear solution. In order to cope with this question, NASA suggests a criterion of life: a ""self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution."" This criterion is more relevant than any other suggested criteria, because in the explication of specificity of biological phenomena, the explication of some kinds of a goal-oriented behavior is the most important task. And this criterion includes an important suggestion of an empirical research programmes of astrobiology. This arguments depend on some theories, so this study needs more philosophical reflection, This study answers two philosophical questions: First, life is a type of the scattered in the space, so an ontological model of a relation of identity between extraterrestrial and terrestrial life, is a homeostatic property cluster(HPC) kinds by Richard Boyd, especially type-HPC. Second, NASA's criterion on life is dependent on natural history and biochemistry.

Methods: A nationally representative sample of 20,421 19-64-year-olds who had 24- hour recall data was taken from the 2014-2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Single- and non single-persons were compared for nutrient intake, dietary behaviors, food consumption patterns, nutrition education and confirm nutrition label.
Results: The dietary intakes of dietary fiber and iron were lower in single-person households than in non single-person households. The lower the level of education and income, the lower the nutrient intake of single-person households. In the case of those aged 19 to 29, the breakfast skipping rate was higher in single-person households than in non single-person households. The higher the education level, the higher the breakfast skipping rate and the eating out frequency in the single-person households. In the food intake survey, the frequency of healthy food intake in single-person households was much lower than that of non single-person households. The confirmation rate of nutrition labeling was lower in single-person households than in non single-person households.

한국 청소년의 가당음료 섭취 관련 건강 행동 요인 분석,"Objectives: This study was conducted to measure the intake rate of SSBs (sugar sweetened beverages) and examine the relationship between health behavior factors and SSBs intake by adolescents.
Methods: This study used data from the 2016 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, which included 65,528 study participants. SSBs intake frequency was measured by asking respondents if they consumed soda, high-caffeinated beverages, and sugary drinks during the previous week. Type of intake was categorized into three groups according to the number of consumed drinks [SSBs (0): None; SSBs (1-2): 1 or 2 consumed; SSBs (3): 3 consumed]. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine health behaviors that affected SSBs consumption.
Results: Increased SSBs intake was significantly correlated with current smoking (OR=2.4, 95% CI=1.82-3.17), current drinking (OR=2.13, 95% CI=1.82-2.51), sedentary time increase (OR=1.31, 95% CI=1.15-1.49), three days or more physical activity per week (OR=1.12, 95% CI=1.02-1.24), <8 hours sleep (OR=1.6, 95% CI=1.43-1.78), increased internet usage time (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.25-1.65).
Conclusions: Sugar-sweetened beverages intake by Korean adolescents was associated with health behaviors such as smoking, drinking, sedentary time increase, more physical activity, poor sleeping time, and increased internet use time. Based on these results, it is necessary to recognize the influence of SSBs intake and to intervene to reduce consumption of SSBs.",구혜민,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430560
20세 이상 성인의 먹방 시청 시간에 따른 식행동 비교 연구,"Objectives: This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between watching mukbang (eating broadcasts) and dietary and health behavior in adults who watch mukbang.
Methods: The questionnaire was administered on a self-written basis through online and offline formats to 800 adults (400 men and 400 women). The contents of the survey consisted of general characteristics, mukbang viewing time per week, breakfast intake frequency, preference for menus when viewing mukbang, delivery food intake frequency per week, late meal intake frequency per week, and health behavior. The subjects were divided into three groups according to mukbang viewing time.
Results: The body weight of viewers was significantly higher when mukbang viewing time was over 14 hours for both men and women. In particular, based on the BMI (body mass index), those who watched mukbang for more than 14 hours were found to be overweight. People with more than 14 hours of mukbang viewing time per week were found to prefer mostly carbohydrate-rich food and meat, while those with less than 7 hours of mukbang viewing time per week showed a higher preference for vegetables and fruits. An analysis of the frequency of breakfast eaten showed that the rate of skipping breakfast was the highest for those who watched mukbang for more than 14 hours per week, and the rate of eating breakfast daily was the highest in the case of fewer than 7 hours of viewing. In the case of high mukbang viewing time per week, the frequency of food delivery and night eating was high. When mukbang viewing time was high, the viewer’s interest in health was low and the frequency of exercising too was low.
Conclusions: Viewers with high mukbang viewing time showed undesirable health and eating behavior. Thus, it is believed that proper nutrition education on improving eating habits and raising the awareness of correct eating habits is necessary for such viewers.",남하얀(Ha-Yan Nam),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107401831

한국 성인의 단백질 섭취량 추이 및 적절성 평가: 2010 ~ 2019년 국민건강영양조사 자료를 활용하여,"Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate dietary protein intake and its adequacy among Korean adults during recent 10 years.
Methods: Based on the 2010 ~ 2019 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data, a total of 51,296 adults aged 19 years old or more who participated in a one-day 24-hr dietary recall were included. Dietary protein intake was estimated as percentages of total energy (% of energy) and grams per body weight (g/kg/ day) and compared with the 2020 Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans to evaluate the adequacy of protein intake. In addition, proportions of people whose protein intakes were less than the estimated average requirement (EAR) and above the upper limit of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) (> 20% of energy) were calculated according to sociodemographic characteristics.
Results: Protein intake was increased from 14.7% of energy in 2010 to 15.6% of energy in 2019 among Korean adults. However, there was no increase in protein intake relative to the recommended nutrient intake (% RNI) during the recent 10 years. Protein intake relative to the RNI was decreased from 130.2% in 2010 to 121.1% in 2019 (P for trend < 0.0001) among total participants, and a significant decreasing trend was observed in all age groups except for over 65 years old. However, protein intake relative to the RNI was lowest in the elderly (98.6%). Proportions of low protein intake (< EAR) and high protein intake (> AMDR) increased in the past 10 years (P for trend < 0.0001 for all), and these were associated with socioeconomic statuses, such as education and household income levels. Conclusions: These findings suggest that protein adequacy in Korean adults has not been improved over the past decade compared with recommended levels.

The number of lactic acid bacteria in all the sample products were contained over than 10^7 cfu/ml with regal level during transportation.",최선규,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19598274
대기오염과 토양산성화에 따른 녹지의 토양완충능력 변화,"Air pollution caused many problems in the natural environment. One of the serious impacts is a soil acidification as a result of accumulating the acid pollutants from atmosphere for a long time. Soils and natural environments have been acidified due to the pollutants coming from industrial and urban areas in Korea. Soil acidification and soil buffer capacity were investigated at six different locations. Soil acidities of the urban and industrial areas were higher than that of the mountain areas. The high soil acidity at the urban area was probably due to the long-term accumulation of acid pollutants. Soil chemical characteristics seemed to be affected by the atmospheric pollutants in the urban and industrial areas. However, soil buffer capacities of the study sites did not followed the pattern of soil property changes. The soil buffer capacity was highest at Ulsan and lowest at Seosan, where the soil buffer capacities were determined by the original soil properties. The soil buffer capacities were positively related to the cation exchange capacities.",김동엽,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19598297
보건소 영양사 직무 분석 (Ⅰ),"The purpose of this study was to analyze task performance and importance level of the dietitian who is working in the public health nutrition area. Work oriented job analysis methodology was employed for the study purpose. Subjects of 38 dietitians currently working at health centers in 2002 were recruited. Based on the focus group interview with 7 public health nutritionists and 7 professors, information about task elements was collected. Questionnaires measuring work performance and self-perception of importance of the selected task elements were administered. The results of this study can be summarized as follows; 1) The tasks with high performance and importance level among 20 tasks are developing nutrition education material (B1), nutrition services for adults and the elderly (C3), writing the proposal for nutrition services (A2), evaluating service effect (A4), improving professionalism (E1), and self management (E2). 2) The task elements with high performance and importance level among weekly task elements are nutrition education for diabetes (C56), nutrition counseling for adults (C47), nutrition for hypertension (C53), managing and keeping records (C80), nutrition education for kindergarten and nursery school children (C42), searching for nutrition education materials (B26), and searching for media (B27). 3) The number of task elements with high performance and importance level among monthly task elements are 13 in the planning and evaluation of public health nutrition service, and 5 in developing nutrition education materials. The tasks of a dietitian in the public health center show a very wide spectrum. However dietitians recognize most of the tasks are important even though they cannot perform those tasks adequately.",박혜련,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82489913
금화규(Abelmoschus manihot) 뿌리 추출물의 면역증진 및 항비만효과,"In this study, we investigated in vitro immune-enhancing and anti-obesity activity of Abelmoschus manihot roots (AMR) in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and mouse adipocytes 3T3-L1 cells. AMR increased the production of immunostimulatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in RAW264.7 cells. The inhibition of toll like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4 blocked AMR-mediated production of immunostimulatory factors in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway reduced AMR-mediated production of immunostimulatory factors. From these results, AMR is considered to have immune-enhancing activity through TLR2/4-mediated activation of MAPKs signaling pathway. In addition, AMR inhibited lipid accumulation and reduced the protein level such as CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), perilipin-1, adiponectin and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) associated with lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that AMR may have anti-obesity activity. Based on these results, AMR is expected to be used as a potential functional agent for immune enhancement and anti-obesity.",유주형(Ju Hyeong Yu),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107891098
1997년 이후 홍콩인 정체성의 지속과 변화,"This study is to examine the continuity and change of 'Hongkonger' identity in HongKong since 1997, when the sovereignty returned from the British to the People's Republic of China. It concentrates on the characteristics and meanings of the economic structure in Hong Kong society. Hong Kong has experienced the drastic change of social structure or cultural systems, including economic structure and its process. She has experienced the enormous cultural change with relation to the change of political systems and economic structures. HongKonger has faced upon the predictable social situations when they had migrated from mainland China, especially from the southern area of mainland China including Guangdong province. They have settled down successfully under the strange and heterogeneous circumstances by utilizing the various adaptive strategy effectively.
From this perspective, how the HongKonger identity will be changed? Some aspects of them may be maintained despite of the drastic social change by the Chinese government's political power and economic policy. But some aspects of them will be changed drastically. Perhaps, HongKonger may experience the cultural conflict between the Hongkonger identity and the Chinse identity with relation to the differences between democratic system and socialist system in politics, between the global or world capitalist system and the mixed system with socialist and capitalist economic system, between the social order with international or global standard of living and planned standard of living by the solid and strong state.
In various and subtle conflicts and tensions, the Hongkonger has experienced the cultural pressure from the powerful demands of the cultural characteristics of 'Hong Kong-ness' since1997. In present, they experience the confusion of their cultural identities in the process of culture contacts between the previous culture and the new culture after 1997.
Because the cultural identity of particular group is not an isolated social entity, but a cultural construct that is formed and transformed continuously in particular historical experience, the cultural identities of Hongkonger also are formed and transformed in according to the continuity and change of cultural characteristics and meanings of their identities. In this sense, the cultural identity of Hongkonger can be regarded as an flexible and changable construct in the process of particular historical and social circumstance. Its characteristics and meanings have been expressed remarkably in the continuity and change of Hongkonger identity since 1997.",홍석준,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A344304
지역아동센터 이용 어린이의 비만관리의 한계점과 모바일폰의 잠재적인 활용 가능성: 어린이와 보호자 대상의 질적 연구,"Objectives: This study was performed to identify the current barriers of obesity management for children using Community Child Care Centers and their caregivers (parents and teachers working in the Centers). Further, this study explored the possibility of utilizing a mobile phone application for tailored obesity prevention and management programs to overcome the current difficulties associated with children's obesity management.
Methods: The qualitative data were collected through in-depth interviews with 20 obese and overweight children or children who wanted to participate in this study using Community Child Care Centers, 12 teachers working at the Centers, and a focus group interview with five parents of children using the Centers. Data were analyzed with a thematic approach categorizing themes and sub-themes based on the transcripts.
Results: The current barriers of obesity management of obese and overweight children using Community Child Care Centers were lack of self-directed motivation regarding obesity management (chronic obesity-induced lifestyles and reduced self-confidence due to stigma) and lack of support from households and Community Child Care Centers (latchkey child, inconsistency in dietary guidance between the Center and household, repetitive pressure to eat, and absence of regular nutrition education). Mobile phone applications may have potential to overcome the current barriers by providing handy and interesting obesity management based on visual media (real-time tracking of lifestyles using behavior records and social support using gamification), environmental support (supplementation of parental care and network-based education between the Community Child Care Center and household), and individualized intervention (encouragement of tailored and gradual changes in eating habits and tailored goal setting). It is predicted that the real-time mobile phone program will provide information for improving nutritional knowledge and behavioral skills as well as lead to sustainable children’s coping strategies regarding obesity management. In addition, it is expected that environmental factors may be improved by network-based education between the Community Child Care Centers and households using the characteristics of mobile phones, which are free from space and time constraints.
Conclusions: The tailored education program for children using Community Child Care Centers based on mobile phones may prevent and reduce childhood obesity by overcoming the current barriers of obesity management for children, providing environmental and individualized support to promote healthy lifestyles and quality of life in the future.",이보영,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106928523
주부의 취업여부에 따른 가족구성원의 영양상태 비교,"In order to investigate if the employment of housewives may affect the nutritional status of their family members, an analysis was made for the data of 2001 Korea National Health and Nutrition survey. Housewives aged 20 or over were divided into two groups of the working (W, 44.3%) and the non-working (NW, 55.7%), and household income levels were divided into 4 groups of low, middle, high, and high above according to the minimum cost of living in the year of 2001. Nutrient intakes were assessed by using dietary recommended intakes for Koreans of 2005. Working housewives showed similar levels to those of non-working housewives in most nutrients intakes except energy and vitamin C. However their families excluding housewives of W, than those of NW, took less protein, calcium, iron, potassium, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C when assessed as % of recommended intakes and took more sodium. Such differences were very strong in children and adolescents, and in the middle income households. More% of the families of W than those of NW consumed nutrients below the estimated average requirements. Percents of hypertension classified by both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were higher in adult family members of W than in those of NW. This tendency seemed to be more significant in the family members aged 30 to 49. Both obesity and under-weight rates of school children (7~12 yrs) in W were higher than those in NW. The above resuIts suggested that employment of housewives could have negative influences on the nutritional status of their family members, especially of their children and in the middle income class.",이정원,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82489932
채소 및 육류 섭취의 상대적인 선호도와 암 발생의 연관성: 국민건강보험공단 국민건강정보자료 활용,"Objectives: We aimed to examine the association between the relative preference for vegetables and meat and cancer incidence, in a population-based retrospective cohort in Korea.
Methods: We included 10,148,131 participants (5,794,124 men; 4,354,007 women) who underwent national health screening between 2004 and 2005 from the National Health Information Database of the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS-NHID). Participants were asked whether they preferred consuming 1) vegetables more often, 2) both vegetables and meat or 3) meat more often. Participants were followed up to Dec. 31, 2017. All cancer and eighteen common cancer cases were identified through the code from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision. We estimated sexspecific relative risks and 95% confidence intervals, adjusting for age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and income level.
Results: During an average follow-up of 12.4 years, 714,170 cancer cases were documented. In men, consuming meat more often was associated with lower risk of esophageal, liver, and stomach cancers, but higher risk of lung and kidney cancers. Consuming both vegetables and meat was associated with higher risk of prostate cancer, but with lower risk of esophageal, liver, and stomach cancers in men. In women, consuming meat more often was associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer and breast, endometrial, and cervical cancers diagnosed before the age of 50. Consuming both vegetables and meat was associated with lower risk of liver cancer in women.
Conclusions: Our study suggests a potential link between vegetable and meat intake and cancer incidence in the Korean population. Further investigation on the association between the intake of specific types of vegetables and meat and cancer risk in Korean prospective cohort studies is needed.",이가은(Ga-Eun Yie),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107778392
식이 질 지수를 이용하여 평가한 한국 성인의 식생활과 대사 위험인자와의 관련성: 2016 ~ 2019 국민건강영양조사 자료 이용,"Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the relationship between metabolic risk factors, Index of Nutrition Quality, and the dietary quality index score of Korean adults. Methods: The subjects were 18,652 Korean adults aged 19 years or older (7,899 males, 10,753 females) who participated in the 2016-2019 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Subjects were divided into normal, pre-metabolic syndrome, and metabolic syndrome (MetS) groups according to the number of their metabolic risk factors. Data were analyzed using the SPSS program.
Results: About 44.7% of men in the MetS group were at least college graduates (P < 0.001), whereas 52.0% of women in the MetS group were middle school graduates or lower (P < 0.001). The frequency of fruit and dairy products intake tended to decrease as the number of metabolic risk factors increased in both men and women (P for trend < 0.001). As the number of metabolic risk factors decreased, the frequency of grain intake tended to decrease in men (P for trend < 0.001) while the frequency of intake of red meat (P for trend = 0.001), poultry (P for trend < 0.001), and eggs (P for trend < 0.001) decreased in women. The total scores of Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I) (men P < 0.001, women P < 0.01) and Korean Healthy Eating Index (KHEI) (men and women P < 0.001) were significantly lower in the MetS group compared to the other groups, and the total score of DQI-I and KHEI tended to decrease as the number of metabolic risk factors increased. Conclusions: Dietary quality evaluation using various indices can provide more information on the dietary problems related to metabolic risk factors. Nutrients and foods that have been confirmed to be related to metabolic risk factors can be used to develop dietary guidelines for the nutritional management of metabolic diseases.",딩총위,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108182978
탄산음료와 탄산수의 대체관계에 영향을 미치는 식품선택요인 연구,"Objectives: This research was conducted to identify the consumers’ food choice factors that affect the consumers’ replacement of soft drinks with carbonated water.
Methods: The present study used secondary data from a consumer panel survey conducted by the Rural Development Administration of Korea, and the data included the panel members’ purchase records based on their monthly spending receipts. The survey asked the participants about their food choice factors and their personal responsibility for their health. This survey included independent variables for the consumers’ food purchase factors. As a dependent variable, two types of groups were defined. The replacement group included those people who increased their purchase of carbonated water and decreased their purchase of soft drinks. The non-replacement group included those people who did not change their purchase patterns or they increased their purchase of soft drinks and they decreased their purchase of carbonated water. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the consumers’ food choice factors that were associated with replacing soft drinks with carbonated water.
Results: The replacement group was significantly associated with (1) a younger age (OR=0.953), (2) being a housewife (OR=2.03), (3) higher income (OR=1.001) and (4) less concern about price (OR=0.819) when purchasing food. This group also showed (5) higher enjoyment (OR=1.328) when choosing food and (6) they took greater responsibly for their personal health (OR=1.233).
Conclusions: This research is the first study to mainly focus on soft drinks and carbonated water.
The result of this research showed that young, health-conscious consumers with a higher income and who are more interested in food have more possibilities to replace soft drinks with carbonated water. These research findings may be applied to consumers who have characteristics that are similar to the young health-conscious consumers and the results can help to suggest ways to reduce sugar intake and improve public health. However, this research has a limitation due to the application of secondary data. Therefore, a future study is needed to develop detailed survey questions about food choice factors and to extend these factors to all beverages, including soft drinks made with sugar substitutes, so as to reflect the growth of alternative industries that use artificial sweeteners or different types of sugar to make commercially available drinks.",박서영,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106345625
