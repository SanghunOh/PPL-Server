범죄현장 조사용 루미놀 시약의 제조법에 관한 연구,"Finding the blood left at a crime scene is very important to reconstruct or solve a criminal case.
Although numerous reagents have been developed for use at crime scenes, luminol is the most representative.
Bluestar Forensic has been used in recent years, but is expensive and cannot be stored after preparation. This study aims to develop a new luminol reagent that can be stored for a long period of time while maintaining the chemiluminescence intensity at the level of Bluestar Forensic. Because luminol dissolves well in aqueous alkaline solutions, the use of sodium hydroxide in the preparation of luminol reagents can promote the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Magnesium sulfate, sodium silicate, and potassium triphosphate have been used as hydrogen peroxide stabilizers. The effects of the addition of these substances on the chemiluminescence emission intensity and the storage period of the luminol reagents were confirmed. The addition of a hydrogen peroxide stabilizer was shown to have no significant affect on the chemiluminescence emissions intensity or stabilized pH of the luminol reagent during storage. It also greatly increases the shelf life of the reagents. The use of magnesium sulfate as a hydrogen peroxide stabilizer is the most appropriate. When sodium perborate is used instead of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidizing agent, there is no significant change in the sensitivity and chemiluminescence emissions intensity, but the storage period is shortened. However, after the reaction with blood, the pH of the mixed solution does not increase significantly, and is judged to be more suitable than a reagent made of hydrogen peroxide.",임승,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105122468
미세플라스틱 제거를 위한 고도산화기술 최신 연구 동향,"Microplastics comprise plastic particles that are less than 5 mm in size. Owing to a significant increase in plastic production, micro plastics have become ubiquitous pollutants worldwide. Several studies have reported that microplastics are harmful to living organisms because they can adsorb contaminants from the environment due to their unique physicochemical properties. The adsorbed contaminants on microplastics can be released and accumulated in living organisms, thereby adversely affecting the health of humans and animals. Since existing water treatment technologies as stand-alone processes cannot achieve complete removal of microplastics, reliable methods must be developed. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are a promising approach for the chemical treatment of contaminants such as microplastics. These processes utilize highly reactive oxygen species (e.g., hydroxyl radicals, sulfate radicals, superoxide anions, and singlet oxygen) to decompose microplastics completely. However, at this stage, AOPs can partially degrade and/or alter surface chemistry of microplastics. Therefore, extensive effort must be made to further study AOPs for complete decomposition of microplastics.",김정연,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108545138

여대생의 일상 화장품 사용 시 안전 관심도와 화장품 성분 유해성 인식의 관련성 연구,"This study was conducted to investigate the perception of the harmfulness of cosmetics components according to safety interest in the use of daily cosmetics by female college students. For 30 days from September 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019, 791 female college students in Seoul and Gyeonggi area were surveyed. 727 copies were selected as the final analysis subjects and conducted by self-administering. The data were analyzed by using SPSS 21.0 program. The results showed that the safety awareness of ingredients according to the safety interest of cosmetics was higher than the functional awareness(p<0.001). The recognition of cosmetic reliability showed that the level of trust in organic cosmetics was high, and the recognition of cosmetic harmfulness was the highest in oxybenzone, and the safety awareness of the ingredients of the product was high in the order of synthetic coloring agent, synthetic flavoring agent, and oxybenzone. As a result of the study, safety awareness of cosmetics is high, but safety education and publicity are needed to recognize the harmfulness of cosmetics ingredients. It is considered that more systematic and professional education on chemical substances such as the use of allergen-inducing substances by customized cosmetics managers as well as education and promotion on safety of various cosmetics to be more diversely prepared due to the emergence of diverse functional cosmetics and customized cosmetics managers is needed.",이하정,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106984839
탄소중립 가스터빈 연소 기술 동향,"This report surveys recent developments of carbon-neutral gas turbine combustion technology. Since the Paris Climate Agreement in 2019, each country committed a nationally determined contribution (NDC) which identifies key targets to reduce the temperature rise. In order to meet the NDC, each government is pushing hard to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and using carbon-neutral fuel is a straightforward way to reduce to achieve the goals. As carbon-neutral fuels such as hydrogen or ammonia have different thermodynamic and transport properties, it needs paradigm changes in many related sectors.

식품 중 조단백질 정량을 위한 켈달법과 듀마스법 비교 연구,"In this study, crude protein was analyzed and compared using the Kjeldahl and Dumas method for cereals, meat, sea food, chemical samples and vegetable. The nine kinds of cereal, including white rice, were analyzed. In the result, the correlation coefficient of the Kjeldahl and the Dumas method indicated that there was no significant difference between them, showing 0.994 of it and 0.956 of p-value. Also, for the nine kinds of meat, five kinds of sea food, three kinds of chemical samples, four kinds of vegetable, there was little difference about the correlation coefficient of the Kjeldahl and the Dumas method, showing 0.9725, 0.9879, 0.9985 and 0.9873 of it and 0.947, 0.761, 0.997 and 0.727 of p-value, respectively. For the samples of meat, they were not fully homogenized, so the reproducibility of them was not good in the Dumas method, which is required to be analyzed in small size. However, when vegetables, which contain a lot of nitrates, are analyzed using Kjeldahl, they showed the lower reproducibility compared to the result of using Dumas because they are not completely decomposed in the Kjeldahl method. In the Dumas method, the samples should be homogenized because only 0.1 g sample is used. In short, neither of the Kjeldahl and Dumas methods are an accurate quantitative test because both of them do not directly analyze pure protein but measure the amount of protein based on analysis of nitrogen. Therefore, it is important of selecting the appropriate analysis method considering the characteristics of samples.",황선혜,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106909274
열중량 분석법에 의한 단일벽 탄소나노튜브의 순도 평가,"This study evaluated the purity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in the arc-synthesized SWCNT samples by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The as-produced SWCNT samples were heat-treated in air for 20 h at 275-475℃ and characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopes and TGA to establish oxidation temperature ranges of SWCNTs and carbonaceous impurities comprising the samples. Based on these oxidation temperature ranges, derivative thermogravimetric curves were deconvoluted, and differentiated peaks were assigned to SWCNTs and carbonaceous impurities. The compositions and the SWCNT purities of the samples were obtained simply by calculating the areal ratios under the deconvoluted curves. TGA studies on purity evaluation and thermal stabilities of SWCNTs and carbonaceous impurities are likely to provide us with a simple route of thermal oxidation purification to acquire high-purity SWCNT samples.",곽정춘 ( Jeung Choon Goak ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99574184
전고체전지용 황화물 고체전해질 습식 합성기술 동향,"The development of non-flammable all-solid-state batteries (ASSLBs) has become a hot topic due to the known drawbacks of commercial lithium-ion batteries. As the possibility of applying sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs) for electric vehicle batteries increases, efforts for the low-cost mass-production are actively underway. Until now, most studies have used highenergy mechanical milling, which is easy to control composition and impurities and can reduce the process time. Through this, various SSEs that exceed the Li+ conductivity of liquid electrolytes have been reported, and expectations for the realization of ASSLBs are growing. However, the high-energy mechanical milling method has disadvantages in obtaining the same physical properties when mass-produced, and in controlling the particle size or shape, so that physical properties deteriorate during the full process. On the other hand, wet chemical synthesis technology, which has advantages in mass production and low price, is still in the initial exploration stage. In this technology, SSEs are mainly manufactured through producing a particle-type, solution-type, or mixed-type precursor, but a clear understanding of the reaction mechanism hasn’t been made yet. In this review, wet chemical synthesis technologies for SSEs are summarized regarding the reaction mechanism between the raw materials in the solvent.",하윤철,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108249162
기기분석을 이용한 한약재로서 석고의 포제법 표준화,"Gypsum, oriental medicine, contains hydrated calcium sulphate [CaSO 4·2H 2 O] as a major compound andhas been used for treating headache of common cold in Korean traditional medicine. However, the safety ofgypsum can not be guaranteed because of not only its unclear origin, but also its unstandardizated pre-treatmentprocess. In the previous paper, we suggested the evaluation technique for gypsum. As a consecutive research,we established the standard pre-treatment processing methods to reduce toxicity and increase safety of Gypsum. In this research, previously confirmed authentic gypsum sample (G18) was selected and used for furtherexperiments. The gypsum sample was heated under microwave and in furnace over various temperature andheating time. The amount of major (Ca, S) and toxic minor elements (As, Cd, Pb and Hg) in before and afterpre-treatment sample were compared for the safety and efficiency evaluation. Dehydration of water in gypsumwhich is the literally known main purpose of processing was efficiently completed within 30 min at high temperature(over 600℃) in a furnace. The weight of Gypsum Preparatum (thermal pre-treated gypsum) wasdecreased nearly 20% after pre-treatment because of water elimination and this naturally increase the % contentsof major elements.

The organic material BOD and COD/TOC was measured from the six to nine different sites of water samples of lake water, branch stream and main stream of the river, and discharged water from public sewage treatment plants. The purpose of this research was to monitor the changes of those characteristics and distribution ratios. In the lake average COD/TOC was as high as 1.95 ± 0.08, and coefficient of correlation of TOC about COD was also as high as 0.894. This result shows that the environmental standards for TOC are in need of enhancement. In the branch and main stream of the river water average concentration of COD was high and the average of COD/TOC was also high in both the branch stream (2.07 ± 0.08) and the main stream (2.28 ± 0.13). This result shows that a necessary step of management was needed against nondegradable organic materials in the Youngsan River. In the discharged water from public sewage treatment plants the average of COD/TOC was as high as 1.84 ± 0.09, and coefficient of correlation of TOC about COD was also as high as 0.789.

In particular, the significant volume change of the active material can deform the electrode structure and easily damage the electron transfer pathway. To improve performance and mitigate electrode damage caused by volume changes, we replaced parts of the carbon black conducting agent with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) having a linear shape. The content of the entire conductive material in the electrode was fixed at 10% by mass, and the relative content of CNTs ranged from 0% to 25% by mass to prepare electrodes and evaluate electrochemical performance. As the CNT content in the electrode increased, both cycle life and rate capability improved. Even a small amount of CNT can significantly improve the electrochemical performance of a c-SiOx negative electrode with large volume changes.

To determine the amount of organic matter, we took 350 samples of drinking water including 146 samples of groundwater, 102 samples of tap water, and 102 samples of spring water. The data of KMnO4 consumption and UV254 absorbance showed a strong positive linear correlation for all of the samples. The TOC concentration and UV254 absorbance data had correlation coefficients of 0.443~0.490 for groundwater, tap water, and spring water. However, the correlation between TOC concentration and KMnO4 consumption data for groundwater was not confirmed. Their correlation was very low for the data of tap water and spring water though they had statistically significant differences with less than 0.05 of p value. We suggest that the drinking water quality standards for UV254 absorbance should be 0.0600 cm-1, as a result of taking account of an allowance of 25% and other countries`` drinking water quality standards.
