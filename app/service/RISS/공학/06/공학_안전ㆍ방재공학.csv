Accordingly, the safety requirements for PM use are being strengthened, but there are still insufficient laws/systems, infrastructure, and management systems for a safe environment. Therefore, in this study, the main problems and improvement methods are comprehensively searched based on the review of previous studies related to PM, and priorities are presented according to the importance of the improvement methods through the Delphi survey. Method: The research method is mainly composed of literature study and expert survey (Delphi survey). Existing prior research and improvement cases (local governments, government departments, companies, etc.) are reviewed to derive problems and improvements, and a problem/improvement classification table is created based on keywords. Based on the classification contents, an expert survey is conducted to derive a priority improvement plan. Result: The PM-related problems were 'non-compliance with traffic laws, lack of knowledge, inexperienced operation, and lack of safety awareness' in relation to human factors, and 'device characteristics, road-drivable space, road facilities, parking facilities' in relation to physical factors. 'Management/supervision, product management, user management, education/training' as administrative factors, and legal factors related to all these factors are divided into 'absence/sufficiency of law, confusion/duplication, reduced effectiveness'. Improvement tasks related to this include 'PM education/public relations, parking/return, road improvement, PM registration/management, insurance, safety standards, traffic standards, PM device safety, PM supplementary facilities, enforcement/management, dedicated organization, service providers, management system, and related laws/institutional improvement', and 42 detailed tasks were derived for these 14 core tasks. As a result of the importance evaluation for detailed tasks, the tasks with an overall high average for the evaluation items of cost, time, effect, urgency, and feasibility were 'strengthening crackdown/instruction activities, education publicity/campaign, truancy PM management, and clarification of traffic rules'. Conclusion: The PM market is gradually growing in size based on shared services, and a safe environment for PM use must be ensured along with industrial revitalization. In this respect, this study is meaningful in that it seeks out the major problems and improvement plans related to PM from a comprehensive point of view and prioritizes the necessary improvement measures, and its value is valuable in that it can serve as a basis of data for future policy establishment. In the future, in-depth data supplementation will be required for each key improvement area for practical policy application.",강성경,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108079915
ESS 화재전용 소화약제 및 소화시스템 개발에 관한 연구,"This paper presents a study on the development of a fire extinguishing agent and extinguishing system for an energystorage system (ESS) fire. The fire extinguishing agent designed to extinguish an ESS fire is a highly permeable fireextinguisher that reduces the surface tension and viscosity while bringing about cooling action. This is the mainextinguishing effect of this type of wetting agent, which displays the characteristics of fire extinguishing agents used forpenetrating the battery cells inside the ESS module. For the fire extinguishing system, a local application system wasdesigned to suppress fire on a rack-by-rack basis. A 360° rotating nozzle was inserted into the rear hall of the ESS module,and general nozzles were installed in the rack to maximize the fire extinguishing effect. The fire extinguishing agent wasstrongly discharged by virtue of the gas release pressure. Experiments on fire suppression performance with ESS module1 unit and module 3 units showed that all visible flames were extinguished in 8 s and 9 s, respectively, by the fireextinguishing agent. In addition, based on confirming reignition for 600 s after the fire extinguishing agent was exhausted,it was confirmed that the ESS fire was completely extinguished without reignition in all fire suppression performanceexperiments.",이연호(Yeon-Ho Lee),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106816826

기후변화 관련 자연재해가 우리나라의 쌀 생산에 미치는 영향,"Climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. Consequently, climate change influences agricultural production and threatens food security. This study investigates the impact of climate related natural disasters on rice production. Step-wise multiple regressions were conducted using the data of natural disasters, rice paddy areas, and rice production for the period of ten years from 2008 to 2017. The results show that the change in rice production in relation to the average of the past three years was influenced by the rice paddy areas, typhoons, gales, and torrents, i.e. an individual year's rice production was explained by these variables. All natural disaster variables have a negative impact on the average rice production over the past three years and on the rice production for each year. With respect to the prospect of rice production, the rice paddy areas play greater roles in the production capacity than natural disasters.
