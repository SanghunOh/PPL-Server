This study investigates the influence of four behavioral types in MBTI (Myer-Briggs Type Indicator) and working conditions on organizational effectiveness. Job satisfaction and immersion have been regarded as a key conception of organizational effectiveness. The focus of this study is to investigate the effects of R&D employee's four behavioral types in MBTI and working conditions on organizational effectiveness. The results of this study show that organizational effectiveness is influenced by personality types and working conditions. According to the result, First, about the analysis of differences in job satisfaction, EP (Extraversion Perceiving)-type (3.56) and EJ (Extraversion Judging)-type (3.43) are higher than IJ (Introversion Judging)-type (3.07) and IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type (3.03) of four behavioral types in MBTI. So an enterprise makes various efforts to enhance job satisfaction for IJ (Introversion Judging)-type and IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type. Second, For improving the organizational effectiveness that is job satisfaction and immersion, an enterprise must make favorable working conditions to each four behavioral types in MBTI of R&D employees. In order to improve job satisfaction, the enterprise will provide IJ (Introversion Judging)-type with support for collegiality and IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type with good relationships with superiors. and also the enterprise gives autonomic authority to EJ (Extraversion Judging)-type. Finally, in the case of EP (Extraversion Perceiving)-type, the enterprise must admit failure for efforts. In order to improve job immersion, the enterprise will provide IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type with good relationships with superiors, the vision of company and compensation for creative work. and also the enterprise gives autonomic authority to EJ (Extraversion Judging)-type.",박정운,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60243403

ESG 평가방법 비교: K-ESG 가이드라인을 중심으로,"ESG management is becoming a necessity of the times, but there are about 600 ESG evaluation indicators worldwide, causing confusion in the market as different ESG ratings were assigned to individual companies according to evaluation agencies. In addition, since the method of applying ESG was not disclosed, there were not many ways for companies that wanted to introduce ESG management to get help. Accordingly, the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced the K-ESG guideline jointly with the ministries. In previous studies, there were few studies on the comparison of evaluation grades by ESG evaluation company or the application of evaluation diagnostic items. Therefore, in this study, the ease of application and improvement of the K-ESG guideline was attempted by applying the K-ESG guideline to companies that already have ESG ratings. The position of the K-ESG guideline is also confirmed by comparing the scores calculated through the K-ESG guideline for companies that have ESG ratings from global ESG evaluation agencies and domestic ESG evaluation agencies. As a result of the analysis, first, the K-ESG guideline provide clear and detailed standards for individual companies to set their own ESG goals and set the direction of ESG practice. Second, the K-ESG guideline is suitable for domestic and global ESG evaluation standards as it has 61 diagnostic items and 12 additional diagnostic items covering the evaluation indicators of global representative ESG evaluation agencies and KCGS in Korea. Third, the ESG rating of the K-ESG guideline was higher than that of a global ESG rating company and lower than or similar to that of a domestic ESG rating company. Fourth, the ease of application of the K-ESG guideline is judged to be high. Fifth, the point to be improved in the K-ESG guideline is that the government needs to compile industry average statistics on diagnostic items in the K-ESG environment area and publish them on the government’s ESG-only site. In addition, the applied weights of E, S, and G by industry should be determined and disclosed. This study will help ESG evaluation agencies, corporate management, and ESG managers interested in ESG management in establishing ESG management strategies and contributing to providing improvements to be referenced when revising the K-ESG guideline in the future.",조찬희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108535935

간호사의 환자안전문화인식이 환자안전간호활동에 미치는 영향：안전통제감의 조절 및 매개효과,"The purpose of this study is to examine degree patient safety culture perception, safety control, and patient safety nursing activities of nurses and to verify moderating and mediating effects of safety control in the effect of safety culture perception on patient safety nursing activities. This is a descriptive research study and data was collected from July 26 to August 26 in 2021. The subject were 144 nurses who understood the purpose of study and had worked more 6 months. In this study, the patient safety culture perception, safety control, patient safety nursing activities of nurses were used self-reporting questionnaires.
The collected data was analyzed by frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, Pearson’s correlation coefficients and hierarchical multiple regression using SPSS WIN 26.0 program. Patient safety nursing activities had a significant positive correlation with patient safety culture perception(r=.30, p<0.001), and safety control (r=.31, p<0.001). Between patient safety culture perception and safety control had a significant positive correlation(r=.56, p<0.001).

언어모델을 활용한 콘텐츠 메타 데이터 기반 유사 콘텐츠 추천 모델,"With the increase in the spread of smart devices and the impact of COVID-19, the consumption of media contents through smart devices has significantly increased. Along with this trend, the amount of media contents viewed through OTT platforms is increasing, that makes contents recommendations on these platforms more important. Previous contents-based recommendation researches have mostly utilized metadata that describes the characteristics of the contents, with a shortage of researches that utilize the contents’ own descriptive metadata. In this paper, various text data including titles and synopses that describe the contents were used to recommend similar contents. KLUE-RoBERTa-large, a Korean language model with excellent performance, was used to train the model on the text data. A dataset of over 20,000 contents metadata including titles, synopses, composite genres, directors, actors, and hash tags information was used as training data. To enter the various text features into the language model, the features were concatenated using special tokens that indicate each feature. The test set was designed to promote the relative and objective nature of the model’s similarity classification ability by using the three contents comparison method and applying multiple inspections to label the test set. Genres classification and hash tag classification prediction tasks were used to fine-tune the embeddings for the contents meta text data. As a result, the hash tag classification model showed an accuracy of over 90% based on the similarity test set, which was more than 9% better than the baseline language model. Through hash tag classification training, it was found that the language model’s ability to classify similar contents was improved, which demonstrated the value of using a language model for the contents-based filtering.",김동환,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108535938

CNN-LSTM 조합모델을 이용한 영화리뷰 감성분석,"Rapid growth of internet technology and social media is progressing. Data mining technology has evolved to enable unstructured document representations in a variety of applications. Sentiment analysis is an important technology that can distinguish poor or high-quality content through text data of products, and it has proliferated during text mining. Sentiment analysis mainly analyzes people's opinions in text data by assigning predefined data categories as positive and negative. This has been studied in various directions in terms of accuracy from simple rule-based to dictionary-based approaches using predefined labels. In fact, sentiment analysis is one of the most active researches in natural language processing and is widely studied in text mining. When real online reviews aren't available for others, it's not only easy to openly collect information, but it also affects your business. In marketing, real-world information from customers is gathered on websites, not surveys. Depending on whether the website's posts are positive or negative, the customer response is reflected in the sales and tries to identify the information. However, many reviews on a website are not always good, and difficult to identify. The earlier studies in this research area used the reviews data of the Amazon.com shopping mal, but the research data used in the recent studies uses the data for stock market trends, blogs, news articles, weather forecasts, IMDB, and facebook etc. However, the lack of accuracy is recognized because sentiment calculations are changed according to the subject, paragraph, sentiment lexicon direction, and sentence strength. This study aims to classify the polarity analysis of sentiment analysis into positive and negative categories and increase the prediction accuracy of the polarity analysis using the pretrained IMDB review data set. First, the text classification algorithm related to sentiment analysis adopts the popular machine learning algorithms such as NB (naive bayes), SVM (support vector machines), XGboost, RF (random forests), and Gradient Boost as comparative models.
Second, deep learning has demonstrated discriminative features that can extract complex features of data. Representative algorithms are CNN (convolution neural networks), RNN (recurrent neural networks), LSTM (long-short term memory). CNN can be used similarly to BoW when processing a sentence in vector format, but does not consider sequential data attributes. RNN can handle well in order because it takes into account the time information of the data, but there is a long-term dependency on memory. To solve the problem of long-term dependence, LSTM is used. For the comparison, CNN and LSTM were chosen as simple deep learning models. In addition to classical machine learning algorithms, CNN, LSTM, and the integrated models were analyzed. Although there are many parameters for the algorithms, we examined the relationship between numerical value and precision to find the optimal combination. And, we tried to figure out how the models work well for sentiment analysis and how these models work. This study proposes integrated CNN and LSTM algorithms to extract the positive and negative features of text analysis. The reasons for mixing these two algorithms are as follows. CNN can extract features for the classification automatically by applying convolution layer and massively parallel processing. LSTM is not capable of highly parallel processing. Like faucets, the LSTM has input, output, and forget gates that can be moved and controlled at a desired time. These gates have the advantage of placing memory blocks on hidden nodes. The memory block of the LSTM may not store all the data, but it can solve the CNN's long-term dependency problem. Furthermore, when LSTM is used in CNN's pooling layer, it has an end-to-end structure, so that spatial and temporal features can be designed simultaneously. In combination with CNN-LSTM, 90.33% accuracy was measured. Thi...",박호연,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106499357

철도 유휴부지 활용방안: 군집분석을 활용한 태양광발전 입지 제안,"Due to unprecedented extreme weather events such as global warming and climate change, many parts of the world suffer from severe pain, and economic losses are also snowballing. In order to address these problems, ‘The Paris Agreement’ was signed in 2016, and an intergovernmental consultative body was formed to keep the average temperature rise of the Earth below 1.5°C. Korea also declared ‘Carbon Neutrality in 2050’ to prevent climate catastrophe. In particular, it was found that the increase in temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions hurts the environment and society as a whole, as well as the export-dependent economy of Korea. In addition, as the diversification of transportation types is accelerating, the change in means of choice is also increasing. As the development paradigm in the low-growth era changes to urban regeneration, interest in idle railway sites is rising due to reduced demand for routes, improvement of alignment, and relocation of urban railways. Meanwhile, it is possible to partially achieve the solar power generation goal of ‘Renewable Energy 3020’ by utilizing already developed but idle railway sites and take advantage of being free from environmental damage and resident acceptance issues surrounding the location; but the actual use and plan for these solar power facilities are still lacking. Therefore, in this study, using the big data provided by the Korea National Railway and the Renewable Energy Cloud Platform, we develop an algorithm to discover and analyze suitable idle sites where solar power generation facilities can be installed and identify potentially applicable areas considering conditions desired by users. By searching and deriving these idle but relevant sites, it is intended to devise a plan to save enormous costs for facilities or expansion in the early stages of development. This study uses various cluster analyses to develop an optimal algorithm that can derive solar power plant locations on idle railway sites and, as a result, suggests 202 ‘actively recommended areas.’ These results would help decision-makers make rational decisions from the viewpoint of simultaneously considering the economy and the environment.",강은경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108535945
Simulation Modeling for Production Scheduling under Make-To-Order Production Environment : Focusing on the Flat Glass Production Environment,"The manufacturing companies under Make-To-Order (MTO) production environment face highly variable requirements of the customers. It makes them difficult to establish preemptive production strategy through inventory management and demand forecasting. Therefore, the ability to establish an optimal production schedule that incorporates the various requirements of the customers is emphasized as the key success factor. In this study, we suggest a process of designing the simulation model for establishing production schedule and apply this model to the case of a flat glass processing company. The flat glass manufacturing industry is under MTO production environment. Academic research of flat glass industry is focused on minimizing the waste in the cutting process. In addition, in the practical view, the flat glass manufacturing companies tend to establish the production schedule based on the intuition of production manager and it results in failure of meeting the due date. Based on these findings, the case study aims to present the process of drawing up a production schedule through simulation modeling. The actual data of Korean flat glass processing company were used to make a monthly production schedule. To do this, five scenarios based on dispatching rules are considered and each scenario is evaluated by three key performance indicators for delivery compliance.

Real stream data from sensors in this area is collected. Among 2,728 data sets collected, 2,632 sets are used for modelling and 96 sets are used for testing. The shows that neural network is better than multiple regression analysis in their prediction performance.",안지훈,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102490188
온도와 분자량에 따른 기체 확산속도 측정,"Generally, diffusion coefficient is a function of temperature and molecular weight of gas molecules. In this study, diffusion coefficients of methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol and n-propyl alcohol were measured in air by varying system temperature. Mass transfer apparatus for measureing gaseous diffusivity was used for the experimental investigation. Temperatures were 30℃, 40℃, 50℃, and diffusion coefficients for each temperature were obtained. As a result, gaseous diffusion coefficients increase with increasing the system temperature. However, the diffusion coefficient decreases as the molecular weight of liquid increases. It was found that liquid vapor pressure and gaseous diffusion coefficient has a general trend: the diffusion coefficient is increasing with increasing vapor pressure.",강태규 ( Tae Kyu Kang ),2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75669975
평생교육기관 교육서비스품질이 성인학습자의 취업준비행동에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of the educational service quality of lifelong
education institutions on the job preparation behavior of adult learners, and to suggest important factors that
enhance the job preparation behavior of adult learners and ways to contribute to the improvement of educational
service quality.
Methods: In this study, 260 adult learners using lifelong educational institutions located in Seoul and
Gyeonggi-do were statistically analyzed with SPSS 22.0 as a study sample.
Results: First, lecturer expertise, educational environment, educational programs, and administrative services
of instructors, which are sub-factors of educational service quality, were all adopted as positive (+) influences
on educational satisfaction. Second, the lecturer expertise and educational programs were adopted due to
the positive (+) effect on job search efficacy, but the educational environment and administrative services
were rejected. Third, educational satisfaction was adopted as a positive (+) effect on job search efficacy.
Fourth, educational satisfaction was adopted as a positive (+) effect on job preparation behavior. Fifth, job
search efficacy was adopted as a positive effect on job preparation behavior.
Conclusion: Based on the research results, it suggests that educational satisfaction and job search efficacy
are important variables for adult learners using lifelong education institutions, and provides basic data on
variables necessary to increase their job effectiveness in a rapidly changing job environment.",길민재,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108518676
로컬푸드의 성장요인 분석,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to identify the success factor of local food markets compared to other types of markets such as large discount stores.
Methods: SWOT analysis was conducted. In addition to the analysis, we also have interviewed the local farmers and retailers to elaborate the analysis results.
Results: The study shows the success factors to the local markets are minimizing the stages of distribution channels, shortening the travel distance from producers to consumers, providing fresh foods, maintaining small amount of production system, and supporting customers.
Conclusion: Customer satisfaction is one of the key factors for the successful growth of local food markets. It is strongly recommend to find strategic ways of meeting customer needs since the local food markets are facing tough competition form the large retail stores armed with huge amount of capitals and infrastructures.",윤장원(Jangwon Yoon),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101987353
CSR·CSV·ESG 연구 동향 분석 - 빅데이터 분석을 중심으로 -,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present implications by analyzing research trends on CSR, CSV
and ESG by text analysis and visual analysis(Comprehensive/ Fields / Years-based) which are big data analyses,
by collecting data based on previous studies on CSR, CSV and ESG.
Methods: For the collection of analysis data, deep learning was used in the integrated search on the Academic
Research Information Service (www.riss.kr) to search for ""CSR"", ""CSV"" and ""ESG"" as search terms, and the
Korean abstracts and keyword were scrapped out of the extracted paper and they are organize into EXCEL.
For the final step, CSR 2,847 papers, CSV 395 papers, ESG 555 papers derived were analyzed using the
Rx64 4.0.2 program and Rstudio using text mining, one of the big data analysis techniques, and Word Cloud
for visualization.
Results: The results of this study are as follows; CSR, CSV, and ESG studies showed that research slowed
down somewhat before 2010, but research increased rapidly until recently in 2019. Research have been found
to be heavily researched in the fields of social science, art and physical education, and engineering. As a
result of the study, there were many keyword of 'corporate', 'social', and 'responsibility', which were similar
in the word cloud analysis. Looking at the frequent keyword and word cloud analysis by field and year, overall
keyword were derived similar to all keyword by year. However, some differences appeared in each field.
Conclusion: Government support and expert support for CSR, CSV and ESG should be activated, and researches
on technology-based strategies are needed. In the future, it is necessary to take various approaches to them.
If researches are conducted in consideration of the environment or energy, it is judged that bigger implications
can be presented.",이은지,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108385618
