혈액암을 표적으로 한 키메라항원수용체-T 세포 (CAR-T) 치료법,"Immunotherapy has demonstrated significant potential for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Among the many immunotherapy treatments, chimeric antigen receptor-T cell (CAR-T) therapy is the most promising treatment. The CAR-T cell is an effector T cell that recognizes and eliminates specific cancer cells, independent of major histocompatibility complex molecules. Currently, CAR-T therapy has many successful clinical results for hematologic malignancies. However, CAR-T has side effects and limits on anti-cancer effectiveness and persistence. Thus, a new CAR-T model is being developed to improve these problems. Although the new CAR-T model still needs more clinical trials, recent clinical trials have reported improvements over traditional CAR-T.",박현모(Hyunmo Park),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107089709

차광처리에 따른 후박나무 용기묘의 생리 및 생장 반응,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the growth characteristics and physiological responses of Machilus thunbergii containerseedlings under full sunlight, 35%, 55%, and 75% shading levels. In shade treatments, indices indicating aboveground growth characteristicstended to be relatively high, whereas in full sunlight, root-related indicators such as root weight ratio and root growth tended to besignificantly higher. Furthermore, the low light compensation point and high apparent quantum yield in full sunlight indicate that M.
thunbergii already has shade tolerance, and it can be seen that the vitality of the photosynthetic apparatus is efficiently increased byreducing dark respiration and increasing PIABS and SFIABS in shade treatments exposed to a light-sufficient environment. Meanwhile,the full sunlight treatment showed an increase in the aboveground part ratio, a low T/R ratio, and the highest net photosynthetic rate,denoting that carbohydrates synthesized by photosynthesis increased the growth of both the aboveground and underground parts.

차세대 감염병 백신,"Viral infectious diseases have been regarded as one of the greatest threats to global public health. The recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a stark reminder of the threat posed by emerging viral infections. Developing and producing appropriate and efficient vaccines and therapeutics are the only options to combat this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for novel vaccine platforms to control and prevent emerging viral diseases. Conventional vaccine platforms, including live-attenuated vaccine and inactivated vaccines, pose limitations in the speed of vaccine development, manufacturing capacity, and broad protection for emergency use. Interestingly, vaccination with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate based on the mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform protected against COVID-19, confirming that the nucleoside-modified candidate is a safe and effective alternative to conventional vaccines. Moreover, the prophylactic strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic have been mRNA nucleic acid-based vaccines and nanoparticle-based platforms, which are effective against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. Overall, the novel vaccine platform has presented advantages compared with the traditional vaccine platform in the COVID-19 pandemic.

중추신경계 질환의 진단과 치료를 위한 엑소좀의 활용,"Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle containing proteins and messenger and microRNAs; they are secreted by all cell types. Once released, exosomes are selectively taken up by other cells adjacent or at a distance, releasing their contents and reprogramming the target cells. Since exosomes are natural vesicles produced by cells as small sizes, it is generally accepted that exosomes have a non-toxic nature and non-immunogenic behaviors. Recently, exosomes have elicited scientific attention as drug delivery vehicles to the central nervous system. The central nervous system has a blood-brain barrier that makes it difficult for drugs to penetrate. Thus, the blood-brain barrier has been a major obstacle to the development of drugs for treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes can cross the blood-brain barrier primarily through transcytosis. Consequently, exosomes are expected to become a new delivery vehicle that can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver drugs into the brain parenchyma. In addition, since different types of exosomes are secreted depending on the cell type and disease state, exosomes can also be utilized as biomarkers for the diagnosis of diseases in the central nervous system. In this review, we summarized recent research trends on exosomes, including clinical trials as biomarkers and treatment options for diseases in the central nervous system.",박지아,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108758324
암 치료를 위한 항체치료제에 대한 고찰: 면역항암제,"Recently, biopharmaceutical drugs take a big part in the pharmaceutical market with the development of genetic engineering. Therapeutic antibodies, one of the representative biopharmaceuticals, have strong therapeutic efficacy in various diseases such as autoimmune disease, rheumatism and cancer. Antibodies are widely used as targeted delivery systems, diagnostics and therapeutics because of their high specific recognition ability. In addition, the market for therapeutic antibodies is expanding further with the development of new biologic drugs such as biosimilar and biobetter. In particular, cancer immunotherapy has shown excellent efficacy for the treatment of cancer by regulating the immune response. In recent years, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), immune checkpoint inhibitors and therapeutic antibodies have been developed by many researchers and pharmaceutical companies and approved by U.S. food and drug administration as a potential strategy for the treatment of cancer. Although cancer immunotherapy has a strong therapeutic efficacy, there are still limitations to overcome such as for the treatment of solid tumor, immunogenicity and resistance. To solve these problems, new biomarkers, bispecific antibodies and combinatorial therapy with chemotherapy are being investigated.

메일라드 반응과 노화,"It is obvious that the Maillard reaction, also called glycation or non-enzymatic glycosylation of proteins by carbohydrates, is related with molecular and cellular lesion in aging and age-related diseases. Aging is characterized by progressive, irreversible and deleterious changes in tissue function. Some of the most pronounced changes occur in tissues with long-lived proteins such as in the extra and intracellular matrix, the lens and the brain. Most of these changes are dramatically worsened by diabetes. By and large, most of the changes observed in aging occur twice faster in diabetes. The importance of the Maillard reaction in aging of living organisms has been appreciated only recently. In the advanced stage of this reaction, advanced glycation endproducts(AGEs) accumulate in tissues as a function of time and sugar concentration. AGEs also induce permanent abnormalities in extra and intracellular matrix component function, stimulate cytokine and reactive oxygen species production through AGE-specific receptors, and modify intracellular proteins.",신동범,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2021116
근육 골격계의 질환 및 재활분석(수영선수를 중심으로),"While swimming is a very popular competitive sports activity, swimming injuries are unique due to the repetitive nature of the swimming stroke and demanding training programs that can result in upper limb overuse. Therefore, the primary objective of this review was to analyze swimmers' injury areas, injury types by stroke type, and swimming rehabilitation, as well as to discuss safety management for improving swimming performance. In this study, the injuries incurred in swimming events were discussed in the order of upper limb injuries (neck, shoulder, arm, and wrist), lower limb injuries (knee and ankle), and waist injuries. An analysis by stroke type found that shoulder injuries occurred most often with freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly strokes, followed by rotator cuff injury, impingement syndrome, and SLAP (superior labral tear from anterior to posterior) lesions. Knee injuries were associated with the breaststroke, whereas spinal cord injuries occurred with the breaststroke and butterfly stroke. Finally, back injuries were associated with the butterfly stroke. During the freestyle stroke, the shoulder undergoes repetitive overhead movement; hence, shoulder and musculoskeletal pain are the most common and well-documented complaints of swimmers. For safety management, coaches and instructors must ensure that athletes do sufficient warm-up and cool-down exercises to avoid injuries. In case of an injury, they should be familiar with first aid measures so that secondary damage can be prevented with its quick application. In addition, coaches and instructors need to be trained in injury prevention and treatment so that they can provide appropriate rehabilitation treatment for athletes. Although swimming-related injuries cannot be completely eliminated, to reduce them to a minimum, leaders need the knowledge to apply scientific and systematic training principles and methods individualized for each athlete.",김귀백,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108212250
