Among them, companies' participation in RE100 and progress status are not just corporate problems but are also interested in social and political fields. So, we investigated the implementation method of RE100 to inform this situation and suggest a better direction. In addition, the current status of global RE100 and Korean RE100 was analyzed, and based on this, the institutional problems of RE100 were raised. In addition, to solve these problems, we proposed an improvement plan that supplemented the concerns of overseas REC purchases and direct PPA, suggesting the institutional direction that Korea should move forward to realize RE100.",이민혁,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108533774
전기차 폐배터리 진단/해체 기술 동향 및 향후 친환경적 개발 전략,"Owing to the increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), appropriate management of their waste batteries is required urgently for scrapped vehicles or for addressing battery aging. With respect to technological developments, data-driven diagnosis of waste EV batteries and management technologies have drawn increasing attention. Moreover, robot-based automatic dismantling technologies, which are seemingly interesting, require industrial verifications and linkages with future battery-related database systems. Among these, it is critical to develop and disseminate various advanced battery diagnosis and assessment techniques to improve the efficiency and safety/environment of the recirculation of waste batteries. Incorporation of lithium-related chemical substances in the public pollutant release and transfer register (PRTR) database as well as in-depth risk assessment of gas emissions in waste EV battery combustion and their relevant fire safety are some of the necessary steps.
Further research and development thus are needed for optimizing the lifecycle management of waste batteries from various aspects related to data-based diagnosis/classification/disassembly processes as well as reuse/recycling and final disposal. The idea here is that the data should contribute to clean design and manufacturing to reduce the environmental burden and facilitate reuse/recycling in future production of EV batteries. Such optimization should also consider the future technological and market trends.",변채은,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108245004

Especially in the case of disabled children, the disability may result in causing serious problems of reduction in much potentialities they deserve in the early stage of development. Children's disability includes trauma of cerebral palsy, spinabifida, neurogical, spiral cord, and brain impairments, etc. The problem of theses disabilities arise in muscle motors such as fine-and gross-motor skills, the coordination as visual motor cooperation, or in cognition of maintaining the concentration ability, or of long and short memorizings. Various alternative therapies must be needed for the children in order to gain their rehabilitation and social restoration influences, and are recently common in the United States. Horticultural therapy being one of them is known to have noted benefits for the disabled with multi-motor skills, responsibility for taking care of raising plants, cognitive skills of self-esteem, and motivation. Horticultural therapy either alone in combination with other alternative means as music or pet therapy for the disabled children have also been documented often, and known to increase subscaling in depression, hyperactivity, social interaction, depression, anxiety and intellectual screening.

1. It is necessary to improve the appraisal system for how radiation environmental impact assessment in the preparatory stage, when the nuclear power plant is under construction. The administrative agency should take the charge of making out the evaluation of the influence of radiation and be able to gather not only the opinions of civil environmental entities. It should read just system to observe the content of the environmental impact assessment.
2. Of course the neighboring residents are at odds with the mobilized construction crew due to the bad effects of noise, vibration, dust and so on during construction and they are concerned about their health due to accumulated bad effect.
Consequently, we need to analyze whether we should keep to a strict the level of radiation discharge or not.
3. The atomic waste does not come under the rule of waste countrol but of atomic energy control. Due to the insufficiency of regulations about the safty of atomic waste and proper management, it is necessary to have stricter atomic waste control administration.
4. There are no regulations on heat pollution under our environmental law at this time. Therefore, we need legislation about heat pollution incruding the matter of discharge water from an nuclear power plant.

지구환경문제와 국제 협력의 방향,"ABSTRACT

What is special about the outcome of the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) is that it was not an outcome at all, but the beginning of a new process. Although another process exactly like UNCED will probably not happen again for a very long time, UNCED spawned sub-regimes - in desertification, biodiversity, forestry, and other areas - where the lessons learned from the umbrella negotiations could be applied meaningfully.

In this paper, the expansion of global interdependence is briefly reviewed as an introduction; then new international cooperations the global environment concerning river problems, acid rain, protection of stratospheric ozone, protection of wild fauna and flora, ocean, and global warming plus UNCED are considered as typical examples. Patterns and areas of international cooperation are also outlined and the trends of such cooperations are chronologically considered, namely, 1960s, 1970s, the first half of 1980s and the second half of 1980s and thereafter, etc. International cooperation in the global environment era is considered as a concluding remark with the potential role of UNCED.",신현덕,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2115284

세계 주요 원전운용국가들의 핵폐기물 문제와 핵폐기물 정책의 변화,"Nuclear waste is a serious environmental problem in search of policy solution. In many ways, nuclear waste policy may be described as a ""new kid"" of environmental policy, In the early stages of nuclear development, scientists and policy makers alike assumed that such waste could be easily managed through deep geological disposal. Also, most individuals involved in nuclear program were more interested in the development of new technology than in the seemingly unproductive question of waste disposal. However, with the spread of nuclear technology to commercial and industrial applications, the level of nuclear waste began to grow exponently. Nuclear waste management became an important item on the public policy agenda of those nations utilizing the nuclear technology. Ironically, then, serious public policy concern for nuclear wastes management is less than two decades old. Thus, the policy process in mostcountries, including the U.S., is still in development stage. General nuclear waste policy worldwide has been slow In developing. Actually recognition of a need for a policy response, even to a problem with the ramifications of nuclear waste, does not necessarily translate into viable policy. Thus the world faces a serious problem of nuclear waste without an adequate waste management policy. In this paper, the author tries to review the U.S. nuclear waste management policy which is characterized by the development states from complacency, to belated policy response, to policy paralysis and stalemate. The author argues that we can learn from the policy stalemate in the U.S. with the hindsight of the late-comer's effect, we can understand the difficulty and nature of the nuclear waste management problems that are at the present face. Then, the author tries to find the possibility of anticipating the problem and developing a policy response in advance of a nuclear waste crisis in Korea.

This has resulted in an increase in battery production, which in turn leads to future concerns regarding the disposal of used batteries. In this study, lithium was recoverd preferentially from the cathode material of discarded LFP(LiFePO4) batteries. We conducted the extractions of lithium in 2 ways. One is the conventional leaching method which was reacted with sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) aqueous solution. The other is the mechanochemical method which was milled with sodium persulfate powder, followed by water leaching with distilled water. We compared and analyzed the leaching efficiency and characteristics of the major elements using these two methods. In the conventional leaching method, the solid-liquid ratio was set as a variable, and in the mechanochemical leaching method, the amount of hydrogen peroxide(H2O2) was used as a variable. In both methods used in this study, lithium could be pre-leached from about 90% to 100%, and the selectivity of lithium could be improved by controlling the leaching of iron by adding hydrogen peroxide.",김보람,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2111420

The laundry wastes originate from the use soap, soda and synthetic detergents. These are used for removing grease, dirt and starch from solid clothes. In paticular, the synthetic detergents are heavily used for washing the foods and household appliances.
Most commercial laundry wastes are discharged directly to municipal sewage system and treaed together with domestic sewage. Laundry wastes, when float on the surface of water discharged, are serious pollutants. The effects of these substances are toxic. Floating substances with water contribute to decrease BOD(Biochemical Oxygen Demand), which is the main sources of poor water quality. As a result of this, the living organisms are non-survival.
To safely remove these polluting substances, they must be treated most economically by the chemical and physical processes. The first is to remove phosphate(PO₄) with Na₂Al₂O₄, followed by sedimentation and separation process. The second method is the acidiification with FeCl₂,FeCl₃,FeSO₄,Fe(SO₃)₃,followed by sedimentation with ferric sulfate. It is then separated with filtering process.

The delphi technique was applied to identify their risk perception towards some specific items related with pollution. A standardized questionnaire on environmental problems and their priorities was used to 74 subjects. In the questionnaire, the environmental problems were divided into the general ones, 9 items, and the specific ones, 30 items. Also, the perception was associated with two points of view which were the risk on general human health or ecosystem, and on the present situation in Korea. The priority of risk from general environmental problems on human health or ecosystem was analyzed in the order of `water pollution', `air pollution', `soil contamination', `waste', `toxic chemical pollutants', `food contamination', `ocean contamination', `odor pollution', and 'noise pollution'. The priority of risk on the present situation in Korea was analyzed in the order of 'water pollution', 'air pollution', 'waste', 'toxic chemical pollutants', 'food contamination', 'soil contamination', 'ocean contamination', 'odor pollution', and 'noise pollution'. And these priorities were significantly related with the characteristics of respondents such as sex, age, and major concerned area. However, for the first five priorities of risk from the specific environmental problems on human health or ecosystem, the environmental professionals agreed with 'automotive vehicle exhaust', 'domestic and industrial source pollutants to surface water', 'CO₂ and global warming effect', 'toxic air pollutant', and 'industrial source air pollution'.

한반도 기후변화 적응 대상 식물 종풍부도 변화 예측 연구,"This study was designed to predict the changes in species richness of plants under the climate change in South Korea. The target species were selected based on the Plants Adaptable to Climate Change in the Korean Peninsula. Altogether, 89 species including 23 native plants, 30 northern plants, and 36 southern plants. We used the Species Distribution Model to predict the potential habitat of individual species under the climate change. We applied ten single-model algorithms and the pre-evaluation weighted ensemble method. And then, species richness was derived from the results of individual species. Two representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) were used to simulate the species richness of plants in 2050 and 2070. The current species richness was predicted to be high in the national parks located in the Baekdudaegan mountain range in Gangwon Province and islands of the South Sea. The future species richness was predicted to be lower in the national park and the Baekdudaegan mountain range in Gangwon Province and to be higher for southern coastal regions. The average value of the current species richness showed that the national park area was higher than the whole area of South Korea.
However, predicted species richness were not the difference between the national park area and the whole area of South Korea. The difference between current and future species richness of plants could be the disappearance of a large number of native and northern plants from South Korea. The additional reason could be the expansion of potential habitat of southern plants under climate change. However, if species dispersal to a suitable habitat was not achieved, the species richness will be reduced drastically. The results were different depending on whether species were dispersed or not. This study will be useful for the conservation planning, establishment of the protected area, restoration of biological species and strategies for adaptation of climate change.",신만석,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82583587

In light of circumstantial evidence, the process of urban formation seems to have proceeded in a scalar ways rather than being completed in a short period of time. Central function were added to the nascent urban landscape to the effect of bringing life to the city around 100 B.C. The urban society as a whole consisted of several differentiated units of land planned in such a way that public facilities and temples lied within a short distance from the Forums and stores along the main boulevard. Residential region itself was divided into the zone of lower class nearby central Forum and zone of high class on both sides of main street leading ti the gate of castle. The clustering of residences of the urban elite is taken to be a spatial scheme to seal the possibility of power game among the leading groups. The location and pattern of thirty-eight neighborhoods in Pompeii might be associated with the layout of public fountains for running water.

Methods: This study used data from the 8th Panel Study on Korean Children in 2015. For the final study, 1598 cases were used. Wheezing as an asthma symptom was self-reported as an outcome variable. Whether children had owned dogs or cats or not was used as an independent variable. Results: A total of 6.8% of children lived with dogs and 2.1% of children lived with cats in their homes. There were 4.0% of children who had asthma symptoms in the past year. When comparing ‘children who had owned dogs for more than 12 months’ with ‘children who had not owned dogs’, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for ‘asthma symptoms’ were 1.20 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10-1.30) among male children and 2.19 (95% CI, 1.94-2.46) among female children. When comparing ‘children who had owned cats for more than 12 months’ with ‘children who had not owned cats’, the adjusted ORs for ‘asthma symptoms’ were 38.94 (95% CI, 35.55-42.65) among male children and 5.32 (95% CI, 4.60-6.16) among female children. When comparing ‘children who had owned both dogs and cats for more than 12 months’ with ‘children who had not owned at all’, the adjusted OR for ‘asthma symptoms’ was 13.22 (95% CI, 11.93-14.65), and when comparing ‘children who had owned cats only’ with ‘children who had not owned at all’, the adjusted OR for ‘asthma symptoms’ was 9.25 (95% CI, 8.50-10.08). Conclusions: As a result, children s asthma symptoms were higher in the case of cats than with dogs, and in the case of cats, boys were more at risk than girls. In the analysis for the risk of asthma symptoms when a dog and a cat are raised at the same time, it was statistically confirmed that the children in the home were more at risk than with single animal ownership.

청소년의 궐련형 전자담배 현재 사용에 따른 관련 요인 분석,"Background: The use of heated tobacco products (HTP) causes many adverse health effects. Although the use of HTP by adolescents is prevalent worldwide, research related to it is very limited. There is a considerable lack of research related to the current HTP use rather than ever-HTP use. In particular, research related to predictive factors for current HTP use in adolescents is scarce.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to analyze related characteristics according to the current use of HTP among South Korean adolescents.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that used data from the Seventeenth Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBWS). A total of 54,848 students in 2021 were included in this study. Chi-squaretest, multiple logistic regression analysis, and chi-square test for trend were used for analyzing related characteristics according to use of HTP.

Results: Overall, 715 (1.3%) students responded as having used HTP during the last 30 days among the 54,848 students. It was found that residence type, subjective body type recognition, subjective health recognition, alcohol use, habitual drug experience, close friend current smoking, and conventional cigarette smoking were significantly associated characteristics with the current use of heated tobacco products. Comparing ‘very thin recognition’ with ‘very fat recognition’, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 1.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29~2.87) for current use of HTP. Additionally, comparing ‘very unhealthy recognition’ with ‘very healthy recognition’, the aOR was 3.82 (95% CI: 2.40~6.07) for current use of HTP.

Conclusions: Based on these results, residence type, subjective body type recognition, subjective health recognition, alcohol use, habitual drug experience, close friend current smoking, and conventional cigarette smoking were associated with significantly increased odds of current HTP use. Therefore, the results of this study can provide useful evidence about adolescent behaviors in predicting current HTP use.",조준호(Jun Ho Cho),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108271084
Jar - Test 를 이용한 응집제 주입율 결정에 관한 실험연구,"In this experimental study, it is concerned to develop a simple equation using jar-test results in order to predict the optimum dosage of coagulant, PAC(polyaluminum chloride), Considering the relationships with the reactions of coagulation and flocculation, the four independent variables (e.g. turbidity, temperature, pH and alkalinity) are selected out of many parameters and they are put into calculations to develop an equation by means of multi-regression method.
As the result, the dosing rate of PAC is proportional to turbidity, pH and alkalinity, but in inverse to temperature. And the developed equation is as follow,
D_c = 3.2·T^(0.37)·A^(0.04)·P^(0.5)/t^(0.1), (R²= 0.9443).
And also, comparing between the estimated value from the equation and the real dosing rate in the plant, Kwangam and Tdukdo, during 1988∼1991, it is represented an agreement having a relative error of 16.4%, 17.8%, respectively.",김홍석,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100255092
학교의 실내공기질 관리현황 및 개선방안 제언,"National concerns about air pollution are growing. The importance of indoor air quality is emerging because people live in an indoor environment more than 90% of the day. In particular, the indoor air quality of schools needs to be managed as teenagers are vulnerable to environmental pollution. The government has designated the School Health Act in order to manage indoor air quality in schools. Air purifiers have been operated to improve indoor air quality in the classroom since 2018. In this study, we performed on-site evaluations in some classrooms, and then we proposed a plan for improving the air quality in the classroom. In this study, PM10, PM2.5, and CO2 in classrooms in Chungnam were measured to analyze the effect of air cleaner supply. A portable aerosol spectrometer (PAS, model 1.109, Grimm) and CO2 meter (TES 1370, TES) were used as measuring instruments. Schools A and B exceeded the recommended standards, while school C met the standards. The ratio of PM10, PM2.5 in classrooms A and B was 0.58 and 0.5, respectively. Correlation analysis was performed between indoor and outdoor pollutants to analyze the effects of particulate pollutants present in each classroom. First, the measured concentration of fine particles was classified according to/on the basis of factors that affect/influence the internal environment of the classroom. Then, fine dust concentrations measured at the same time as AQMS were classified with regard to the external factors. The gradients for each classroom were 1.57, 1.63, and 1.54, although there were differences in concentration, but they were relatively similar. It is necessary to develop and disseminate customized air purifiers considering the activity of the occupants of classrooms. It is important to consider the areas in which s tudents breathe when installing air purifiers in the classroom. In addition, follow-up management of air purifiers is an essential element. For efficient operation and management of indoor air quality, it is necessary to develop and disseminate standard manuals for air purifiers. It is proposed that an environmental manager should be deployed in schools to manage environmental issues. Standardization of air purifiers, management guidelines for standard manuals, and field support for environmental sheriffs should be established on a legal basis.",노수진,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3007703
