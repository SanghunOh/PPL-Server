Considering the urban policies, population change and chronological incidents, this study divided 4 different stages of change as ‘Formation Period of policy migration area’, ‘Expansion Period according to needs and requirements’, ‘Stagnant Period following Act on Temporary Measures’ and ‘Decline Period with New Town Plan’. After exploring the policies, spatial structure and architectural changes of each period, following conclusions have been found. First, without detailed plan and infra structures, policy migration in Busan in the 1960s and 1970s produced another low quality residential area excluding urban poor in the downtown to the outskirts of the city with many problems in living, working and education. Second, simple planning of repetitive back-to-back small standard lot (50.98m2) without considering topography produced monotonous residential area without adequate street, park and public facility. Third, following urban expansion with industrial district nearby area and urban policies to consider the people in policy migration area had caused huge housing demand and legal/illegal extension, expansion and new construction of of housing. Fourth, the people in the policy migration area have been responding to the changing social/economic/policy environment with producing maximum building coverage ratio and fllor area ratio, creating various types of housing and functional variation of spaces utilizing small standard lot, merging lots or dividing lot.",하남구,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107778606
'音'의 建築,"Starting from a personal interest in music, this study was begun from a kind of searching process as to which way it has correlation on an extension line with the architecture and which way it can respond to mutual sphere.
In fact, the correlation between music and architecture can go back up to the past Greek age due to its structural and creative similarity. However, it is thought that the music and the architecture at this time has a little difference from the result of avant-garde thoughts, which are being performed in modern times. In other words, as for the music and the architecture at this time, its background had the value criterion with deeply religious inclination, and also it was understood as the result of the expression. Even as for the direct effect on music and architecture, there were many examples that sensitive elements of music with somewhat abstract and deep-intangible feature or the structural elements such as an artist's mental image, tone or a chord, are directly replaced as architecture, and it is thought that there were only attempts to structurally analyze music through principles of numerical value and proportion such as a golden ratio, which arose from the human body and nature, and to apply this to design.
However, as time goes on, a change in an era allowed numerous thoughts and isms to be appeared, with going in gear with a change in value system. There were radical artists who tried to experiment such changes, and the works. which show an interest in a concept called 'contingency,' came to appear in the whole of arts, passing over dada and surrealism even among them. In terms of music, many composers such as Stockhausen and Xenakis including John Cage experimented as to the value of contingency through their works, and it is a fact that its influence became a stimulus to the wholly artistic fields including music in modern times, as the result such as an effort for the challenge and experiment toward the new world and for the expansion of vision, aside from the excellency of a melody. These experiments assisted in seeking for the conversion into the new viewpoint toward value and order that the architecture has pursued on and on since history, and the cross-over works surpassing each of the artistic sphere, allow many architects to explore. This report aims to retrace a meaning from the past in terms of music and architecture on the basis of this position, to search for the correlation between music and architecture as another value, and to seek for possibilities that are revealed through its architectural process.
In case of mentioning the correlation between music and architecture, from the position of architecture, it can be found its linking pin with largely three viewpoints. Those include the structurally analysis method that substitutes the rules of the musical scale, a chord, and a musical composition for an architectural space, facade ratio, and a plane scheme, the numerical method that analyzes in accordance with the peculiar frequency being possessed by tone, sound and noise, and with properties of sound, and a method of metaphorically substituting an artist's sensitivity and inspiration being felt from music, for a space constitution and the feature of architecture, as the creative aspect that is influenced by an artist's capability and sensitivity as well as architecture. This project aims to focus on progressing the architectural process while having an interest in the numerical analysis, which is the second method among these three approaches. That is because it can be seen that sound and noise in any form, namely, various sound sources always exist in all the space and in a space of physical media where we are living, even though being invisible, and because of judging that it is possible to be formed by the objectively data scape based on this. And, as mentioned beforehand, it is included the intention of the person in question who tries to once again manifest experimental composers' spirit in the architecture, in terms of the basic value and possibilities for 'sound' in music.
Additionally in the above, what ""it can occur in any space"" and ""the relationship among diversely sound sources"" mean the happening of an event, and this enables the conceptual approach of Bricolage. That is to say, as 'the process of aiming to change into a new role,' which is being described in 'the wild thought' of Levi-Strauss, from the aspect as to the relationship between structure and an event and the relationship between material and a tool. this study can be seen to have symbolized 'sound' and it can be said to be the purpose of this study that visually recomposes by the Bricolage of sound sources, which are possible to occur around a site.
In conclusion, the noise, which is produced around a site, enables a role of 'conceptual material,' which will make it possible for the starting as the architectural shape, and a computer comes to be in charge of the function of 'a tool' which visualizes this. In this study, it comes to make 'the space of sound' and 'the space responding to sound' as the finally architectural form through the repetitive work of this, by having it as the motif of architectural design, through visualizing and spacing the target named invisible 'sound,' by searching for the spatial possibilities through this computer and by specifying through virtually modeling study. Accordingly, this study has a meaning in the process of visualizing as to 'sound' that locally occurs through a site like this, and in experimenting the possibilities that can be recognized by people as the positive element along with another perceptive response, through being induced and changed into the form of visual and spatial perception, other than only the negative aspect being possessed by noise, namely, the auditory target, which is being, recognized as pollution, as well as in applying this as the element of architectural design and in understanding as the specific context of a site.",김두용,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76526031

서울 행복주택 주변지역의 님비현상 분석,"Recently, the rise in the housing burden on young couples has led to a serious housing poverty among young people. The number of youngpeople who move into public rental housing is very small because the eligibility for public rental housing is determined based on income,the status of housing subscription, and the size of the household. With this background, the government launched a public rental housingprogram called Happy Housing Project, which gives young people the priority to move in first. However, the program is facing an obstacledue to the opposition of local residents. The purpose of this paper is to examine whether public rental housing can induce the NIMBYsyndrome through conducting a literature review, followed by an analysis of NIMBY syndrome around the currently supplied Happy Housedevelopment areas, and finally analyzing the household characteristics in order to identify which households were prone to the NIMBYsyndrome. To confirm the existence of the NIMBY syndrome, this paper comparatively analyzed the two groups using binary logit analysis.
The first group consists of households that are against the Happy House policy, and the second group consists of households that are awareof the Happy House development taking place in their neighborhoods, and are against the development. This study considered the householdsagainst the Happy House development in their neighborhoods to have NIMBY tendencies, and focused on comparing the households withNIMBY tendencies with those who do not. To confirm whether the residents around the Happy House neighborhoods have NIMBYtendencies, this paper compared the two groups and confirmed that about 4% of the households have NIMBY tendencies. This papersubsequently analyzed the households with NIMBY tendencies, and found them to have a higher number of children, reside in apartmentsand reside in owned homes. The volume of the 2018 Happy Housing (35,000 households) is three times higher than that of 2017.

It is to test the relationship between spatial location(such as average height，distance from large-city centers, and spatial location(island, seaside inland region etc.)) and accessability(such as road density, distance from highway toll-gate and distance from railway station，etc.) factors.
Findings indicate that there is an association between spatial location and accessability factors and spatial patterns of population density. Particularly，the most important variable of the spatial factors which influence the spatial patterns of population density is distance from large-city centers. And reciprocal numbers of distance from large -city centers, highway toll gates, and railway stations are positively correlated with logarithmic population density and squaring of reciprocal number of distance from large-city center, highway toll gate，and railway station are negatively correlated with logarithmic population density. Road density is positively correlated with logarithmic population density and average height is negatively correlated with logarithmic, population density.

Secondly, the paper tube architecture is divided into the permanent building and the temporary building. While permanent building was subject to complying with the cost-efficiency, workability and client's needs, the temporary building required cost-efficiency, workability, temporality and environment-friendly benefit, and some regionality-related conditions in addition. Thirdly, the paper tube was mostly used for wall, which had started with the column or wall in which the columns were simply arranged in a row at the early stage, to the structure or shell structure, gradually expanding its use, even to the structural material as the performance of the paper tube became recognized. The wooden material was commonly used as the joint at the early stage, which was gradually extended to the plastic, metal and die-cast aluminum joint after various tests in line with increasingly expanded use of the paper tube. Finally, in the wake of evaluation of Shigeru Ban's paper tube architecture, the process of applying the Shigeru Ban's paper tube to the architecture could be categorized into the introduction stage, application stage and stabilization stage, which enabled to define the characteristics of the Shigeru Ban's architecture in general.",최창렬(Choi Chang-Yeol),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107184539
국내병원의 유형별 손위생 수행실태 조사분석,"Purpose : The easiest and most cost-effective way to prevent medical-related infections is known as proper hand washing of health care workers. The experience of MERS in domestic medical institutions has increased the importance of hand hygiene for medical workers to prevent infections in hospitals. It is necessary to investigate the level of hand hygiene practice by type of medical institutions and the factors influencing the infection prevention. Methods : Domestic and overseas hand hygiene related business cases and literature data were collected and analyzed in order to investigate the hand hygiene status of medical institutions in Korea. Result : As a result of hand hygiene monitoring of all hospital-level medical institutions in 2016, the total number of observations was 24,328 and the hand hygiene performance rate was 75.9%. The hand hygiene performance rate of hospitals was 71.5% for general hospitals, 75% for general hospitals, and 81.3% for hospitals. Implications : In general hospitals and hospitals, the HR(Hand Rubbing) method is preferred as a way of performing hand hygiene, whereas the HW(Hand Washing) method is relatively high in the small hospitals. It is estimated that the HW system is preferred because of the cost burden at the hospital medical institution. Therefore, it is necessary to compensate the related expenses to improve the hand hygiene performance of the physicians who are engaged in the hospitals.",이용균,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106922454

텍스트 마이닝을 활용한 공간복지 관련 국내 연구 경향 분석,"This study delves into the evolving welfare paradigm, transitioning from selective support services to comprehensive space-based universalservices. To accomplish this, relevant research literature linking space and welfare was gathered and subjected to text mining analysis todiscern prevalent trends. The research landscape has witnessed a shift. While earlier studies predominantly concentrated on sociallydisadvantaged groups, a growing number of investigations no longer target specific demographics. This reflects an evolving socialconsciousness wherein universal welfare is progressively being integrated into scholarly discussions. As welfare beneficiaries extend toencompass the wider local populace, there arises a need for an in depth exploration of demand-oriented spatial welfare. This entailsidentifying the genuine welfare requirements of local residents and providing fitting spatial solutions. Although the range of studied spaceshas expanded to encompass diverse areas like residential and living infrastructure facilities, the majority of research still centers aroundconventional social welfare facilities. This is somewhat insufficient to mirror the swiftly changing societal expectations. In this context of thenew normal era, it is imperative to consolidate research across previously segmented facilities, considering the anticipated surge inmultifaceted welfare service demands. Lastly, it was observed that distinct topics within the Built Environment realm, such as CPTED,universal design, and sustainable design, have intertwined with welfare discussions. Employing text mining analysis, this study endeavors touncover research trends more objectively and quantitatively. This study’s outcomes hold academic significance by enhancing comprehension ofthe concept of space-based welfare.

이토 도요(Toyo Ito)의 공공건축물에 나타나는 건축적 특징에 관한 연구,"This study analyzes the spatial attributes of Toyo Ito’s public institutions, focusing on the concept of boundary ambiguity. Toyo Ito, arenowned Japanese architect, and recipient of the 2013 Pritzker Prize, argues that public institutions should not merely serve as functionalspaces, but rather as environments where citizens can freely gather, relax, and forge new communities. He emphasizes the freedom of usermovement and the potential for communication, prioritizing these over strict functionality and efficiency. Toyo Ito consistently advocates for asense of freedom and ambiguous order, inspired by the natural world, to grant autonomy to spaces and enhance communication. Hisarchitectural concepts encompass Blurring Architecture, Emerging Grid, and the merging of internal and external boundaries. Through theseconcepts, it becomes evident that Toyo Ito’s spatial compositions within public institutions evolve through shifts in grids and structuralelements. Furthermore, boundary elements undergo various forms of deconstruction that align with natural characteristics, revealing theambiguity of physical and cognitive boundaries. These ambiguous boundaries create overlaps in programming and foster new interactionsthrough interferences. Instead of conventional public spaces, Toyo Ito’s architecture features fluid, blurry, and ambiguous boundaries, designedto encourage interaction. This can be seen as a pioneering endeavor in response to the demands of a new era.",박예지,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108618055
대학로 젠트리피케이션의 전개와 특성,"The Daehakro was designated as a cultural district in 2004 to protect and foster small theaters. However, it is evaluated that gentrification is accelerating due to rising land prices and rents. This study analyzed the architectural behavior, the opening and closing business of the theater, and the performing arts fund to analyzed the gentrification status of Daehakro. A focus group interview was also conducted to compensate for phenomena not expressed quantitatively. As a result, after the designation of the cultural district, the Daehakro has increased the absolute number of theaters. However, the building activities also concentrated, and the commercialization of the region proceeded at the same time. This led to a rise in the rents of the theaters, resulting in closing the theaters or locating to new areas near Daehakro. Responding to the gentrification phenomena of Daehakro requires continuous monitoring of regional changes, and it is worth considering the public assets of private theaters that are worth preserving. In addition, the public needs to provide a more stable creative environment by exploring new areas, out of Daehakro.",김미영,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108731180

The conclusion is as following: First, there were prior studies and plans for follow-up during the Olympic preparation process, but the scope of setting up the Olympic legacy was wide, including various categories such as culture and environment, and among them, measures for sports facilities only suggested a comprehensive direction. Second, there are very large differences in the establishment and application of post-utilization plans for each athletic facility. Speed skating stadiums, which do not have a clear plan for post-use, are temporarily operated for rental purposes, but Ice Arena and others are also multi-purpose sports facilities and athletes-only stadiums, widening the gap in the utilization of legacy. Third, the plans of local governments were limited to the level of planning to continue the cause of facility maintenance.

도시지역의 녹지공간이 공동주택가격에 미치는 영향:서울시 근린공원을 중심으로,"Many countries around the world have introduced housing policies, such as tax subsidies and loan assistance, to increase homeownership. In order to discuss the social impact of homeowner-favored housing policies, the relationship between housing tenure status and social benefits must be empirically investigated. As an exploratory study, this paper aims to analyze the motivational effects of homeownership on participation in social activities including voluntary works, issuing civil complaints, participation in policy projects, and making policy proposals. Using the Seoul Survey of 2017, this paper empirically verifies that homeownership is significantly statistically associated with more active civic engagement. The standardized logistic regression results also show that homeowners are more likely to participate in community planning efforts. These findings imply that a policy approach for expanding homeownership would not only enhance personal life stability but would also reinforce social benefits that stem from civic engagement. In consideration of the fact that city planning methods that include participation of local residents have become more important these days, this paper suggests that a bottom-up planning approach can be effectively sustained in conjunction with housing policies promoting homeownership.",김태범,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19603522

건축기획업무 범위설정 및 제도화 방안에 관한 연구,"Architectural planning is used as a service to set the primary direction of a project during the pre-design stage. It is usually the main task during the institutionalization process of a construction project. Compared to other architectural design services, architectural planning regulatory laws are significantly lacking, most of the current laws are only applicable to large-scale construction work or public projects. This study breaks down architectural planning by dividing it into pre-project and pre-design while specifying what architectural planning service entails. The intention behind this research is to propose an institutional improvement to promote architectural planning services. Case studies from the United States and Germany were analyzed as it pertains to their domestic legal system and their public projects involving architectural planning. Research literature and interviews with experts also helped supplement the classification process of architectural planning into the following seven categories: orientations & objectives, current status & analysis, similar case studies, analysis and reviews on scale & scope of projects, analysis of economic feasibility surveys & strategic initiatives, project planning & management and administrative work.

사례연구를 통한 메타버스 건축디자인에 대한 고찰,"The Metaverse is a new digital world where the users not only play there, but also live their lives in it. The use of the Metaverse has been extended to various fields with the development and integration of technology; it is growing rapidly with an ever-increasing number of users and platforms. The growing interest and use of the Metaverse has increased the attention given to the architectural design of Metaverse platforms. Although the Metaverse world has distinct characteristics compared to the real world such as no gravity and no climate effects, architectural design in popular Metaverse platforms tends to imitate the architectural designs of the real world. However, given the characteristics of the Metaverse, architectural design in the Metaverse can be unique and different from architectural design in the real world. Moreover, because the goal of the Metaverse is to partially relocate people’s real world lives to the Metaverse world, it is significant to give people a proper space experience through optimal design like how real architectural space does. To do so, architectural design in the Metaverse needs to support the diverse daily activities of users, further helping users enjoy Metaverse platforms that also promote interaction between users. This study used a case study and analyzed five representative Metaverse platforms in games, social experiences, collaborations, simulations and designs, and creator economy categories.

The ultimate goal of these efforts to improve the walking environment is to increase the quantity and qualityof walking in the city through the simultaneous installation of a public transport system and a pedestrian network. To encourage pedestrianwalking, the establishment of a network of external spaces linked with an open space was set as a guideline during the planning stage; thisurban environment maintenance zone was planned and developed in each zone. This study aims to analyze data focusing on the connectivityof open spaces in an urban environment maintenance area that prioritizes activating a pedestrian network. Open space is an auxiliary basethat enhances interaction between major bases; it is also a space where social activities occur, an everyday place located in the city centerand serves as a key factor in strengthening continuous and well-connected walking. To analyze open space connectivity, three networkconcepts were used: two-dimension, three-dimension and socio-Spatial. The results showed that two-dimension connectivity was high, whereasthree-dimension network and Socio-Spatial network connectivity was low. This was due to a Two-dimension formal plan being appliedwithout considering the purpose of the public space, which should be established based on contact amongst members of society. Based onour analytical findings, important factors for consideration was suggested when creating an external space for a pedestrian network in anurban environment improvement project to be carried out in the future.",석수진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108731173
