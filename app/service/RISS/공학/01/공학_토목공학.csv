However, an Electric vehicle has not been popular due to the constraints such as its price or technical limitations. In order to analyze the effect of purchasing electric vehicles, this study conducted a binary logistic regression model that demonstrates the relation between purchasing and influencing variables. Variables which have high correlation were excluded from the model through the correlation analysis to prevent multicollinearity. Socio-economic variables such as the number of owned vehicles, sex, ages are not significant. On the other hand, Variables related to prices, charging and policy are found to have a significant to effect on the purchase of electric vehicles. In accordance with the model estimated result, it seems to be necessary to improve the charging incentives, or to provide electric car information and to expand opportunities for experience electric vehicles. The result is also expected to be helpful for spreading electric vehicles and formulating policies.",김숙희,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103217168
시계열 군집분석과 로지스틱 회귀분석을 이용한 골목상권 성장요인 연구,"Recently, growing social interest in alley markets, which have shown rapid growth like Gyeonglidan-gil street in Seoul, has led to the need for an analysis of growth factors. This paper aims at exploring growing alley markets through time-series clustering using DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) and examining the growth factors through logistic regression. According to cluster analysis, the number of growing markets of the Northeast, the Southwest, and the Southeast were much more than the Northwest but the proportion in region of the Northwest, the Northeast, and the Southwest were much more than the Southeast. Logistic regression results show that people in 20s and 30s have a lower impact on sales than those in 50s, but have a greater impact on growth of alley market. Alley markets located in high-income areas often reached their growth limits, indicating a tendency to stagnate or decline. The proximity of a subway station effected positive on sales but negative on growth. This research is an advanced study in that the causes of sales growth of alley markets is examined, which has not been examined in the preceding study.",강현모,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100543442
Sequence to Sequence based LSTM (LSTM-s2s)모형을 이용한 댐유입량 예측에 대한 연구,"Forecasting dam inflow based on high reliability is required for efficient dam operation. In this study, deep learning technique, which is one of the data-driven methods and has been used in many fields of research, was manipulated to predict the dam inflow. The Long Short-Term Memory deep learning with Sequence-to-Sequence model (LSTM-s2s), which provides high performance in predicting time-series data, was applied for forecasting inflow of Soyang River dam. Various statistical metrics or evaluation indicators, including correlation coefficient (CC), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), percent bias (PBIAS), and error in peak value (PE), were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the model. The result of this study presented that the LSTM-s2s model showed high accuracy in the prediction of dam inflow and also provided good performance for runoff event based runoff prediction. It was found that the deep learning based approach could be used for efficient dam operation for water resource management during wet and dry seasons.",한희찬,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108389662
졸겔공법을 이용한 복합상변화물질의 열성능 평가,"In this study, a composite phase change material (CPCM) produced using the SOL-GEL technique was developed as a thermal energy storage medium for low-temperature applications. Tetradecane and activated carbon (AC) were used as the core and supporting materials, respectively. The tetradecane phase change material (PCM) was impregnated into the porous structure of AC using the vacuum impregnation method, and a thin layer of silica gel was coated on the prepared composite using the SOL-GEL process, where tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) was used as the silica source. The thermal performance of the CPCM was analysed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). DSC results showed that the pure tetradecane PCM had melting and freezing temperatures of 6.4 ℃ and 1.3℃ and corresponding enthalpies 226 J/g and 223.8 J/g, respectively. The CPCM exhibited enthalpy of 32.98 J/g and 27.7 J/g during the melting and freezing processes at 7.1℃ and 2.4℃, respectively. TGA test results revealed that the AC is thermally stable up to 500℃, which is much higher than the decomposition temperature of the pure tetradecane, which is around 120℃.
Moreover, in the case of AC-PCM and CPCM thermal degradation started at 80℃ and 100℃, respectively. The chemical stability of the CPCM was studied using Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and the results confirmed that the developed composite is chemically stable. Finally, the surface morphology of the AC and CPCM was analysed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which confirmed the presence of a thin layer of silica gel on the AC surface after the SOL-GEL process.",김성한,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106921515
리튬 이차전지 제조 공정으로부터 발생한 리튬 폐액의 재활용을 위한 전기 투석 수처리 장치의 리튬 농축 효율에 관한 연구,"The rapid market growth in recent years for eco-friendly electric vehicles and more generally, energy storage technologies, has led to an increase in demand for lithium which is a major raw material for lithium secondary batteries. The technology for producing lithium ions from lithium carbonate in seawater 25 L has been developed, but there are about 60 kinds of various ionic components, which is a difficult process, and only about 4 mg of lithium is recovered. In order to meet the demand of lithium, research is being actively conducted to recycle lithium secondary batteries that contain lithium and can be recycled as a circulating resource, but there is little research on recycling of waste liquid generated during the manufacturing process of lithium secondary batteries. Wastewater of lithium is thought to be able to efficiently concentrate lithium metal during recycling using an environmentally friendly electrodialysis water treatment process. In this study, lithium was concentrated using the electrodialysis of wastewater generated during the production of lithium-ion batteries. The efficiency of the electrodialysis varied according to the applied voltage and the volume ratio of the solution. However, due to the disadvantages of employing limited current densities, optimum conditions for the process needed to be selected. Therefore, the concentration efficiency of lithium was confirmed according to the process conditions, and optimum process conditions were derived. Lithium concentrated at the optimum conditions secured a concentration increase of about 128% compared to the initial concentration of wastewater.",한덕현 ( Deokhyun Han ),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106520005

홍수터 식생에 의한 하도의 지형변화와 적응과정 실험적 분석,"This study investigates the evolution processes of alternate bars in the channel with bank stability by vegetation by laboratory experiment. Laboratory experiments are conducted to elucidate the behavior of alternate bars by the influence of riparian vegetation on the rivers with erodible banks. To control bank stability of the channel, the actual vegetation, alfalfa, is grown by adjusting the density of alfalfa on the flood plain. As the vegetation density increases in the flood plain, the bank erosion rates and the channel widening rates decrease and the bank stability increases. The alternate bars migrate slow downstream over time. Moreover, the bars in a channel with strong banks migrate rapidly, which is related with the aspect ratio, that is, width to depth ratio. The bar wavelength decrease with vegetation density. Our laboratory experiments show that the behavior of bars differ according to bank strength.",장창래,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102378338
하수처리수의 3차처리를 위한 고도산화법(AOP)의 적용성에 관한 연구,"Ozone has been applied in combination with various processes for the tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater. However, in Korea, the ozone process is mainly employed for the reuse of tertiary treated wastewater, and an enhanced advanced oxidation process (AOP) is needed to realize the large-scale reuse of treated wastewater. In this study, various AOPs employing ozone (only ozone process, O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>+UV, O<sub>3</sub>+GAC) were used to analyze the TOC, CODcr, and color treatment efficiencies of municipal wastewater and evaluate its applicability of wastewater reuse. The O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process showed the highest TOC removal efficiency of 62.0%, while the O<sub>3</sub>+GAC and only ozone processes exhibited the TOC removal efficiencies of 58.9% and 59.3%, respectively. The TOC removal pattern of the O<sub>3</sub>+UV process was similar to that of the O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. The TOC removal efficiency of the O<sub>3</sub>+UV process, 61.0%, was slightly lower than that of the O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> process. The CODcr removal efficiencies of the O<sub>3</sub>+UV and O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> processes were 75.8% and 77.0%, respectively. However, the TOC and CODcr removal efficiencies were different within the error range, so there was no significant difference in the processing efficiencies of the methods investigated. The color removal efficiencies of the O<sub>3</sub>+UV (57.8%) and O<sub>3</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (57.4%) processes were 57.8%, 57.4%. respectively and it showed similar pattern.",정은호 ( Eunho Chung ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108406982

입상활성탄흡착과 막여과공정을 이용한 고도정수처리특성,"This study was performed to investigate the characteristics of granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption and membrane filtration (MF) processes for an advanced water treatment. Influent concentration were on average UV254 0.237cm-1, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 9.3mg/L, dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) 0.558mg/L and dissolved total phosphorus (DTP) 0.014mg/L, respectively. As a result, MF process compared to GAC adsorption process was slightly effective in removing UV254 and DOC, whereas in removing DTN and DTP, GAC adsorption process was much more effective than that of MF process. Coulped GAC adsorption with MF process achieved good efficiencies more than 50% in removing dissolved organic and nutrients. These results indicate that the introduction of GAC adsorption process prior to membrane filtration process is necessary for an cost-effective advanced water treatment due to efficient reduction of substrate and transmembrane pressure (TMP).",김지연 ( Jiyeon Kim ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105946960
Jar - Test 를 이용한 응집제 주입율 결정에 관한 실험연구,"In this experimental study, it is concerned to develop a simple equation using jar-test results in order to predict the optimum dosage of coagulant, PAC(polyaluminum chloride), Considering the relationships with the reactions of coagulation and flocculation, the four independent variables (e.g. turbidity, temperature, pH and alkalinity) are selected out of many parameters and they are put into calculations to develop an equation by means of multi-regression method.

2017 포항지진에 의한 필로티형 내력벽건물의 구조손상 분석,"In 2017 Pohang Earthquake, a number of residential buildings with pilotis at their first level were severely damaged. In this study, the results of an analytical investigation on the seismic performance and structural damage of two bearing wall buildings with pilotis are presented. The vibration mode and lateral force-resisting mechanism of the buildings with vertical and plan irregularity were investigated through elastic analysis. Then, based on the investigations, methods of nonlinear modeling for walls and columns at the piloti level were proposed. By performing nonlinear static and dynamic analyses, structural damages of the walls and columns at the piloti level under 2017 Pohang Earthquake were predicted. The results show that the area and arrangement of walls in the piloti level significantly affected the seismic safety of the buildings. Initially, the lateral resistance of the piloti story was dominated mainly by the walls resisting in-plane shear. After shear cracking and yielding of the walls, the columns showing double-curvature flexural behavior contributed significantly to the residual strength and ductility.",엄태성,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103217172
고속푸리에변환을 이용한 시공간 체적 표면유속 산정 기법 개발,"The surface image velocimetry was developed to measure river flow velocity safely and effectively in flood season. There are a couple of methods in the surface image velocimetry. Among them the spatio-temporal image velocimetry is in the spotlight, since it can estimate mean velocity for a period of time. For the spatio-temporal image velocimetry analyzes a series of images all at once, it can reduce analyzing time so much. It, however, has a little drawback to find out the main flow direction. If the direction of spatio-temporal image does not coincide to the main flow direction, it may cause singnificant error in velocity. The present study aims to propose a new method to find out the main flow direction by using a fast Fourier transform(FFT) to a spatio-temporal (image) volume, which were constructed by accumulating the river surface images along the time direction. The method consists of two steps; the first step for finding main flow direction in space image and the second step for calculating the velocity magnitude in main flow direction in spatio-temporal image. In the first step a time-accumulated image was made from the spatio-temporal volume along the time direction. We analyzed this time-accumulated image by using FFT and figured out the main flow direction from the transformed image. Then a spatio-temporal image in main flow direction was extracted from the spatio-temporal volume. Once again, the spatio-temporal image was analyzed by FFT and velocity magnitudes were calculated from the transformed image. The proposed method was applied to a series of artificial images for error analysis. It was shown that the proposed method could analyze two-dimensional flow field with fairly good accuracy.",류권규,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107176289
