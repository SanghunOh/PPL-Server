This study proposes a methodology for analyzing user satisfaction of delivery apps based on app market review data. The subject of this study is the review data of BaeMin and Coupang Eats, which are the most actively used delivery apps in Korea. First, we analyze the main factors in the process of using the delivery app service, and analyze the review data by dividing them into app usability factors, delivery-related factors, product-related factors, and marketing-related factors. Then, after data collection and preprocessing, an undefined dictionary is created to refine the data. Based on the refined data, we perform logistic regression analysis to identify keywords that influence positive or negative reviews for each factor. After that, based on the analysis results and derived content, we analyze and evaluate the usability of the delivery app for four factors. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of the two delivery apps to find their strengths and weaknesses which in turn lead to differences and improvements.

It utilized the data of 3,454 adolescents (1,758 males and 1,696 females), aged between 13 and 19 from a smartphone overdependence survey of the National Information Society Agency. As a result of the hierarchical multiple regression analysis, age and household income had a negative effect on smartphone overdependence. Weekly smartphone usage time positively affected the serious consequences (sub-factor of smartphone overdependence). Among the different types of smartphone usage, information seeking, SNS, gaming, and the excessive expectation for smartphones had positive impact on smartphone overdependence. Smartphone usage for leisure seeking did not affect smartphone overdependence, but it negatively influenced serious consequences. Messenger use did not affect smartphone overdependence, but the use had a positive effect on salience, and a negative effect on serious consequences. The results of this study suggest that it is necessary to identify the types of smartphone use as well as the usage time to understand the smartphone dependence of adolescents.

러시아-우크라이나 전쟁에서 파악된 SNS 추천알고리즘의 필터버블 강화현상 분석,"This study is a study on the filter bubble reinforcement phenomenon of SNS recommendation algorithm such as YouTube, which is a characteristic of the Russian-Ukraine war (2022), and the victory or defeat factors of the hybrid war. This war is identified as a hybrid war, and the use of New Media based on the SNS recommendation algorithm is emerging as a factor that determines the outcome of the war beyond political leverage. For this reason, the filter bubble phenomenon goes beyond the dictionary meaning of confirmation bias that limits information exposed to viewers. A YouTube video of Ukrainian President Zelensky encouraging protests in Kyiv garnered 7.02 million views, but Putin's speech only 800,000, which is a evidence that his speech was not exposed to the recommendation algorithm. The war of these SNS recommendation algorithms tends to develop into an algorithm war between the US (YouTube, Twitter, Facebook) and China (TikTok) big tech companies. Influenced by US companies, Ukraine is now able to receive international support, and in Russia, under the influence of Chinese companies, Putin's approval rating is over 80%, resulting in conflicting results.
