This causes not only the production of altered content that synthesizes voice, but also the spread of cybercrime by misusing the content. A representative example of a similar crime is voice phishing, and there are appearing voice phishing crimes that misuse deep voice abroad as well as in Korea, so a service that can reduce damage should be developed. The victims are not only celebrities, public institutions, financial companies, etc., but also acquaintances or family members. In this study, we are going to propose a service (program) to prevent voice phishing damage that may occur in the course of telephony misusing deep voice technology. This service intend to develop this service for the purpose of distinguishing the actual speaker from the deep voice through the processes of deep learning, voice synthesis, speaker recognition, speaker identification, and speaker verification.

It is important to identify the presence of mental diseases in the early stages, and to treat them so that the symptoms do not get worse, such as physical diseases. However, on the contrary the perception of mental illness in Korea is still somewhat negative. Therefore, it is important to establish a system that allows people to diagnose and treat initial symptoms of mental illness with electronic devices anytime, anywhere, even if they do not visit any facility. Therefore, in this study, the current criteria for diagnosis of depression and trends in chatbots related to depression were analyzed in relation to mental illness, especially depression.

국내 망중립성 규제에 따른 시장의 영향연구,"This study empirically analyzed the effect of network neutrality regulation on the investment of domestic Internet Service Providers (ISP) and the number of broadband Internet subscribers. Prior studies on net neutrality were mainly approached by economics, and the results were mixed with pros and cons. This study empirically analyzed the impact of net neutrality regulation on the domestic market, and comprehensively confirmed the theoretical approach and empirical results. It was empirically analyzed whether there has been change in ISP investment and number of subscribers after regulation began in 2011. We employed FEM and System GMM in empirical analysis and confirmed that ISP investment decreased after the net neutrality regulation, and thus the number of broadband Internet subscribers also decreased. This study is differenciated from others in that it presented empirical results for the contradictory pros and cons of theoretical approaches in the absence of empirical studies on net neutrality regulation.
