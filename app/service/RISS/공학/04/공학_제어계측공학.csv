적외선 센서와 전방 영상 정보를 이용한 실내 자율주행 무인 비행체의 장애물 회피 방법,"This paper presents an obstacle avoidance algorithm for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) driving in indoor environments. The proposed algorithm utilizes an IR sensor and a front camera to detect and estimate an obstacle. The algorithm first estimates a distance between a UAV and an obstacle using an IR sensor. If an obstacle is located within a certain distance, the contour of the obstacle is extracted by the marker-controlled Watershed algorithm. Thereafter, a UAV recognizes the location of the obstacle and determines an adequate route. The proposed algorithm was verified by several examples, including colored-papers and pedestrians. Experimental results show that an obstacle is recognized well and the UAV can avoid the obstacle efficiently.",이혁진(Hyuk-Jin Lee),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103375226
국외 BIPV 설치 사례 분석 및 비교,"We depending on the imported energy about 97% are studying on how to reduce energy consumption, especially from buildings that is occupied more than 25% of total energy consumption rate. So, many renewable energies have been diffused and Photovoltaic(PV) system has been being growing 68% per year. In PV systems, BIPV(Building Integrated Photovoltaic)systems are attracted as new envelope materials that can produce electricity power coincidentally. Therefore, this study aims to analysis overseas BIPV cases. it is predicted to develop various BIPV systems on power and building envelop materials by investing close relations among materials, electricity, and architectures. And if our governments make new laws on increasing PV systems and taxes for buildings, our country can be the main market in the PV systems.",권오은(Oh-Eun Kwon),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82417746
휴머노이드 로봇플랫폼 HUBO2+의 기술 개선 추이,"This paper covers improvement of the humanoid robot platform HUBO2, known as the HUBO2+. As a necessity of the growth of the humanoid platform, a robust, reliable and user friendly platform is needed. From this standpoint, HUBO2+ is the most improved humanoid robot platform in the HUBO series. The mechanical design has been changed to increase the movable range and to stop joint compulsion. Additionally, all of the electrical parts are re-designed to be un-breakable in an unexpected situation. A smart power controller with robot status check panel is attached on the back. Additionally, a diagnosis tool, the HUBO-i, has been developed. Moreover, each joint motor controller of HUBO2+ has a Protection Function and a PODO system is provided for handling the robot easily.",임정수(Jeongsoo Lim),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99919304
다중 카메라 시스템을 위한 전방위 Visual-LiDAR SLAM,"Due to the limited field of view of the pinhole camera, there is a lack of stability and accuracy in camera pose estimation applications such as visual SLAM. Nowadays, multiple-camera setups and large field of cameras are used to solve such issues. However, a multiple-camera system increases the computation complexity of the algorithm. Therefore, in multiple camera-assisted visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) the multi-view tracking algorithm is proposed that can be used to balance the budget of the features in tracking and local mapping. The proposed algorithm is based on PanoSLAM architecture with a panoramic camera model. To avoid the scale issue 3D LiDAR is fused with omnidirectional camera setup. The depth is directly estimated from 3D LiDAR and the remaining features are triangulated from pose information. To validate the method, we collected a dataset from the outdoor environment and performed extensive experiments. The accuracy was measured by the absolute trajectory error which shows comparable robustness in various environments.",JAVED ZEESHAN,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108248917
센서 융합을 이용한 자율 이동 로봇(AMR)의 도킹제어 알고리즘,"We developed a methodology to achieve position estimation, path planning and control for autonomous docking systems of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). For autonomous docking, the relative position between the AMR and the docking station must be accurately estimated. The relative position determined using a camera and lidar sensors is inaccurate, and the position update rate is insufficient. To solve this problem, we propose a Kalman filter that uses an inertial measurement unit and information from a wheel encoder sensor in combination. The position estimated by the Kalman filter has a smaller root mean square error and variance than those obtained from the camera and lidar sensors, and the position is updated every 25 ms. The control system for path planning and docking was implemented in the Robot Operating System, and the algorithm was verified through Gazebo simulation. Finally, the developed algorithm was verified in real environments. The experimental results yielded a position error of less than 1 cm and an angle error of less than 1°.",석효빈,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108736964
실시간 시스템인 승강기 제어기 프로그램 개발,"This paper discusses a real time multi-tasking system model and a development environment for an elevator control system. Recently, as the elevator systems become large-scaled and operate with high speed, there are lots of software tasks to be processed with time constraints. Thus, the control systems are designed with distributed control structure and characteristics of typical real time systems. For structural design of such real time system, we introduce a multi-tasking model based on a real time operating system model and an software development environment based on virtual prototyping which simulates real system operation in the cross development environment. The developed system model and the development environment are successfully applied to development of a new elevator system with distributed control structure and its system reliability can be verified through numerous field tests.",최병욱,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75014828
LM 최적화 알고리즘을 이용한 유리함수 모델의 데이터 피팅,"This paper considers a data fitting problem for rational function models using the LM (Levenberg-Marquardt) optimization method. Rational function models have various merits on representing a wide range of shapes and modeling complicated structures by polynomials of low degrees in both the numerator and denominator. However, rational functions are nonlinear in the parameter vector, thereby requiring nonlinear optimization methods to solve the fitting problem. In this paper, we propose a data fitting method for rational function models based on the LM algorithm which is renowned as an effective nonlinear optimization technique. Simulations show that the fitting results are robust against the measurement noises and uncertainties. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further demonstrated by the real application to a 3D depth camera calibration problem.",박재한(Jae-Han Park),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60294767
