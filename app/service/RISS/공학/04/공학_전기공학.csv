Electric shock hazards are exposed and electric shocks such as death or serious injury are occurring in electric railway vehicles, railway high-voltage distribution lines, and catenary system. In order to analyze the types of electric shock accidents on railway by systematic approach method, we modeled ‘unsafe behavior classification’ method using swiss cheese model.

반도체 탄소 중립을 위한 친환경 가스 기반 식각 공정 연구,"Currently, semiconductor manufacturing industry heavily relies on a wide range of high global warming potential (GWP) gases, particularly during etching and cleaning processes, and their use and relevant carbon emissions are subject to global rules and regulations for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. To replace high GWP gases in near future, dry etching using alternative low GWP gases is thus being under intense investigations. In this review, we report a current status and recent progress of the relevant research activities on dry etching processes using a low GWP gas. First, we review the concept of GWP itself and then introduce the difference between high and low GWP gases. Although most of the studies have concentrated on potentially replaceable additive gases such as C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, an ultimate solution with a lower GWP for main etching gases including CF<sub>4</sub> should be developed; therefore, we provide our own perspective in this regard. Finally, we summarize the advanced dry etch process research with low GWP gases and list up several issues to be considered in future research.",주정아 ( Jeonga Ju ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108511138

FinFET 및 GAAFET의 게이트 접촉면적에 의한 열저항 특성과 Fin-Layout 구조 최적화,"The performance of devices has been improved with fine processes from planar to three-dimensional transistors (e.g., FinFET, NWFET, and MBCFET). There are some problems such as a short channel effect or a self-heating effect occur due to the reduction of the gate-channel length by miniaturization. To solve these problems, we compare and analyze the electrical and thermal characteristics of FinFET and GAAFET devices that are currently used and expected to be further developed in the future. In addition, the optimal structure according to the Fin shape was investigated. GAAFET is a suitable device for use in a smaller scale process than the currently used, because it shows superior electrical and thermal resistance characteristics compared to FinFET. Since there are pros and cons in process difficulty and device characteristics depending on the channel formation structure of GAAFET, we expect a mass-production of fine processes over 5 nm through structural optimization is feasible.",조재웅,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107826951
리튬 2차전지용 $LiCoO_2$양극의 제조 및 특성,"In this study, new preparation method of LiCoO$_{2}$ was applied to develop cathode active material for Li rechargeable cell, and followed by X-ray diffraction analysis, electrochemical properties and initial charge/discharge characteristics as function of current density. HC8A72- and CC9A24-LiCoO$_{2}$ were prepared by heating treatment of the mixture of LiOH H$_{2}$O/CoCO$_{3}$(1:1 mole ratio) and the mixture of Li$_{2}$CO$_{3}$/CoCO$_{3}$(1:2 mole ratio) at 850 and 900.deg. C, respectively. Two prepared LiCoO$_{2}$s were identified as same structure by X-ray diffraction analysis. a and c lattice constant were 2.816.angs. and 14.046.angs., respectively. The electrochemical potential of CFM-LiCoO$_{2}$(Cyprus Foote Mineral Co.'s product), HC8A72-LiCoO$_{2}$ and CC9A24 LiCoO$_{2}$ electrode were approximately between 3.32V and 3.42V vs. Li/Li reference electrode. Stable cycling behavior was obtained during the cyclic voltammetry of LiCoO$_{2}$ electrode. According as scan rate increases, cathodic capacity decreases, but redox coulombic efficiency was about 100% at potential range between 3.6V and 4.2V vs. Li/Li reference electrode. Cathodic capacity of HC8A72-LiCoO$_{2}$ was 32% higher than that of CFM-LiCoO$_{2}$ and that of CC9A24-LiCoO$_{2}$ was 47% lower than that of CFM-LiCoO$_{2}$ at 130th cycle in the condition of lmV/sec scan rate.

Specific discharge capacities of CFM and HC8A72-LiCoO$_{2}$ cathode active materials were about 93mAh/g correspondent to 34% of theretical value, 110mAh/g correspondent to 40% of theretical value, respectively. In the view of reversibility, HC8A72-LiCoO$_{2}$ was also more excellent than CFM- and CC9A24-LiCoO$_{2}$.",문성인,1994,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100572018

일정 전기자극하의 근력 상승,The purpose of this work is to investigate the fundamental properties of the gradual muscle force potentiation. We investigated the dependence of force potentiation on both the pulse-amplitude and the pulse-duration with different ramp-up time. The experimental results showed that the force increment ratio (FIR) during constant electrical stimulation decreased with pulse-amplitude and also with pulse-duration. The FIR was greater with short ramp-up time in both the pulse-amplitude and pulse-width modulation. The feasible mechanism might be that the myosin light chain phosphorylation induces the force potentiation and it occurs only in the fast type muscle fibers which are recruited first. These observations indicate that muscle potentiation must be understood well for the accurate control of muscle force.,金智源(Ji-Won Kim),2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76541611

However, fire accidents in ESS have been continuously occurred, which have greatly affected the ESS market. Accordingly, the Korean government has estimated the causes of the fire accidents to ensure the safety of the ESS, and short circuits and grounded faults are being evaluated as one of the important electrical hazards causing fire accidents.
Therefore, this paper classifies major fault cases such as the short circuits in DC line, battery rack, PCS arm, and grounded fault in AC line based on the fire accident examples in ESS, and presents the safety evaluation method using the RPN(risk priority number) algorithm, which consists of severity, occurrence and detection degrees. Where, the severity degree is comprehensively evaluated by considering the impact of fault cases and the magnitude of the fault current, while the occurrence degree is determined by the exposure condition of fault cases, and the detection degree is estimated with the function and number of installed protection devices. Moreover, this paper performs the modeling of the fault cases in ESS using PSCAD/EMTDC S/W, and presents the fault characteristics depending on the simulation conditions.
