FinFET 및 GAAFET의 게이트 접촉면적에 의한 열저항 특성과 Fin-Layout 구조 최적화,"The performance of devices has been improved with fine processes from planar to three-dimensional transistors (e.g., FinFET, NWFET, and MBCFET). There are some problems such as a short channel effect or a self-heating effect occur due to the reduction of the gate-channel length by miniaturization. To solve these problems, we compare and analyze the electrical and thermal characteristics of FinFET and GAAFET devices that are currently used and expected to be further developed in the future. In addition, the optimal structure according to the Fin shape was investigated. GAAFET is a suitable device for use in a smaller scale process than the currently used, because it shows superior electrical and thermal resistance characteristics compared to FinFET. Since there are pros and cons in process difficulty and device characteristics depending on the channel formation structure of GAAFET, we expect a mass-production of fine processes over 5 nm through structural optimization is feasible.",조재웅,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107826951

기계학습을 활용한 모바일 반도체 제조 공정에서 동작 전압 예측,"Semiconductor engineers have long sought to enhance the energy efficiency of mobile semiconductors by reducing their voltage. During the final stages of the semiconductor manufacturing process, the screening and evaluation of voltage is crucial. However, determining the optimal test start voltage presents a significant challenge as it can increase testing time. In the semiconductor manufacturing process, a wealth of test element group information is collected. If this information can be controlled to predict the test voltage, it could lead to a reduction in testing time and increase the probability of identifying the optimal voltage. To achieve this, this paper is exploring machine learning techniques, such as linear regression and ensemble models, that can leverage large amounts of information for voltage prediction. The outcomes of these machine learning methods not only demonstrate high consistency but can also be used for feature engineering to enhance accuracy in future processes.",김광수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108545093

To replace high GWP gases in near future, dry etching using alternative low GWP gases is thus being under intense investigations. In this review, we report a current status and recent progress of the relevant research activities on dry etching processes using a low GWP gas.

전기영동 디스플레이에서 전자 잉크의 전류 특성 및 평가,"An investigation was conducted to determine whether the ratio of the fluid to the charged particles affects the panel reflexibility rate and the drifting current flowing in the panel, in electrophoretic-based electronic paper. In this regard, three panels were produced in this study with the ratio of the charged particles to the fluid set as 1:5, 1:1, and 5:1. Each sample was driven using an identical input pulse, for which the current flowing in the panel and the output voltage of the photodiode were measured for the panel reflexibility rate. Consequently, the drifting current initially exhibited a peak value and a saturated value at a later point. This value was proportional to the ratio of the charged particles, and it was similar to this ratio when it is higher than 1:1. The output voltage of the photodiode due to thepanel reflexibility rate was proportional to the ratio of the charged particles. However, the response speed decreased if the ratio was higher than 1:1. It is expected that the results of this study will contribute to the analysis of the charging of charged particles in electrophoretic-based electronic paper, and the selection of an appropriate concentration.",안형진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106493003

다양한 식물에서의 PDRN(Polydeoxyribonucleotide) 추출 수율 비교 및 상처치유 효능 분석,"PDRN (Polydeoxyribonucleotide) is a DNA-derived polymer that promotes self-renewal of damaged cells and tissues as a tissue regeneration active material. PDRN is a DNA fragment cut into small sizes by various physical or chemical methods. When administered to the body, PDRN binds and stimulates the adenosine A2A receptor on the surface of tissue cells to promote cell regeneration, accelerate wound healing, and reduce pain. Although PDRN is prepared from testis or semen of fish in most cass, PDRN extraction from various plants species was performed in the present study. Among 7 tested plant species, the highest DNA yield and purity was obtained form mugwort (Chrysanthemum coronarium, C.c), followed by broccoli (Brassica oleracea, B.o). Then, we evaluated the in vitro wound healing capacity of PDRNs prepared from these two selected plants. PDRN from C.c and B.o. significantly stimulated the wound healing process at ㎍/ml range.
