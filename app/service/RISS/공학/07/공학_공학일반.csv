This study investigates the influence of four behavioral types in MBTI (Myer-Briggs Type Indicator) and working conditions on organizational effectiveness. Job satisfaction and immersion have been regarded as a key conception of organizational effectiveness. The focus of this study is to investigate the effects of R&D employee's four behavioral types in MBTI and working conditions on organizational effectiveness. The results of this study show that organizational effectiveness is influenced by personality types and working conditions. According to the result, First, about the analysis of differences in job satisfaction, EP (Extraversion Perceiving)-type (3.56) and EJ (Extraversion Judging)-type (3.43) are higher than IJ (Introversion Judging)-type (3.07) and IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type (3.03) of four behavioral types in MBTI. So an enterprise makes various efforts to enhance job satisfaction for IJ (Introversion Judging)-type and IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type. Second, For improving the organizational effectiveness that is job satisfaction and immersion, an enterprise must make favorable working conditions to each four behavioral types in MBTI of R&D employees. In order to improve job satisfaction, the enterprise will provide IJ (Introversion Judging)-type with support for collegiality and IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type with good relationships with superiors. and also the enterprise gives autonomic authority to EJ (Extraversion Judging)-type. Finally, in the case of EP (Extraversion Perceiving)-type, the enterprise must admit failure for efforts. In order to improve job immersion, the enterprise will provide IP (Introversion Perceiving)-type with good relationships with superiors, the vision of company and compensation for creative work. and also the enterprise gives autonomic authority to EJ (Extraversion Judging)-type.",박정운,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60243403
"욕창 교육 프로그램이 간호·간병통합서비스 병동 간호사의 욕창간호 지식, 욕창예방 태도, 욕창 간호중재 수행도에 미치는 효과","The purpose of this study was to examine the outcomes of a pressure ulcer education program for nurses in comprehensive nursing care service units.

ESS 화재전용 소화약제 및 소화시스템 개발에 관한 연구,"This paper presents a study on the development of a fire extinguishing agent and extinguishing system for an energystorage system (ESS) fire. The fire extinguishing agent designed to extinguish an ESS fire is a highly permeable fireextinguisher that reduces the surface tension and viscosity while bringing about cooling action. This is the mainextinguishing effect of this type of wetting agent, which displays the characteristics of fire extinguishing agents used forpenetrating the battery cells inside the ESS module. For the fire extinguishing system, a local application system wasdesigned to suppress fire on a rack-by-rack basis. A 360° rotating nozzle was inserted into the rear hall of the ESS module,and general nozzles were installed in the rack to maximize the fire extinguishing effect. The fire extinguishing agent wasstrongly discharged by virtue of the gas release pressure. Experiments on fire suppression performance with ESS module1 unit and module 3 units showed that all visible flames were extinguished in 8 s and 9 s, respectively, by the fireextinguishing agent. In addition, based on confirming reignition for 600 s after the fire extinguishing agent was exhausted,it was confirmed that the ESS fire was completely extinguished without reignition in all fire suppression performanceexperiments.",이연호(Yeon-Ho Lee),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106816826

6세 이하 아동의 알레르기 질환과 영양섭취와의 관련성: 국민건강영양조사 2016-2019년 자료분석,"This study investigated the relationship between allergic diseases and nutritional intake in children under 6 years. Data were acquired from 1,977 children under 6 years of age who participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted from 2016 to 2019. Children with missing values in the diagnosis of allergic diseases were excluded. The data were analyzed by logistic regression using complex sample analysis in SPSS 26.0. Based on the presence of allergic diseases, the subjects were classified into two groups: allergic disease children (23.5%) and non-allergic disease children. Results of the univariate analysis revealed that allergic children tended to be older, males, taller, heavier, ate out more frequently, resorted to dietotherapy, and had higher levels of energy, calcium, iron, retinol, and saturated fatty acid intake (p<.05). Logistic regression analysis validated that the male sex, eating out, dietotherapy, high levels of energy, and saturated fatty acid intake were associated with a higher prevalence of allergic diseases (p<.05). Nutritional intake level was an important risk factor for allergic diseases in children. It is conceivable that nutritional factors affect the prevalence in different ways for each allergic disease. Further longitudinal studies are required to explore the mechanisms associated with the nutritional intake and allergy in children.",지은선,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108248169

SNS 마케팅 특성이 MZ세대의 비건 화장품 구매행동에 미치는 영향,"This study aimed to examine the generational differences in vegan cosmetics usage of the MZ generation recently emerging as the primary target group for such cosmetics and to investigate the effect of Social Networking Services (SNS) marketing on vegan cosmetics purchasing behavior. For this purpose, online and mobile surveys were conducted targeting Generation M, born between 1980 and 1995, and Generation Z, born between 1995 and 2004. The collected data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS WIN 25.0 program. According to the analysis results, both Generations M and Z showed a high response rate to having no experience in using vegan cosmetics, with Generation M displaying more experience than Z. Both generations showed high response rates to having experience in SNS marketing for vegan cosmetics, with Generation Z displaying more experience than M. However, both generations showed high response rates to having no purchasing experience after encountering SNS marketing for vegan cosmetics, with Generation Z displaying a lower purchasing experience than M. This means that effective SNS marketing leading to purchases for all MZ generations is needed. Additionally, reliability and information provision are the factors that positively affect vegan cosmetics purchasing behavior among SNS marketing characteristics. Therefore, marketers should develop content that can be trusted by SNS users encountering SNS marketing for vegan cosmetics and continuously provide vegan cosmetics information to affect vegan cosmetics purchasing behavior positively. Furthermore, more efficient marketing through understanding the MZ generation and targeting SNS marketing tailored to each generation in consideration of their characteristics will be needed.",이선민 ( Sun-min Lee ),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108346416

나노기술을 이용한 하이드로 젤의 개발,"Hydrogels have been used for various applications such as drug delivery, bioseparation, and sensors. A hydrogel is a three-dimensional network of a hydrophilic polymer, and it can absorb a large amount of water to exhibit soft physical properties which are similar to those of living tissues. These properties have made hydrogels as a useful constituent of biomedical devices. Hydrogels can be prepared via chemical or physical crosslinking, and the crosslinking density plays a critical role in the degree of swelling in water as well as other properties. Hydrogels with certain polymer chemistry and composition exhibit sensitivity (or responsiveness) to environmental stimuli, such as temperature, pH, ionic strength, and electric field. Recent advances in nanotechnology have brought new applications of hydrogels. The current technology allows preparation of nano-sized hydrogels for drug targeting into the specific site of action in the body, incorporation of inorganic/organic nanoparticles into hydrogels to endow with unique optical and electric properties, and precise molecular imprinting within hydrogels to provide shape-specific cavities or nanovacuoles. There is no doubt that a number of potential applications will emerge from hydrogels along with the
advances in nanotechnology. Current understanding and applications on hydrogels with
various functions are described here.",박재형,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82691474
