The data will be used as a basic material for research and marketing in the field of color consulting in the beauty industry. Collected data were statistically processed using the SPSS WIN program. Depending on the nature of the contents to be analyzed, either the percentage calculation or the Chi-square analysis or the ANOVA was carried out. The findings of the study are as follows; The overall recognition of the Personal Colors was generally low in terms of the knowledge, information and experiences. While the degree of recognition was the highest in teenagers, the necessity of diagnosing the Personal Colors was most deeply perceived by the women in their 30s. One of the factors for choosing a specific color for hair coloring was their favorite color for the teenagers, and the Personal Color or the advice of the professional for the women in their 30s. Meanwhile, the highest factor for those in their 20s was the colors in vogue. For the facial color make-up as well, this sensitivity to popular colors was also highest in the twenty-something women. The color choice in consideration of favorite colors and the Personal Colors was the most prominent in the teenagers. The tendency of utilizing the advice of sales people or the professionals was the highest in the women in their 30s. In the survey of satisfaction with the chosen colors for hair coloring and make-up, it was found that satisfaction was the highest in the cases of choosing the Personal Colors in all the age groups, while it was the lowest for the choice of popular colors.",한명숙,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30065961
탄소나노튜브로 코팅된 전도성 섬유의 제조와 특성 분석,"We have prepared conductive fibers by coating poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fibers with solutions composed of multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT), surfactant and binder, and characterized surface morphology and electrical properties of MWNT-coated PET fibers. FE-SEM images of MWNT-coated PET fibers confirmed that MWNTs were successfully coated on surfaces of PET fibers. It was found that MWNT-coated PET fibers prepared have maximum conductivities of ${\sim}10^0\;S/cm$. Even after abrasion tests, the electric conductivities of MWNT-coated PET fibers remained in the order of ${\sim}10^{-2}\;S/cm$, which was still much higher than the value (${\sim}10^{-13}\;S/cm$) of neat PET fibers.

수질 배출기준 및 세제 안전기준에 적합한 산업용 알칼리 세탁세제의 세척성과 세탁조건 연구,"Laundry industry has traditionally been considered an industry that generates large amounts of wastewater and Volatile Organic Compounds(VOCs). This is still the case until now. Household laundry detergents are produced and distributed within the safety regulations on the amount of harmful substances detected. While industrial laundry detergents are often distributed without safety regulations, and even laundry workers manufacture and use them on their own. This contaminates water and air and also threatens the safety of workers. This study is a basic study for distributing eco-friendly detergents(EFD-A) developed through previous studies to the laundry industry. Safety, washability and wastewater quality of EFD-A are evaluated. Three existing commercial detergents(PD1, PD2, LD4) are also evaluated to compare with EFD-A. The safety of detergents is confirmed by the content of optical brightener, VOCs, and arsenic. Washability is evaluated by the difference in reflectance of washed and unwashed artificial soiled fabrics according to detergent concentration, washing temperature, and washing time. TOC is used as the index of assessing the wastewater quality. The results are as follows; EFD-A doesn’t contain the optical brighteners, VOCs, and arsenic. The optimal washing conditions for EFD-A are 3 g/L concentration, 40 °C washing temperature, and 30 min washing time. The soil removal efficiency is about 71 %, which was similar to or somewhat superior to that of PD1, PD2, and LD4. TOC is 63.5 %, which is about 15 % lower than the discharge limit.

비극성 용매에 높은 용해성을 가지는 프탈로시아닌 유도체 합성 및 광학 특성에 대한 연구,"Phthalocyanine (Pc) exhibits excellent thermal, chemical, and physical stability, as well as outstanding absorption and emission properties, which are useful for its application in the fields of color filters, chemosensors, and photosensitizers. However, unsubstituted Pc is insoluble in common organic solvents due to its inherent intermolecular aggregation behavior, and thus needs to be finely dispersed in the presence of dispersants before use. In this article, we present a new Pc derivative, prepared by attaching long aliphatic groups at peripheral positions of Pc, which shows high solubility in most nonpolar solvents, leading to good optical properties. For its synthesis, dodecanyl-zinc Pc (dodecanyl-Zn-Pc) was prepared via direct tetramerization, starting with 4-dodecanyl phthalonitrile as the intermediate. Various characterization techniques were employed to estimate the structural and optical features of dodecanyl-Zn-Pc, including $^1H$ nuclear magnetic resonance, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, and ultraviolet-visual spectrophotometry and fluorimetry.

탄소섬유강화 복합재료의 열적 특성: 강화재의 단면형태에 따른 영향,"In this work, the effect of the cross-section of carbon fibers on the thermal characteristics of carbon fiber-reinforced composites has been investigated. The thermal characteristics of the composites are much affected by cross-sectional shape and heat treatment temperature of the reinforcements. In case of round shape carbon fiber-reinforced composites (R-CF/EP), the thermal anisotropic factor shows nearly 53, while that of hollow shape (H-CF/EP) and C shape (C-CF/EP) shows about 118 and 130, respectively. Therefore, both H-CF/EP and C-CF/EP have an excellent directional thermal conductivity to distribute heat above 200%. This result from the higher shear stress during spinning of anisotropic pitch-based hollow and C shape carbon fibers, which induce higher molecular orientation along the fiber axis than that in round shape fibers. And, with increasing heat treatment temperature, the thermal diffusivity of non-round types composites is much superior to that of round shape composites. This is probbly due to the rearrangement of molecular structure resulting in graphite-like structure and higher thermal conductivity along with the fiber axis direction. Also, the thermal anisotropic factor of the above systems follows the mixing law.",박수진,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101372851

The precise convergence tests were performed to obtaining reliable results. Equilibrium structure information of the (Ti1-xHfx)N was in a good agreement with previous results indicated the reliability of the results. The difference between the bulk moduli of TiN and HfN at 0 K and 3000 K is approximately 30 GPa, indicating that the elastic properties are not well maintained at high temperatures. At each temperature, the shear, and Young's moduli of (Ti0.5Hf0.5)N were greater than those of HfN. In addition, (Ti0.5Hf0.5)N maintained its high hardness, which was not significantly affected by temperature. As a result, ternary nitride, such as (Ti0.5Hf0.5)N, is a more promising material for extreme environments than a simple binary system.

Modulus of composites increased proportionally with increasing CNT content breaking stress tended to decrease except 1% CNT, and strain-at-break decreased gradually. However, composites using sonicated nanotube showed different mechanical behavior, and especially, their strain-at-break increased largely due to better dispersion of nanotube in PU. It was considered that tensile properties of composites were dependent on CNT content, dispersion of nanotubes in matrix, and phase separation between hard and soft segments of PU due to nanotube addition. With increasing CNT content, glass transition temperature and maximum loss tangent decreased and thermal stability improved.

The composite fibers were prepared by wet-spinning a mixture of the m-aramid and PYA solutions with methyl alcohol as a coagulant. The ratio of m-aramid to PYA was 10/90, 20/80, 30/70, 40/60, 50/50 wt%. The composite fibers had sea-island bicomponent structures; the island component was m-aramid and the sea component was PYA. The nano-sized m-aramid fibers were obtained by washing out PYA with boiling water. Phase separation in theses immiscible polymer solution blends led to m-aramid being extracted in a nano-sized fiber state. The diameter of the fibrillated m-aramid fibers decreased as the PYA contents increased (130~313 nm). This study provided a new method to make nano-sized m-aramid fibers with wet-spinning.",전언,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101373009
패션관련 전시회 참가기업의 참가행태 분석,"Various types of industry, from manufacturing industry to service industry, can be a subject of exhibition. So, subdivided studies about exhibition for each type of industry or field are necessary. However, there are still insufficient studies about them. Also, fashion industry related exhibitions should be classified differently from other industries' exhibitions because of their special features. Therefore, this study examines that how an exhibition is utilized as a promotion means of a company and the present condition of a fashion exhibition. It also compares a fashion exhibition with other industrial exhibitions to suggest the effective operations and the progressive promotion of the fashion exhibition. This study uses questionnaire from 140 companies for 5 exhibitions, which participated fashion related exhibitions. Data of this study is statistically analyzed using SPSS for window ver. 10.0 program. It also uses frequency, cross tabs, paired t-test, Independent Samples t-test. As a result of this study, fashion related companies' recognition of exhibitions has been increased. However, in terms of exhibition participation, attitudes such as pre-promotion or pre-education for the staff, who are in charge of the exhibition booths, and the outcome of the exhibition aren't maximized because the right under-standing concerning exhibitions is lacking and long-term preparation is insufficient. Also, advertisement for the exhibitions isn't enough because of insufficient preparation and absence of pre-promotion, so consultation with promising buyers can't be activated. Even though there are consultations, the consultations don't have much effect.",배종길,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45036569
셀룰로스 나노피브릴을 이용한 재활용 탄소섬유 습식부직포의 기계적 물성 연구,"Carbon fiber is an advanced material widely used in high-tech industries becauseof its light weight, heat resistance, chemical resistance, excellent mechanical properties, andelectrical and thermal conductivity. However, carbon fibers also have high production costsand limited disposal methods (e.g., landfills). Research is being conducted to address theseproblems through the recycling of carbon fibers. Among the representative recycled carbonfiber products, wet nonwoven fabrics have limitations in their mechanical propertiesbecause their structure simply consists of stacked microsized-diameter carbon fibers and abinder. In this study, the tensile strength was improved by adding cellulose nanofibrils(CNFs) during the manufacturing of wet nonwoven fabrics by mixing short-cut carbonfibers and a binder (short-cut PVA fibers). CNF bundles improve the mechanical propertiesby forming a complex structure via the crosslinking of carbon fibers and short PVA fibers.
The tensile strength of nonwoven fabrics consisting of short carbon fibers and PVA fiberswas determined to be 92 gf. On the other hand, the tensile strength of the nonwoven fabricwith 10% CNF added to the binder increased by approximately 20 times to 1,808 gf. Thecomposite with nanofiber was confirmed to be effective in forming a structure with highmechanical properties when fabricating microfiber-based nonwoven fabrics.",윤철민,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107292055

Maximum collagen content to produce the fiber was 30%, above which the fiber was found to be broken in the drawing process. Thermal and mechanical properties of the fibers were investigated by changing blend ratios of the PVA to collagen. Melting point of PVA was decreased with the increase of the amount of collagen. The strength and the elongation of the fiber were also decreased due to the inhomogeneous structure of the blend fiber. Hot water resistance was endowed by the heat treatment after drawing process, and when the fiber was treated at $230^{\circ}C$ for 10 minutes, it was neither swelled nor broken in boiling water.",박제기,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101372903

플라즈마 처리에 의한 폴리비닐리덴플로라이드 나노섬유의 젖음성,"Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) is a critical polymeric material used in the mass production and application of electrospun nanofibers, and is popular due to its excellent properties. However, electrospun PVDF nanofibers are very hydrophobic and possess low surface energies, limiting their broad application. In this work, we investigated practical methods for the hydrophobic surface modification of PVDF nanofibers using four techniques: radio-frequency (RF) and PIN-type atmospheric plasmas, planar inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and planar capacitively coupled plasma (CCP). The use of RF atmospheric plasma was ineffective under the experimental conditions used, while the PIN-type atmospheric plasma efficiently modified PVDF nanofiber surfaces locally. The application of planar CCP to PVDF nanofibers was more effective than planar ICP for the same experimental conditions. In particular, the water contact angles of samples treated with planar CCP for 600 s and 900 s were $25^{\circ}$ and $10^{\circ}$ respectively, and wettability improved. Analysis with FT-IR, XPS, and FE-SEM showed that the surface CF and CH hydrophobic groups were destroyed without damaging the PVDF nanofibers, and hydrophilic species such as C=O, OH, and COOH were formed. As a consequence, quantitative analysis of nanofiber chemical composition is necessary when treated by plasmas, providing insight into the correlation of specific property changes with processing conditions, and indicating precise research results and application examples.",이승훈,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105232944
폴리아미드 섬유의 개질에 관한 연구,"The effects of oxymethylation and chelation of nylon 6 were examined. The physical properties, antistatic effect, dyeing property, and heat-resistance of modified fibers were compared with those of the untreated control materials and with each other. The results obtained in this paper are follows: 1) Profitable results are obtained from the degree of oxymethylation in less than 35.5% on oxymethylated fiber. At 10.0~11.4% of degree of oxymethylation melting points of fibers are risen 2~4$^{\circ}C$, the other side tenacity and elongation of fibers are fallen a little. 2) By chelation, ZnCl2 treated fibers are observed increase of hydrophillic property and heat-resistance than Al2(SO4)3 treated fibers, i.e., 5~7% of increase in hygroscopicity and 7~8$^{\circ}C$ of melting point, while 2~3% of decrease in tenacity and elongation. 3) The antistatic effects of fibers are improved greatly by chelation of fibers, e.g., 0~0.015 KV of electric Potential difference are observed. And, also antistatic effects are slightly improved by oxymethylation. 4) The dye adsorption of nylon 6 are improved by oxymethylation, but chelated nylon 6 are poor in adsorption.

In particular, carbon nanotube paper (CNP)/polymer composites are potential candidates for lightweight multi-functional structural materials with high mechanical performances. CNP can be fabricated by filtering aqueous suspensions of CNT. We confirm that carbon aqueous dispersion can be manufactured using ultrasonication.
Our results showed dramatic improvements in electrical conductivity with a percolation threshold ~0.2% of CNT. By significantly improving the dispersion of CNT, we showed that only a very small amount of CNTs were needed to achieve the conductivity levels required for different electrical applications. In addition, we demonstrated that the aqueous dispersion of carbon fiber (CF) could be achieved using an ozone treatment; we also determined that CNT/CF paper could be fabricated by the wet laying of mixed CNT/CF aqueous dispersion as well. CNT/CF papers were embedded in epoxy resin by a resin infusion process to realize CNT/Epoxy composites.

These all except cotton/A fiber blend spectra were weight-nomalized to a sample weight of 2mg with the scaling function in the arithmetic command. The IR spectrum of cotton/A fiber blend was digitally subtracted with the normalized A fiber spectrum until A fiber component was removed completely i.e. the difference spectrum resembled the spectrum of cotton. When this subtracting operation was carried out, the scale factor(FCR)A, which meant the content of A fiber in cotton/A fiber blend, was also determined. After that, the difference spectrum was digitally subtracted with the normalized cotton spectrum until cotton copmponent was removed completely i.e. one could obtain the zero spectrum having the flat base line throughout all wavenumbers. When the second subtracting procedure was carried out, the scale factor(FCR)C, which meant the content of cotton in cotton/A fiber blend, was determinded. The contents of cotton and A fiber were calculated from these two scale factors.

전기방사 기술을 이용한 리튬 이온배터리 양극용 리튬-니켈-코발트 산화물 나노 구조체 제조 및 전기화학적 특성,"Lithium-ion batteries are products of next-generation energy storage technology that find various applications, e.g., in compact electronic devices and power sources of smart grids, because of their high energy density, low self-discharge, and long life cycles. To be utilized as a power source for a smart grid, lithium-ion batteries require not only a high energy density, but also a high power density. Power density is related to the amount of lithium-ion movement per hour and the surface area of battery electrodes. In this study, an electrospinning technique was used to fabricate a lithium-nickel-cobalt oxide nano-web (LNCOw) with a high specific surface area. The morphology of the LNCOw was investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), which showed that the LNCOw had an average fiber diameter of 350 nm.

Reduction and dyeing were carried out by one-step process using an infrared dyeing machine at the liquor ratio of 1:100, and subsequently oxidation and washing in water were followed. Dye uptake was increased with the increase of indigo concentration. Over the full range of dyeing tests, the dyeing condition was optimized to 40℃ for 40min. For most of dye concentrations, the cotton fabrics showed mainly PB color. Maximum K/S value was shown at 4g/L of sodium hydrosulfite concentration and the color strength increased with the increase of dye concentration. Value(lightness) decreased with the increase of dye uptake irrespective of mercerization or reduction method, while the mercerized cotton showed two times higher dye uptake than the untreated cotton. Whereas hue of the untreated cotton showed large decrease of P character(5.6~3.5 PB) with the increase of dye uptake, that of the mercerized cotton increased P character(4.7~5.5 PB). Irrespective of mercerization, value and chroma decreased with the increased of dye uptake. In addition, the untreated showed lower chroma than the mercerized cotton. In the case of traditional reduction, hue of the untreated cotton was changed very little with the increase of dye uptake. For hydrosulfite reduction, P character decreased with the increase of dye uptake. The difference of hue value was small with the change of reduction method(hydrosulfite reduction or traditional fermentation). Color character was not influenced by the changed maximum absorption wavelength. Washing fastness showed 4~4/5 shade change rating without any staining.
