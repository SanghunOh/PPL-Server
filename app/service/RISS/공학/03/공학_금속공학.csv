팽창흑연 복합소재를 이용한 리튬 배터리의 화재 및 열 폭주 억제 기술에 관한 연구,"In the rapidly growing electric vehicle battery market, the fire hazard caused by thermal runaway is an essential problem that needs to be solved. To prevent thermal runaway, many studies are being conducted, such as the development of effective thermal management systems, stabilization of electrolytes, use of new materials and designs for more stable battery manufacturing, and reduction of battery defects through manufacturing process improvements. Expanded graphite can withstand high temperatures, so it is widely used as a non-combustible material and a non-combustible coating compound. Composites prepared using expanded graphite form a thick air layer by the expanded graphite during a fire. As this air layer blocks high-temperature radiant heat generated by the fire, it can be applied as a non-combustible material or a fire and heat resistant material. In this study, a composite material consisting of expanded graphite was manufactured, and experiments were conducted to investigate its effectiveness in suppressing fires and thermal runaway in lithium batteries, utilizing the thermal physical properties of expanded graphite. We verified that this material can be a viable alternative for effectively blocking heat and preventing large-scale fires caused by heat transfer to adjacent batteries and continuous explosions.",임석대(Suk-Dae Lim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108668249

The overall results were came out as below. 1. When we dyed indigo, soppan wood, and turmeric, the fabrics which were dyed by using infrared ray dyeing machine showed higher color strength compared to ones that were naturally dyed. To be specific, Horizontal-type machine was more effective than Rotary-type machine in dyeing the material with higher color strength and evener level dyeing.

Results showed thatthe Zn-Al-Mg alloy coated steel had a much higher corrosion rate than GI coated steel in early stages ofcorrosion. With prolonged immersion, however, the corrosion rate of the Zn-Al-Mg alloy coated steelgreatly decreased, mainly owing to a significant decrease in the cathodic reduction reaction and an increasein polarization resistance at the surface. This was closely associated with the formation of protective corrosionproducts including Zn5(OH)8Cl2·H2O and Zn6Al2(OH)16CO3. Moreover, when the steel substrate waslocally exposed due to mechanical damage, the kinetics of anodic dissolution from the coating layer andthe formation of protective corrosion products on the surface of the Zn-Al-Mg alloy coated steel becamemuch faster compared to the case of GI coated steel.

The annealing heat treatments were performed at 675~795℃ in vacuum for 2 hours, followed by air cooling. The microstructure was observed by using an optical microscope and X-ray diffraction, and hardness was measured by using a Rockwell hardness tester and micro Vickers hardness tester. The average grain size becomes smaller at 675℃ to 735℃ due to the formation of new grains rather than grain growth, but becomes larger at 735℃ to 795℃ due to growth of the already-formed grains rather than formation of new grains. The mill annealing temperature becomes higher, the β phase fraction decreases and α phase fraction increases at room temperature. This is because the higher annealing temperature, the smaller amount of V present in the β phase, and thus the β to α transformation occurs more easily when cooled to room temperature. As the mill annealing temperature increases, the hardness value tends to decrease, mainly due to resolution of defects such as dislocations from 675℃ to 735℃ and due to grain growth from 735℃ to 795℃, respectively.

Cu-1.6Co-0.38Si 합금의 열처리에 따른 경도 및 전기전도도의 변화,"The Cu-Co-Si alloy shows high strength by forming precipitates by aging precipitation heat treatment of supersaturated solid solution treated with solution treatment such as Cu-Ni-Si alloy, and the Co<sub>2</sub>Si precipitated phase is dispersed in the copper matrix. The effect of aging treatment on the microstructure, mechanical and electrical properties of Cu-Co-Si alloys for electronic devices was investigated. As a results of SEM/EDS analysis, it was found that Co<sub>2</sub>Si precipitates of 30~300 nm size were distributed in grains. By performing the double aging treatment, it was possible to improve the strength and electrical conductivity by dispersing the fine precipitate evenly.

인산망간 피막의 아질산나트륨 첨가가 내식성에 미치는 영향에 대한 연구,"This paper describes an effective metal finishing technology for obtaining manganese phosphate coatings on steel. In this study, the effect of sodium nitrite addition on the corrosion resistance of a manganese phosphate coating was investigated. The microstructure, surface morphology, and chemical composition were analyzed by FE-SEM, EDS, and XRD, while the cross-sectional images and thickness of the coating layer were analyzed by FIB. According to the results of the EDS analysis, the main components of the manganese phosphate coating were C, O, P, Mn, and Fe. The XRD results showed that (Mn,Fe)5H2(PO4)4 4H2O in the manganese phosphate coating layer was formed by a chemical reaction between manganese phosphate and elements in the underlying carbon steel. Additionally, electrochemical polarization testing was carried out in order to evaluate the corrosion protection properties of the manganese phosphate coating in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. The corrosion resistance of the phosphate coating was remarkably improved by adding sodium nitrite.",민경섭(Kyong-Sub Min),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107074461
탄소섬유 열선의 스노우멜팅 데크 적용에 따른 열효율 및 열전달 해석 연구,"The development of floor decks is drawing attention, and an active movement to prevent slipping accidents due to freezing caused by snow or rain in the winter continues. This study was conducted to prevent slippage caused by freezing. As the heating wire becomes hot, it melts the ice on the floor, preventing slipping accidents during winter. Additionally, securing the safety of citizens and preventing fractures or bruises caused by sliding is possible. In particular, by comparing the temperature change between carbon fiber and iron chromium wire, carbon fiber shows approximately 22.2% higher thermal efficiency than iron-chromium wire, indicating the suitability of carbon fiber as a heating wire. ANSYS heat-transfer analysis was performed before product installation, and carbon-fiber heating wires were either placed in the center or arranged near the surface of the decks. Therefore, these carbon-fiber heating wires are installed on the deck to thaw the frozen parts, preventing slipping accidents.",김정근(Jeong-Keun Kim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108483891
미세 전극 패턴을 갖는 알루미나 정전척을 이용한 LED용 사파이어 기판 흡착 연구,"In this work, handling of sapphire substrate for LED by using an electrostatic chuck was studied. The electrostatic chuck consisted of alumina dielectric, which was doped with 1.2 wt% TiO₂. As the volume resistivity of alumina dielectric was decreased, the electrostatic force was increased by Johnsen-Rahbek effect. The narrower width and gap size of electrode led to the stronger electrostatic force. When alumina dielectric with 3.20×10¹¹Ωㆍ㎝ resistivity and 3 ㎜ width/1.5 ㎜ gap sized electrode was used, the strongest electrostatic force in this work was obtained, which value reached to ~14.46 gf/㎠ at 2.5 ㎸ for 4-inch sapphire substrate. This results show that alumina electrostatic chuck with low resistivity and fine electrode pattern is suitable for handling of sapphire substrate for LED.",김형주(Hyung-Ju Kim),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82660774

국가 장학금과 성적우수 장학금의 심리적 가치 및 저축성향과 소비지출에서 차이에 관한 연구,"In the present study, a line is drawn between the grade scholarship and state scholarship in an attempt to examine how the student recipients of a scholarship perceive the psychological value of the grant, for what purpose they seek to use it, and what implication such behaviors would have for management of scholarship. To achieve the goals, this research examined existing theories and developed hypotheses. On the basis of 98 questionnaires completed by undergraduate students of researcher-working university, the hypotheses were verified by using t-test of SPSS 18.0. The outcomes of the study could be summed up as follows: It is revealed from the study that the recipients of the grade scholarship feel higher psychological value than those of the state scholarship since the grade scholarship is regarded to be the due price for their efforts whereas the state scholarship is deemed to have little to do with the efforts invested. Stronger tendency is found to spend the grade scholarship for buying hedonic products than utilitarian products. The study also finds that there is little distinction between the grade scholarship and state scholarship in terms of the saving amounts. It seems thus necessary to lead students to spend the grade scholarship for buying utilitarian products needed for promotion of academic performance after saving certain amount of the grade scholarship.",박 환(Hwan-Park),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104089878

MZ세대 온라인구독서비스 선택과 지속이용과의 관련성 연구,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading many changes. At the center of this change is the MZ generation, which heavily uses smartphones. The MZ generation tends to have individual-seeking tendencies and to prefer shared consumption. Subscription service companies are trying to shift the consumption direction of Generation MZ toward the subscription economy. This study aims to analyze the current status of subscription services for college students in Daejeon, the center of the MZ generation, and to analyze the relationship between the selection of subscription services and continuous use based on this. Contents, providers, costs, convenience of use, and additional services were selected as selection factors for subscription services, and the impact of these factors on continuous use was analyzed. The results showed that content abundance, corporate brand, usage cost, convenience of use, and additional services were all affecting the continuous use set as factors. However, the degree of influence differed in the order of additional services, convenience of use method, cost of use, and abundance of corporate brands and contents. The results of this study are as follows. First, for Generation MZ, the use of online subscription services eventually lies in content consumption. Efforts are needed for the continuous quantity and quality of content. Second, the cost of use played an important role. The cost was maintained at approximately 10,000 won per month. However, considering the strong perception that Internet services are free, the opinion according to which Internet-based subscription services can be paid constitutes a different phenomenon than before. Third, additional services were found to have an extremely large effect on continuous use. If there are many additional services, the choice of subscription service also increases. As a result, this study analyzes the current status of subscription service use, focusing on college students in Daejeon, and examines the factors of their subscription service selection. Subsequent research conducted by further cultivating the age group beyond the regional limitations of college students in Daejeon would enable the provision of the possibility as a representative research result.",이종탁(Jong-Tak Lee),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108086172

열교환기의 해수냉각세관의 부식과 방식 ( 2 ),"The heat exchangers cooled by sea water are protected against corrosion by the current from the sacrificial anodes or the auxiliary anodes fixed to the inner surface of the water chests. But all areas of the inner surface of their cooling tubes can not be protected by the current. Therefore, metal tubes which are more anti-corrosive are to be used for those heat exchangers, or the inner surface of their cooling tubes are to be covered with the protective film made by ferrous ions (F^(2+)) which are produced by an electrolytic method or by adding some compounds. But the former is to reduce the heat conductivity, the latter is insufficient to the protection.
In this paper, a heat exchanger is made of the tubes whose metal are more heat-conductive but less anti-corrosive; the twisted tapes, heat transfer promoters, to both faces of which the insoluble linear auxiliary anodes made of the Pb-Ag alloy are fixed, are inserted into the cooling tubes; and the reference electrodes, small-unbroken natural sea water type AgCl electrodes, whose potentials are stabilized in sea water for a long period are fixed on the cooling tubes to enable to measure the potentials of the inner surface of the tubes, for the protective current density is controlled by its potential. An attempt is made to protect the inner surface of the sea water cooling tubes against corrosion directly by the external direct current. And an anti-biofouling device for the sea water pipe lines and the heat exchanger is made and is equipped on the sea water suction pipe line, and its characteristics are checked.
The results of the tests are as follows:
1. The inner surface of sea water cooling tubes can be protected satisfactorily against corrosion by the external current.
2. The distribution and the change of potentials on the inner surface of cooling tubes can be measured by the small-natural sea water type AgCl elecrodes.
3. The intial protective current density of any heat exchanger can be estimated by the results of the test.
4. The anti-biofouling device which has about 70% generating efficiency of the effective chlorine at 200mA/㎠, can be made in simple structure.",전대희,1981,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3268977
초고강도 자동차용 강의 환원정전류인가에 따른 산화 거동 변화 연구,"The change in the oxidation behavior of three types of B-added ultrahigh strength martensitic steels containing Ti and Nb induced by applying constant cathodic current was investigated. In a 3% NaCl+0.3% NH<sub>4</sub>SCN solution, the overall polarization behavior of the three alloys was similar, and degradation of the oxide film was observed in the three alloys after applying constant cathodic current. A significant increase in the anodic current density was observed in the Nb-added alloy, while it was diminished in the Ti-added alloy. Both Ti and Nb alloying decreased the hydrogen overpotential by forming NbC and TiC particles. In addition, the thickest oxide film was formed on the Ti-added alloy, but the addition of Nb decreased the film thickness. Therefore, it was concluded that the remarkable increase in the anodic current density of Nb-added alloy induced by applying constant cathodic current density was attributed to the formation of the thinnest oxide film less protective to hydrogen absorption, and the addition of Ti effectively blocked the hydrogen absorption by forming TiC particles and a relatively thick oxide film.",하헌영 ( Heon-young Ha ),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104893486
