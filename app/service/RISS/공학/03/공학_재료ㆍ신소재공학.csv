In hypothesis, the number of electron states should be limited by confining them to a state close to one-Dimension. Simultaneously, the electron-electron interactions should be frequent enough for the electrons to have liquid-like properties. As an example of implementing the hypothesis, our team reports the development of room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductivity of a material named LK-99 (superconducting compound name developed in the research), whose structure was revealed through numerous experiments with a clue found by chance.
Moreover, we summarize the theoretical and experimental basis for the characteristics and discovery of the world’s first superconducting material surpassing the critical temperature of 97°C at atmospheric pressure.",이석배,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108572700

The dissolution rate of metal from the electrodes was up to 90% in 2 M sulfuric acid with hydrogen peroxide (10 vol%) at 75 ℃, within 60 min. The improvement of dissolution by hydrogen peroxide seems to be due to reduction of Co(III) to Co(II), which can readily be dissolved.

"상온에서 증착한 ITO 박막의 급속 열처리 효과가 전기적, 구조적 특성에 미치는 영향","Abstract: Transparent and conductive Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) thin films were prepared on glass substrates at room temperature (RT) by a RF magnetron sputtering method. The ITO films sputtered at room temperature had an amorphous structure and uniform surface morphology with low planner density. We report the influence of rapid thermal annealing (RTA) treatment on the microstructure, optical and electrical properties of the ITO thin films. Rapid thermal annealing (RTA) was carried out for 2 min, 4 min, 5 min, 8 min and 10 min at 500 ℃ in 98%N2 + 2%H2 ambient gas. This study provides data about the microstructure and optical properties of ITO thin films with thicknesses of around 100 nm. The experimental results showed that the post growth RTA temperature has a significant effect on the properties of ITO thin films. The preferred orientation along the (222) plane, and the average grain size, measured from TEM micrographs, ranged from 5 to 30 nm. The average optical transmittance in a wavelength range of 200-800 nm increased from 74% to 88% after rapid thermal annealing at 500 ℃, where the highest value of the figure of merit was obtained. The resistivity decreased by 500 ℃ at 5 min, which was the annealing temperature, and after that the resistivity increased. The major factor of the resistivity change was the change of the carrier concentration. In addition to the increase in carrier concentration, RTA at 500 ℃ at 5 min caused the band gap energy of the ITO thin films to rise linearly.",김성진 ( Sung Jin Kim ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99708117

"STS 440C 마르텐사이트계 스테인리스 강의 열처리에 따른 미세조직, 기계적 특성 및 부식 거동","Martensitic stainless steel is commonly used in the medical implant instrument. The alloy has drawbacks in terms of strength and wear properties when applied to instruments with sharp parts. 440C STS alloy, with improved durability, is an alternative to replace 420 J2 STS. In the present study, the carbide precipitation, and mechanical and corrosion properties of STS 440C alloy are studied as a function of different heat treatments. The STS 440C alloy is first austenitized at different temperatures; this is immediately followed by oil quenching and sub-zero treatment. After sub-zero treatment, the alloy is tempered at low temperatures. The microstructures of the heat treated STS 440C alloy consist of martensite and retained austenite and carbides. Using EDX and SADP with a TEM, the precipitated carbides are identified as a Cr23C6 carbide with a size of 1 to 2 μm. The hardness of STS 440C alloy is improved by austenitization at 1,100 oC with sub-zero treatment and tempering at 200 oC. The values of Ecorr and Icorr for STS 440C increase with austenitization temperature. Results can be explained by the dissolution of Cr-carbide and the increase in the retained austenite.

This axe was decarburized to produce steel in an oxidizing atmosphere for a long time. However, cementite and malleable cast iron coexisted inside the axe because of an insufficient heat treatment time for decomposing cementite into ferrite and temper carbon. By contrast, the microstructure of the blade of the forged iron axe consisted of martensite formed by quenching.

전고체전지용 음극 소재의 연구 동향,"Recently, there has been significant research activity in the field of energy storage systems with a focus on improving the energy density and safety of Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The liquid-state electrolytes used in LIBs have several safety issues, including flammability and decomposition due to exothermic reactions during repeated cycles. Addressing the flammability issue is particularly important for the widespread adoption of eco-friendly electric vehicles. As a result, all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) that use stable and nonflammable solid-state electrolytes are being considered as an alternative solution. The use of solid-state electrolytes can also address concerns about thermal runaway, and research into adopting Li metal anodes is being conducted to achieve high-energy-density ASSBs. However, the problems of Li dendrite formation and solid electrolyte dissociation due to the reaction between Li and solid electrolyte still exist in ASSBs.

플라즈마 화학증착법에 의한 TiN 박막 밀착력에 Ti 중간층이 미치는 영향,"Adhesion is one of the most important properties of coated TiN layer for the wear resistant application. This study is focused on improving the adhesion of a TiN film grown by PECVD method. The adhesion was significantly affected by the microstructure of a Ti interlayer. In order to investigate a relationship between the adhesion and the microstructure of a Ti interlayer, the analyses of XRD, EDS and SEM were performed. As a pressure was decreased or the negative bias voltage was applied to the substrate while sputter-depositing a Ti interlayer, the degree of preferred orientation increased. The Ti film exhibited a preferred growth orientation of(002) which matches with TiN (111) plane coherently. It was found that the adhesion of a TiN layer decreased with increasing the degree of preferred orientation of a Ti interlayer. This tendency was explained with the phenomena of stress accumulation and relaxation at the interfaces. The adhesioin of the TiN film grown by PECVD was improved up to 45N when the crystallization and the preferred orientation of a Ti interlayer were suppressed by depositing at a relatively high pressure.",김선효,1992,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3233118
"인공 해수 중에서 탄소강의 부식특성에 미치는 합금원소 (Cr, Mn)의 영향","Effects of alloying elements, manganese and chromium, on corrosion resistance of carbon steel were examined using weight loss test and electrochemical tests (polarization test and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)) in synthetic seawater at 60 ℃. The results from the weight loss test showed that chromium effectively improved corrosion resistance of carbon steel during the entire immersion time, but manganese improved corrosion resistance after the lowered corrosion resistance at the beginnings of immersion. Unlike the weight loss test, the electrochemical tests showed that the corrosion resistance did not increase with immersion time, in all the specimens. This disagreement is explained by the presence of rust involved in electrochemical reaction during electrochemical tests. The analysis of rust with transmission electron microscopy (TEM)-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the amorphous-like rust layer located at the metal/rust interface with enriched alloying element (Cr, Mn) prevents diffusion of corrosive species into a metal/rust interface effectively, which leads to increased corrosion resistance. The initial corrosion behaviour is also affected by the rust types. In other words, manganese accelerated the formation of spinel oxides, negatively affecting corrosion resistance. Meanwhile, chromium accelerated the formation of goethite but impeded the formation of spinel oxides, positively affecting the corrosion resistance. From the above results, the corrosion resistance of steel is closely related with a rust type.(Received May 12, 2015)",현영민 ( Youngmin Hyun ),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101759148

The constitutive model involves statistically stored dislocation and geometrically necessary dislocation densities, which were incorporated into the Bailey-Hirsch type flow stress equation with six strength interaction coefficients. A strain-gradient term (called slip-system lattice incompatibility) developed by Acharya was used to calculate the geometrically necessary dislocation density. The description of Kocks-Argon-Ashby type thermally activated strain rate was also used to represent the shear rate of an individual slip system. The constitutive model was implemented in a user material subroutine for crystal plasticity finite element method simulations. The grain size dependence of the flow stress (viz., the Hall-Petch behavior) was predicted for a Ni-base polycrystalline superalloy NIMONIC PE16.

Due to the trace metal, even higher $CO_2$ uptake of $4.7mmol\;g^{-1}$ is also observed at 20 bar 298 K. Furthermore, the $CH_4$ storage capacity is $2.9mmol\;g^{-1}$ at 298 K and 20 bar. To evaluate the $CO_2$ separation performance, the selectivity based on ideal adsorption solution theory for $CO_2/CH_4$ binary mixtures on the presented porous materials is investigated.",정민지,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105549155
알루미늄 사형주조에서 기공 결함 감소를 위한 연구,"In this study attempted to prevent defects due to blow holes among defects of sand casting products. It was intended to reduce the defect rate by reducing the blow hole of the inner surface. Currently, expectations and requirements for the quality level of non-ferrous aluminum casting in the casting industry are increasing. In addition, the shape is complex and the shrinkage precision is required. Among them, the test prototype is expensive to manufacture the mold, and the production time is also long, and the product is manufactured by sand casting. At this time, the highest defect rates are defects caused by shrinkage defects, surface defects, and blow holes.. At this study, the manufacturing time was shortened by using the shape of the fluid movement path in advance. Also, it is possible to reduce defects due to blow holes.",이동연,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107299782
충격에 의해 손상된 섬유강화 열가소성 수지 복합재료의 재활용 횟수에 따른 물성의 변화,"In this study, the effect of mechanical and chemical properties of glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic (GFRTPs) according to the number of recycling was confirmed. The composite materials were manufactured through a hot press compression molding process using a glass fiber nonwoven fabric and a polypropylene film. Four specimens were named according to the number of recycled test repeat: First manufacture, 1st Recycle, 2nd Recycle, and 3rd Recycle. To investigate the mechanical properties of the prepared specimen, tensile test, flexural test, drop-weight impact test, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and field emission electron gun-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was performed. As a result, as the number of recycling steps repeat, the degree of crystallization, tensile strength, elastic modulus, and flexural strength were increased, but the impact properties were greatly reduced.",배곽진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108119066
Package - and Wafer - Level Electromigration Tests on Al - Cu Interconnect with Ti and TiN Underlayers,The effect of AI underlayer between Ti and TiN on the electromigration (EM) lifetime of Al stack film were compared with package-level and conventional wafer-level EM tests. The higher EM resistance of the Al stacks prepared with Ti underlayer can be best explained by their better Al (111) texture and grain size distribution than those with TiN underlayer. The surface roughness of the underlayer is related to the grain size distribution and surface roughness of Al film. The conventional wafer-level EM test results showed a similar trend with respect to Ti and TiN underlayers with less accuracy than those from package-level EM test results.,"Park, Young Bae",2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3205903
차세대 반도체 소자용 세라믹 박막의 전기적 분석 방법 리뷰,"Ceramic thin films are key materials for fundamental electronic devices such as transistors and capacitors which are highly important for the state-of-the-art electronic products. Their characteristic dielectric properties enable accurate control of current conduction through channel of transistors and stored charges in capacitor electrodes. The electronic conduction in ceramic thin films is one of the most important part to understand the electrical properties of electronic device based on ceramic thin films. There have been numerous papers dealing with the electronic conduction mechanisms in emerging ceramic thin films for future electronic devices, but these studies have been rarely reviewed. Another interesting electrical characterization technique is one based on electrical pulses and following transient responses, which can be used to examine physical and chemical changes in ceramic thin films. In this review, studies on various conduction mechanisms through ceramic thin films and electrical characterization based on electric pulses are comprehensively reviewed.",이동현(Donghyun Lee),2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107299326
유한요소법에 의한 수학적 모델링을 활용한 준-나노 CuxNiyZn1-x-yFe2O4 페라이트 연소합성,"Numerical modeling of the self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS) of Cu<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>y</sub>Zn<sub>1-x-y</sub> Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> ferrites was carried out using the finite element method, to control the combustion synthesis behaviors of the ferrites. Additional pre-heating above 300 ℃ caused the combustion temperature at the inner surface of the reactant compact to completely propagate the SHS reaction. The porous Cu<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>y</sub>Zn<sub>1-x-y</sub>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> ferrites formed by the SHS were ball-milled and then magnetically separated and classified to obtain quasi-nano-sized powders. The reitveld refinement estimated that the SHS product formed at room temperature was about 64% ternary ferrites, while that formed with 598 K preheating was about 85% ternary ferrites.

초고압 합성법으로 제조한 리튬이온전지 음극활물질 Li4Ti5O12의 전기화학적 특성,"Using a high pressure homonizer, we report on the electrochemical performance of Li4Ti5O12(LTO) particles manufactured as anode active material for lithium ion battery. High-pressure synthesis processing is performed under conditions in which the mole fraction of Li/Ti is 0.9, the synthesis pressure is 2,000 bar and the numbers of passings-through are 5, 7 and 10. The observed X-ray diffraction patterns show that pure LTO is manufactured when the number of passings-through is 10. It is found from scanning electron microscopy analysis that the average size of synthesized particles decreases as the number of passings-through increases. LiCoO2-based active cathode materials are used to fabricate several coin half/full cells and their battery characteristics such as lifetime, rate capability and charge transfer resistance are then estimated, revealing quite good electrochemical performance of the LTO particles as an effective anode active material for lithium secondary batteries.",지성화,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105434778
고온에서 Fe-C 합금 중 Zn의 열역학적 거동,"The distribution ratio of zinc between Ag-Zn and Fe-C-Zn alloys was measured to clarify the thermodynamic behavior of zinc in Fe-C melt at high temperatures. The activity coefficient of zinc in Ag-Zn alloy was preliminarily measured as a fundamental thermodynamic data for the activity of zinc in Fe-C melt. From the dependence of activity coefficient of zinc in Fe-C melt on temperature and carbon content, the following equation could be obtained at 1573-1623K:

스퍼터링공정변수변화에따른NiO박막의특성평가,"NiO thin films were deposited by radio frequency magnetron sputtering on glass substrates. The processing variables of the oxygen content, sputtering power, and pressure were varied to investigate the electrical properties and surface morphology of NiO films. It was found that the resistivity of NiO films at 1.22xl0(2) Ωcm (2.5% O2in Ar gas) was greatly reduced to 2.01x10(-1) Ωcm (100% oxygen) under a typical sputtering condition of 6 mTorr and 200 watts. In an effort to observe the resistivity variances, the sputtering power was varied from 80 to 200 watts at 6 mTorr with 100% O2. However, the resistivity of the NiO films changed in the range of 10(-1)-10(-2) Ωcm. The dependence on the sputtering power was therefore found to be weak in this experiment. When the sputtering pressure was changed from 3 to 60 mTorr at 200 watts with 100% O2, the resistivity of the NiO films showed the lowest value of 5.8xl0(-3) Ωcm at 3 mTorr, which is close to that of commercial ITO films (~10(-4) Ωcm). As the sputtering pressure increased, the resistivity also increased to 4.67 cm at 60 mTorr. The surface morphology of the NiO films was also checked by Atomic Force Microscopy. It was found that the RMS surface roughness values ranged from 0.6 to 1.5 nm and thtthe dependence on the sputtering parameters was weak.

PVP(polyvinylpyrrolidone)가 리버스 오프셋용 은 나노 잉크 물성에 미치는 영향,"Among the various roll-to-roll printing technologies such as gravure, gravure-offset, and reverse offset printing, reverse offset printing has the advantage of fine patterning, with less than 5 ${\mu}m$ line width. However, it involves complex processes, consisting of 1) the coating process, 2) the off process, 3) the patterning process, and 4) the set process of the ink. Each process demands various ink properties, including viscosity, surface tension, stickiness, and adhesion with substrate or clich$\acute{e}$; these properties are critical factors for the printing quality of fine patterning. In this study, Ag nano ink was developed for reverse offset printing and the effect of polyvinylpyrrolidone(PVP), used as a capping agent of Ag nano particles, on the printing quality was investigated. Ag nano particles with a diameter of ~60 nm were synthesized using the conventional polyol synthesis process. Ethanol and ethylene glycol monopropyl ether(EGPE) were used together as the main solvent in order to control the drying and absorption of the solvents during the printing process. The rheological behavior, especially ink adhesion and stickiness, was controlled with washing processes that have an effect on the offset process and that played a critical role in the fine patterning. The electrical and thermal behaviors were analyzed according to the content of PVP in the Ag ink. Finally, an Ag mesh pattern with a line width of 10 ${\mu}m$ was printed using reverse offset printing; this printing showed an electrical resistivity of 36 ${\mu}{\Omega}{\cdot}cm$ after sintering at $200^{\circ}C$.",한현숙,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105149160

오스테나이타이징 온도와 냉각 속도가 SCM415 저탄소강의 미세조직과 경도에 미치는 영향,"In this study, variations in the microstructure and hardness of a low-carbon SCM415 steel with austenitizing temperature and cooling rate are investigated. When the austenitizing temperature is lower than the A1 temperature (738.8 ℃) of the SCM415 steel, the microstructures of both the air-cooled and water-cooled specimens consist of ferrite and pearlite, which are similar to the microstructure of the initial specimen. When heat treatment is conducted at temperatures ranging from the A1 temperature to the A3 temperature (822.4 ℃), the microstructure of the specimen changes depending on the temperature and cooling rate. The specimens air- and water-cooled from 750 ℃ consist of ferrite and pearlite, whereas the specimen water-cooled from 800 ℃ consists of ferrite and martensite. At a temperature higher than the A3 temperature, the air-cooled specimens consist of ferrite and pearlite, whereas the water-cooled specimens consist of martensite. At 650 ℃ and 700 ℃, which are lower than the A1 temperature, the hardness decreases irrespective of the cooling rate due to the ferrite coarsening and pearlite spheroidization. At 750 ℃ or higher, the air-cooled specimens have smaller grain sizes than the initial specimen, but they have lower hardness than the initial specimen owing to the increased interlamellar spacing of pearlite. At 800 ℃ or higher, martensitic transformation occurs during water cooling, which results in a significant increase in hardness. The specimens water-cooled from 850 ℃ and 950 ℃ have a complete martensite structure, and the specimen water-cooled from 850 ℃ has a higher hardness than that water-cooled from 950 ℃ because of the smaller size of prior austenite grains.",이종언,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108212320
