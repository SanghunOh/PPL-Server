stress distribution, etc., and its effects are noticeable at around a radioactive waste repository located at
deep underground. In particular, the increase in permeability due to the formation of cracks may
significantly increase the amount of groundwater inflow and the possibility of radioactive nuclide outflow.
In this study, FLAC2D and FLAC3D were used to analyze the mechanical and thermal behaviors for
three categories: a)No EDZ, b)Uniform EDZ, and c)Random EDZ. It was found that the tunnel
displacement in the Random EDZ case was 423% higher than that in the No EDZ case and was 16%
higher than that in the Uniform EDZ case. Tunnel inflow in the Random EDZ was also 17.3% and 10.8%
higher than that in the No EDZ and the Uniform EDZ case, respectively. The permeability around the
tunnel was increased by up to 10 times in the corner of the tunnel wall and roof due to the stress
redistribution after excavation. From the computer simulation, it was found that the permeability around
the tunnel wall was partially increased but the overall tunnel inflow was decreased with increase of stress
ratio. Mechanical analysis using FLAC 3D showed similar results. Slight difference between 2D and 3D
could be explained with the development of plastic zone during the advance of tunnel excavation in 3D.",이지원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108761083
국내 고령토의 녹조제거 활용 가능성 연구 - 황토와의 비교,"Applicability of kaolin as a substitute of yellow clay, which is used in removal of green algal bloom, was investigated. Soil texture, CEC, particle distribution, and zeta potential of kaolin appeared similar to those of yellow clay. Yellow clay contained higher concentrations of P2O5 and some heavy metals than kaolin does.
Spray experiments were conducted for natural algae using both materials with particle size of 0.18~2 mm and <0.18 mm. The concentrations of chlorophyll-a and nutritive salts were monitored at 0, 20, and 60 minutes. While 0.18~2 mm yellow clay showed the highest chlorophyll-a removal efficiency when yellow clay was sprayed at 10 g/L injection rate for 60 minutes, kaolin yielded a faster removal with the lower injection rate. Kaolin showed the higher efficiency than yellow clay did in removal of total phosphorous and nitrogen at 0.5, 2.5, and 5 g/L spraying. The results indicated the prospective applicability of kaolin in practical removal of algal bloom in streams and lakes.",박형준,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104637696
탄소배출권 및 세액공제에 따른 그레이수소 및 블루수소의 경제성 분석,"Economic and sensitivity analyses of grey and blue hydrogen were conducted using statistical data from the United States. This study indicated that the production costs of grey and blue hydrogen were 1.519 and 1.568 $/kg H2, respectively. The blue hydrogen would be more economically attractive than the grey hydrogen if the carbon credit was higher than 32.3 $/ton CO2, tax credit was higher than 70 $/ton CO2, or maximum tax credit period was longer than 14.6 years. In the sensitivity analysis, the production cost of the blue hydrogen was most sensitive to the maximum tax credit period, followed by tax credit, and carbon credit, in order of sensitivity. Thus, volatility of the carbon and tax credits should be considered in the economic analysis of the blue hydrogen because they have a major impact on the its production cost. In addition, the unit import costs of the blue hydrogen for hydrogen carrier types were 2.716, 5.205, 3.232 $/kg H2 for liquid organic hydrogen carriers, liquefied hydrogen, and ammonia, respectively.",오현민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108565371
북한의 광물자원산업 실태와 남북협력 방안,"The production of mineral resource and its industries such as steel making and smelting have deteriorated in North Korea although it has a plenty of mineral resources. Under the North’s new circumstance of the investment, the resources cooperation between two Koreas could become the win-win strategy. Resource cooperation of South-North need to be focused at not only resource development but also mineral industry. In South Korea, the resource demand will increase mostly in the 4th industries. On the other hand, in North Korea, it would increase mostly in the construction, civil engineering, heavy industry and infrastructure. Differences in the structures of the demand as well as supply of mineral resources between two Koreas could make an environment to increase the effects of the cooperation. Independent mineral industry value chain would be created in the Korean peninsula when mineral resource of the North and smelting and manufacturing industry of the South are connected.

Standard (or conventional) induction logging devices usually incorporate one transmitter coil and one or a number of receiver coils (all of which are oriented along the tool axis), being sensitive only to the horizontal formation resistivity in vertical wells. We simulate and analyze induction logging measurements in a typical formation model of Korea using a standard induction tool. Numerical tests analyze effects of the diameter or/and mud resistivity of borehole on induction logging measurements. Further, we compare responses of induction and (short and long) normal logging to the typical formation model under consideration.

A Study on Optimal Conditions of Ceramic Support Process for Recycling of Spent Foundry Sand,"Characteristics of ceramic support made by spent foundry sand-loess mixtures are investigated by bulk density, porosity, durability, and compressive strength. And the basic properties of SFS and loess are estimated. The effect of drying time after cutting process, elevated temperature time, sintering temperature, and sintering time is also estimated to obtain the optimal condition in the process of manufacture ceramic supports. From the basic properties of SFS and loess, the content of $SiO_2$ in furan sand is much higher than that in loess but the content of $Al_2O_3$ and $Fe_2O_3$ in furan sand is much lower than that in loess. In order to make ceramic supports, cylinder shape is the most desirable to sustain the properties of ceramic support. If annulus shape has an enough compressive strength, however, annulus shape may be decided. For the optimal condition to manufacture ceramic supports, drying time after cutting process is decided to 24 hrs and elevated temperature time is decided by 9hrs. And sintering temperature and sintering time are decided to $900^{\circ}C$ and 9hrs, respectively in order to prevent solidification of sand materials.","Rhee, Seung-Whee",2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101237214
세계 탄소중립 전략 및 기술 고찰,"Declarations of achieving carbon neutrality are made by world leaders to prevent the climate change crisis and global warming. While direct regulatory measures for reaching carbon neutrality, such as market-based mechanisms, do exist, there may be limits to their use. Governments are now advocating for energy transitions, which involves replacing most of their electricity demand with renewable energy, hydrogen and nuclear power generation instead of fossil fuel power generation, and replacing non-electric energy demand with hydrogen energy. In this paper, we review the projected decline of fossil fuels in the current energy transition period and the characteristics of new and renewable energy predicted to replace them.

To evaluate the long-term geological evolution of the natural barriers, it is essential to analyze the long-term behavior of rock joints, including the frictional healing behavior. This study aimed to experimentally analyze the frictional healing behavior of rock joints under hydro-mechanical (H-M) conditions through the slide-hold-slide (SHS) test.
The SHS tests were performed under mechanical and H-M conditions for joint specimens of different roughness. In the H-M conditions, the frictional healing rate tended to increase, which was more evident in the specimens with large roughness. In addition, it was confirmed that the effect of the hydro-mechanical conditions was more significant when the effective normal stress acting on the joint surface was small.

As results of chemical analysis, relative extraction ratio(RER) defined as elements extracted by extractant divided by those by aqua regia for As and heavy metals in the samples increased in the order of 0.01M CaCl2 < 1M MgCl2. The RER values for Cd were relatively higher than those for As, Cu and Pb due to their differences in geochemical mobilities.

고준위방사성폐기물 처분시설 부지선정 방식 해외사례 분석,"Site selection processes for high-level radioactive waste disposal facilities in different countries differ in terms of local geology and degree of public engagement. There seem to be three alternative processes for site selection: (1) selection with community consent after government choice; (2) selection with continuous community engagement after exclusion of unsuitable areas based on existing survey data; or (3) site selection where communities have expressed a willingness to participate. The Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, USA, was selected as the final disposal site by process (1) through six stages, but its development was suspended owing to opposition from the local governor and environmental groups. In Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany, process (2) is used and sites are selected through three stages. Sweden and Switzerland have completed site selection, and Germany is currently engaged in the process. The UK adopted process (3) with six stages, although the process has been suspended owing to poor community participation.

Urban mining technologies targeted at the abandoned mine area constitute screening, extraction, and smelting for recycling waste products. By analyzing the technologies available, an industrial network can be developed for recycling waste batteries and catalysts, which are promising raw materials. It is also important to establish an appropriate location for related industries that can generate value-added resources, rather than the resource supply and demand conditions seen in general urban mines.

물리정보신경망을 이용한 파동방정식 모델링 전략 분석,"The physics-informed neural network (PINN) has been proposed to overcome the limitations of various numerical methods used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) and the drawbacks of purely data-driven machine learning. The PINN directly applies PDEs to the construction of the loss function, introducing physical constraints to machine learning training. This technique can also be applied to wave equation modeling. However, to solve the wave equation using the PINN, second-order differentiations with respect to input data must be performed during neural network training, and the resulting wavefields contain complex dynamical phenomena, requiring careful strategies. This tutorial elucidates the fundamental concepts of the PINN and discusses considerations for wave equation modeling using the PINN approach. These considerations include spatial coordinate normalization, the selection of activation functions, and strategies for incorporating physics loss. Our experimental results demonstrated that normalizing the spatial coordinates of the training data leads to a more accurate reflection of initial conditions in neural network training for wave equation modeling. Furthermore, the characteristics of various functions were compared to select an appropriate activation function for wavefield prediction using neural networks. These comparisons focused on their differentiation with respect to input data and their convergence properties. Finally, the results of two scenarios for incorporating physics loss into the loss function during neural network training were compared. Through numerical experiments, a curriculum-based learning strategy, applying physics loss after the initial training steps, was more effective than utilizing physics loss from the early training steps. In addition, the effectiveness of the PINN technique was confirmed by comparing these results with those of training without any use of physics loss.",조상인,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108736425

In particular, in the case of structures with severe deformation of damage, there is a risk of deterioration in stability and disaster due to changes in the load distribution characteristics in the structure, so rapid structure demolition technology that can be efficiently dismantled in a short period of time is drawing attention. However, structural deformation such as unauthorized extension or illegal remodeling occurs frequently in many old structures, which is not reflected in structural information such as building drawings, and acts as an obstacle in the demolition design process.
In this study, as an effective way to overcome the discrepancy between the structural information of old structures and the actual structure, access to actual structures through 3D modeling was considered. 3D point cloud data inside and outside the building were obtained through LiDAR and drone photography for buildings scheduled to be blasting demolition, and precision matching between the two spatial data groups was performed using an open-source based spatial information construction system. The 3D structure model was completed by importing point cloud data matched with 3D modeling software to create structural drawings for each layer and forming each member along the structure slab, pillar, beam, and ceiling boundary.

The mixing ratios of the soil neutralizer were 0.6%, 1.0%, 1.2%, and 1.6% in comparison with the soil weight. All soil neutralizer treatments promoted RCD growth and survival of P. densiflora seedlings and the inflow of herbaceous vegetation from the forest edge. In addition, soil pH was improved by the soil neutralizer treatment. Treatment with 1.6% soil neutralizer resulted in increased RCD growth of P. densiflora seedlings, total population of herbaceous plants from around the forest, TOC, and total N. In this study, the mixing ratio showed a positive correlation with RCD growth and survival of P. densiflora seedlings, the inflow of herbaceous vegetation, soil pH, and TOC.

To verify the reliability and accuracy of the results obtained by p-XRF in the field, certified reference materials were prepared as glass beads and analyzed together with samples. The results showed that the overall contents of each element were generally lower in wet samples than in pulp samples, and the trend in the element content by depth was related to the degree of weathering of the laterite. For the element of interest, Ni, correction was performed using Ni-Fe correlation and the calculated values were found to be similar to the lab-XRF results. The derived correction coefficient was applied to another borehole sample to confirm its applicability to other boreholes. The corrected values of the wet samples showed a decrease in the deviations from lab-XRF data, confirming the validity of the correction method.",김은주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108565376
