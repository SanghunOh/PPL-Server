The reactions were conducted in annular reactor equipped with a low pressure mercury multilamp (8W x 6) and initial concentration was 10ppm.",유의연,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3145621
Pt 및 Pt-Pd 촉매에 있어서 일산화탄소 산화반응에 관한 연구,"This study is concerned with the oxidation of carbon monoxide on Platinum and Platinum -Palladium catalysts. Catalysts were made by the impregnation method and flow reactor was used in the catalytic reaction. As for the mixed gases, carbon monoxide concentration varied from 1 to 4% and that of oxygen from 1 to 4%. Na was used as carrier gas and GHSV varied from 24,000h-1 to 60, 000h-1. The temperature range was from 200 to 600℃. It was also taken into consideration that the heat and mass transfer resistance of cur catalysts was negligible in the study. Experimental results showed that Platinum-Palladium catalyst was about 1.5∼3.90 superior to Platinum catalyst in conversion yield. When we used Platinum-Palladium catalyst, we observed that carbon monoxide oxidation was found to be 1st order with respect to carbon monoxide concentration. Activation energy of Pt-Pd catalyst was 23.5kcal/mol.",김경림,1982,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3224482
Short n-channel MOSFET의 특성,Short n-channel metal gate MOSFETs have been fabricated with the channel length of 1 um. The source and drain were formed by implanting As with the energy of 150 keV and the dose of 5 x 10^15/㎠. And Boron was implanted into the channel to define the enhancement mode. Photolithography technique was used to define each pattern. The experimental value of threshold voltage of short channel device was about 0.8v. And it was suggested that Yau's model structure could be used to calculate the threshold voltage of short channel device. The drain characteristics and the mobility versus gate voltage were also obtained.,李德東,1982,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19649842
초경량 실리카 에어로젤 초단열재의 현황 및 전망,"Since nanoporous silica aerogel was first synthesized in 1931, its potential as an ultra-lightweight superinsulation material has been steadily attracting attention. Silica aerogel is the best thermal insulation material to date. However, the potential applications of this lightweight material have so far been hindered by its inherent fragibility and brittleness arising from its ultra-porous nature. Although the monolithic form of silica aerogel has the best ultra-lightweight superinsulation properties, it cannot be used in this form. Instead it is used in the form of powders, particles, and blankets. However, these forms still have shortcomings. Silica aerogel is most widely applied in the form of a fiber-reinforced aerogel blanket, but this form is likely to generate dust when handled. Although silica aerogel particles have been proven to be non-toxic to humans, dust formation remains a major barrier to the widespread application of silica aerogel blankets. This paper will investigate the unique properties of silica aerogel and determine what fields it can be used in or potentially be used in due to its unique properties. In addition, we will review the important advances in silica aerogel synthesis technology and its commercialization so far, and then consider the problems that exist for its widespread commercialization in the future and how to overcome them.",서동진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108401978
