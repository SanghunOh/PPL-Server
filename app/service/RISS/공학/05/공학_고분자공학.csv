It has been reported that nine proteins in marine blue mussel, often referred to a representative mussel, contribute to form mussel byssal threads and plaques. DOPA containing two hydroxy groups called cathecol is recognized that it plays a major role in adhesion as well as cohesion process within byssal structure. In this paper, adhesion and cohesion mechanisms were introduced and evaluated by supportive literature published during last decade. Diverse applications of cathecol chemicals were also examined in terms of innovative adhesive, bioadhesive and challenging material for tissue engineering. It is noticeable that reconsideration of mussel proteins could provide the various opportunities as biomaterials.",강병언(Byoung Un Kang),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105277981
Biodegradability of Poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/Lactic Acid (LA) Blends Using Anaerobic Digester Sludge,"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) has been highlighted for its excellent biodegradability and hydro-degradability.
On the other hand, an estimation of the biodegradability of PLA generally requires lengthy measurements over several months because it is difficult for the terminal decomposer, a microorganism, to uptake and utilize the polymer material, making it difficult to analyze and compare the results quantitatively. In this study, it was hypothesized that the inclusion of mono lactic acid (LA) in a PLA blend improves the level of microbial attachment to the surface of the PLA blend, and increases the biodegradation rate. PLA blend films containing 1%, 2.5%, and 5% of LA were prepared, and their morphological changes to the surface and cross section of films were investigated. The biodegradation of a PLA/LA blend using digester sludge was estimated quantitatively from the specific gas production rate (SGPR) based on the surface area of the blend film. The physical and chemical properties before and after biodegradation were also compared.
These results show that PLA/LA blends with a controlled degradation rate can be developed by incorporating readily degradable chemicals, and implemented as environmentally friendly plastics and polymers.",이재춘,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103635664
고분자 물질의 화장품 응용,Polymers in cosmetics are used to deliver desired attributes to skin and hair. Precisely constructed block and graft copolymers widen the range of available mechanical properties and compatibilities. Stimuli responsive hydrophobic polymers can be triggered to become hydrophilic by changes in their environment and this can confer waterproof properties at low temperature and easy water removal at higher temperatures. Transfer-resistant cosmetics can be possible due to silicone resins. The control of rheology properties in cosmetics gradually continue to be easy with copolymers. Durability of colors and fragrances for rinse-off products can be enhanced by delivery systems from complex coacervates. Polymeric anti-microbials promise product preservation while minimizing the concern of skin permeation. This article reviews recent trends in the use of polymers in cosmetics.,조완구 ( Wan Goo Cho ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99962983
Protocol for Recovery of a Rat Tibia Fracture through 3D-PrintedPLA-Scaffold Implantation,"One of the more recent fracture-healing methods comprises applying patient-specific 3D printing. An optimal fracture-healing method would accurately print and embed a customized implant at the defect site of the fracture. In this study, to provide a standardized 3D printing process, the entire process of making a fracture model, manufacturing the customized 3D printing, and implanting the result was conducted through animal experiments. A fracture treatment 3D printing process was established and a fracture model was produced. X-ray and micro-computed tomography (CT) images were acquired and the portions with the fractured bones were extracted by segmentation and reconstruction using image preprocessing software. Based on this, 3D modeling of the fracture site scaffold was performed, and the 3D printing protocol was experimentally verified through polylactic acid (PLA)-based 3D printing and implantation at the fracture site. The entire process of making the fracture model, manufacturing the customized 3D-printed bone fragment, and implanting it in the defect site was performed based on 3D printing. There is a need for further animal clinical validation and histological studies on the fracture recovery process according to 3D printing protocols. Nevertheless, this approach (performing the implantation process of a customizable 3D printing scaffold for replacing atypical fractures using X-ray and micro-CT images) is expected to play a new role in fracture treatment.",( Dae Ok Kim ),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108277648

해양유래 천연생물자원의 바이오3D프린팅 활용,"In this review, it is described the recent trends in materials and applications of the marine natural biological resources for the bio 3D printing technology. The bio 3D printing is additive manufacturing technology through living cell and scaffold as supporting materials such as collagen, chitosan and alginic acid as marine-derived natural biomaterials. It is known to be useful for biomaterial because of its high biocompatibility, biodegradability and low toxicity. Collagen have been widely used to bio 3D printing scaffold known to improve the wound repair since they can stimulate various cellular activities including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and even guidance of near cells to work as normal tissues functionally. Chitosan is widely used for preparing scaffolds for regenerative medicine because of its ability to bioresorption and biocompatibility. There are known the research in which lyophilized chitosan scaffolds were successfully tested as candidates for tissue regeneration. In addition, alginates are known to be able to fulfill the considerable requirements for suitable bioink formulation, a critical component of efficient 3D bioprinting. Taken together, through the research on 3D bioprinting using marine-derived natural materials such as collagen, chitosan, and alginic acid, it is expected to be applied to biocompatible 3D printing materials for various biomedical applications.",문연희,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106640181
ATR FT-IR과 pyro-GC/MS를 이용한 다층박막필름의 분석,"The material constitution of multi-layered thin film coated on the PET base film was analyzed using ATR FT-IR and pyro GC/MS combination. The cross section of the film was acquired by cracking the film after dipping in liquid nitrogen and was observed using optical microscope. Total thickness of the coated film was 70μm and three layers were observed. Since each layers were too thin to analyze directly except the surface layer, analyzable area of each layers were exposed by using a proper solvent and were investigated using ATR FT-IR and pyro GC/MS. Results shows that three layers were commonly consisted of urethane-acrylate copolymers. Also, inorganic and/or metal inclusions detected by XPS and SEM-EDAX were exhibited by nano size SiO2 particles in layer① and aluminum flakes in layer②.",박성일,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106385845
고분자 생체재료와 줄기세포를 이용한 조직공학과 재생의학의 최신 동향,"Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies could offer new hope for patients with serious tissue injuries or end-stage organ failure. Scientists are now applying the principles of cell transplantation, material science, and engineering to create biological substitutes that can restore and maintain normal function in diseased or injured tissues/organs. Specifically, creation of engineered tissue construct requires a polymeric biomaterial scaffold that serves as a cell carrier, which would provide structural support until native tissue forms in vivo. Even though the requirements for scaf-folds may be different depending on the target applications, a general function of scaffolds that need to be fulfilled is bio-degradability, biological and mechanical properties, and temporal structural integrity. The scaffold`s internal architecture should also enhance the permeability of nutrients and neovascularization. In addition, the stem cell field is advancing, and new discoveries in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine will lead to new therapeutic strategies. Although use of stem cells is still in the research phase, some therapies arising from tissue engineering endeavors that make use of auto-logousadult cells have already entered the clinic. This review discusses these tissue engineering and regenerative medicine strategies for various tissues and organs.",이상진(Sang Jin Lee),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100602560
저장기간에 따른 키토산 첨가 매작과의 품질특성,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the quality characteristics of Korean Traditional Fried Cookie(Maejakgwa) prepared with various concentrations of chitosan(0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5%). Moisture contents of maejakgwa was lower as the additive increased. As the chitosan content increased, pH and acidity were increased. 2.2-diphenyl-1-picryl hydrezyl(DPPH) radical scavenging activity was improved significantly the addition of the chitosan and decreased as storage period increased. Thiobarbituric acid(TBA) value was lower in maejakgwa made with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5% chitosan than in the control. Color value of maejakgwa showed decreased L ** value and ad increased a * and b ** value with increasing chitosan concentrations. The hardness of maejakgwa was increased with the increase of storage period and increased with increase of chitosan. The total viable cells in the maejakgwa with chitosan showed 6.2~6.6×10 CFU/g which was the lowest in the beginning of storage period but as the storage period was longer, the total viable cells increased in all of the samples. In the sensory evaluation, the maejakgwa prepared with 3~5% added chitosan received higher acceptance scores for the properties of appearance, flavor, taste, texture(crispness, adhesiveness) and overall acceptability. The results show that addition of the chitosan to foods with fat such as maejakgwa a would be a useful way to enhance the antioxidant quality, sensory characteristics and shelf life.",박금순 ( Geum Soon Park ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82704579
