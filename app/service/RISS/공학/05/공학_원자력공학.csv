As a result, their qualities of life of the patients that had radiation therapy was the lowest right after the therapy, and gradually increased after the end of the therapy. However, after six months, their quality of life failed to reach the same level before the therapy. They had depression and side effects the most right after the therapy, and somewhat reduced them after the end of the therapy. In case of surgical operation, the more they were educated, the more they had psychosocial adjustment, and the more they had a medical examination and took out an insurance policy, the more they had psychosocial adjustment. In case of chemotherapy, their cognitive function is influenced so that they have impairments in memory, learning, and thinking stages. Since subjective cognitive impairment has a relationship with depression, it is necessary to monitor depression of chemotherapy patients. Given the results of this systematic meta-analysis, when three types of therapies (surgical operation, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) are applied to patients with breast cancer, it is necessary to recognize their psychosocial adjustment, depression, anxiety, and quality of life in the nursing and radiation therapy fields and thereby to introduce an intervention program for a holistic approach.",양은주,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106344431

팔꿉관절 측방향 일반촬영에서 아래팔뼈 각도 변화에 따른 영상 분석 : 위팔뼈 위관절융기와 팔꿉관절 평가,"Clear overlapping of the bilateral epicondyle and proper separation of the elbow joint are crucial for obtaining accurate lateral general radiographs of the elbow. However, due to the complex anatomical structure of the elbow, achieving optimal positioning is challenging, leading to the need for repeated x-ray examinations. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the angle of the forearm in patients where accurate lateral images of the elbow joint can't be obtained after vertical incidence using a styrofoam device during elbow joint lateral x-ray imaging. Twenty patients were enrolled in our study following the established protocol. First, a vertical x-ray at an angle of 0° between the forearm and the table was taken (control group). Here, if the lateral image of the elbow joint was deemed inadequate, the forearm angle was adjusted using custom-made styrofoam supports with 5° and 10° inclinations (experimental groups). For the evaluation method, two assessors utilized a 5-point Likert scale to assess the images. The reliability of the assessments was analyzed using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. As a result, patients with inadequate overlap of the bilateral epicondyle and separation of the elbow joint in the initial examination (control group) were able to obtain the best images when setting a 10° angle between the forearm and the table. The subjective evaluation was 1.6 ± 0.8 points at 0°, 2.7 ± 0.8 points at 5°, and 4.4 ± 1.3 points at 10°, respectively. The reliability analysis for the angles of 0°, 5°, and 10° yielded Cronbach's alpha values of 0.867, 0.697, and 0.922, respectively. In conclusion, when it is not possible to obtain accurate images using the conventional position and X-ray beam direction, it is considered that by initially acquiring images with an angle of 10° between the forearm and the table, and gradually decreasing the angle while obtaining images, it would be possible to achieve the optimal image while reducing the number of repeat examinations.",신효수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108737159

The prevention and management of coronary artery disease seems to require the control of glucose and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Although it is not statistically significant with other hematological factors, the need for management of coronary artery disease was identified. the coronary computed tomography angiography of coronary artery has higher radiation doses than other CT scans. Therefore, for the purpose of screening, coronary computed tomography angiography should be considered in consideration of the sex and age of the examinee, and detection of coronary artery disease through other non-invasive tests should be prioritized over coronary computed tomography angiography.",최민경,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106498986

일반촬영에서 kVp와 mAs의 변화에 따른 농도와 환자 선량 비교,"Low energy x-rays that occur in the low tube voltage radiography of general radiography are absorbed strongly in the body and do not aid image quality enhancement. This study maintains titer in general radiography while using tube current that are proportional to density and the tube voltage 15% principle according to density to reduce patient exposure doses, and area doses and entrance surface doses were measured to compare patient exposure doses. In hand, knee, abdomen, and skull radiography, kVp was increased to 115% and mAs was decreased to 50% and kVp was decreased to 85% while mAs was increased to 200% and area doses and entrance surface doses were measured to compare relative doses. Also, 5 places in each image were set, density was measured, and Kruskal wallis H test was conducted to observe significance probabilities between groups. To fix density, kVp was increased to 115% and mAs was decreased to 50% and after measurements of mean area doses and entrance surface doses were made by each part, each decreased to 58.68% and 59.85% when standard doses were set to 100%, and each increased to 147.28% and 159.9% when kVp was decreased to 85% and mAs was increased to 200%. Comparisons of density changes showed that hand, knee, abdomen, and skull radiography all displayed significance probabilities>0.05, showing no changes in concentration. Radiography that increases kVp and lowers mAs through reasonable calculations within ranges that don’t affect resolution and contrast seems to be a simple way to decrease patient exposure doses.",강은보,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106499001
방사선·알칼리 전처리 볏짚 당화액 및 당밀 활용Desmodesmus sp. KAERI-NJ5의 지질 생산성 비교 평가,"Depending on species, microalgae can produce fatty acids more efficiently byusing organic carbon sources than by using the phototrophic cultivation mode. In this study,Desmodesmus sp. KAERI-NJ5 was grown in heterotrophic (HT) and mixotrophic (MT) modesusing enzymatic hydrolysate of rice straw pretreated with radiation and alkali solution to enhancebiodiesel feedstock productivity. In addition, biomass and lipid productivities were comparedwith the results from molasses based medium. Firstly, carbon source preference of the microalgawas determined. Although the presence of light caused a slight difference in the carbon sourcepreference, glucose was the most preferred carbon source in both types of cultivation. The ricestraw hydrolysate (RSH) was used as a carbon source and successfully utilized by the microalga.
The biomass and lipid yield was higher in the HT cultivation mode than those from the MTcultivation mode. The final biomass and lipid yield of 6.0 and 3.4 g·l-1 was achieved, respectively,in HT cultivation. In addition, the conversion yield of consumed sugars to lipid and fatty acidmethyl esters (FAMEs) were 34.2 and 31.4%, respectively, which is even higher than that grownwith corresponding pure sugars. Analysis of the FAMEs composition revealed that palmitic, oleic,and stearic acids were the main FAMEs, and the FAMEs content was 52.19% in the HT cultivationmode corresponding to a 1.51-fold higher content than with MT cultivation. In addition, 92.52%of FAMEs consisted of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids indicating good qualitybiodiesel feedstock. In addition, the productivities of biomass, total lipid and FAMEs were also evaluated when the microalga was grown with molasses, a representative low-cost carbon source,in both cultivation modes. The highest total lipid yield was 3.9 g·l-1 in the HT cultivation modecorresponding to 1.15-fold higher than that of the RSH grown microalga. However, the lipidproductivity was negligible considering the quality as a biodiesel feedstock, regional availabilityand sustainability of carbon sources. Thus, the RSH could be used as a carbon source for biodieselfeedstock production by Desmodesmus sp. KAERI-NJ5.",조민호,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106385159
유리선량계를 이용한 청신경초종 질환의 2차 발암률에 관한 연구,"This study aims to analyze the secondary carcinogenesis rate caused by exposure of organs at risk of damage using a glass dosimeter during radiosurgery in vestibular schwannoma disease.

다양한 X-ray 촬영조건을 이용하여 획득한 skull 영상에서의 Total Variation 알고리즘의 가능성 연구,"Noise in skull X-ray imaging is inevitable, which reduces imaging quality and diagnostic accuracy and increases errors due to the nature of digital imaging devices. Increasing the dose can attenuate noise, but that could lead to big problems with higher exposure dose received by patients. Thus, noise reduction algorithms are actively being studied at low doses to solve dose problems and reduce noise at the same time. Wiener filter and median filter have been widely used, with the disadvantages of poor noise reduction efficiency and loss of much information about imaging boundary. The purpose of this study is to apply total variation (TV) algorithm to skull X-ray imaging that can compensate for the problems of previous noise reduction efficiency to assess quantitatively and compare them. For this study, skull X-ray imaging is obtained using various kVp and mAs using the skull phantom using the X-ray device of Siemens. In addition, contrast to noise ratio (CNR) and coefficient of variation (COV) are compared and measured when noisy image, median filter, Wiener filter and TV algorithm were applied to each phantom imaging. Experiments showed that when TV algorithms were applied, CNR and COV characteristics were excellent under all conditions. In conclusion, we've been able to see if we can use TV algorithm to improve image quality and CNR could be seen to increase due to the decrease in noise as the amount of increased mAs. On the other hand, COV decreased as the amount of increased mAs, and when kVp increased, noise was reduced and the transmittance was increased, so COV was reduced.",박성우,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106418695
