The most of BIPV modules have the form of GtoG (Glass to Glass) photovoltaic in building applications. Degradation leading to failure in photovoltaic modules is very important factor in BIPV modules. This paper analyzed the performance of various BIPV modules through outdoor exposure tests. Performance of three BIPV modules(c-Si type, a-Si type and DSSC type) with three installation angles influenced by sun light, outdoor temperature, and wind velocity was monitored and analyzed. As a result, c-Si type BIPV module outperforms other BIPV modules(a-Si type). In terms of power efficiency of the module, the installed angle of 45° is better than others(90 degree, 0 degree). In addition, more realistic data of various BIPV system performance could be available through the field test and integrated building test. In this study, relationship of the BIPV system is identified module’s installation angle, power generation, architectural performance, etc.",이상문(Lee Sang-Moon),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101857154
계절별 PV 및 PVT의 효율 비교를 통한 공기식 PVT 시스템의 태양에너지 활용 효과 분석,"Recently, the use of new and renewable energy for suppressing the generation of carbon dioxide to prevent global warming has attracted considerable attention. Among the various new and renewable energy sources, solar energy has been attracting increasing interest for the reduction of building energy, as it is easy to implement in buildings and excellent for maintenance and repair. Therefore, in this study, an air-based photovoltaic thermal (PVT) system, which can increase the utilization of solar energy, was compared with the existing PV system through measurements. The PVT system can increases the amount of power generated by reducing the temperature of the panel via the air passing through the lower part of the panel. Furthermore, useing the air whose temperature has been increased by the heat obtained from the panel for indoor heating or hot water supply in the building is possible. The performance of existing PV and PVT panels was measured under the same weather conditions, and result indicated that the power generation efficiency of PVT panels, through which the air passes was higher than that of PV panels. Furthermore, the air whose temperature was increased to ≥40°C by the PVT system may be utilized for heating and hot water supply. Overall, by utilizing solar power, air-based PVT systems can utilize 3.4 ~ 3.9 times more solar power than can conventional PVs.",김강현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108246157
국내 RE100 이행방안의 경제성 비교분석 연구,"The Global RE100 campaign is a one of the voluntary campaign, but it has a lot of influence on domestic companies that have not yet joined the Global RE100. Accordingly, the Korean government introduced the Korean RE100 (K-RE100) system to prepare an institutional mechanism for domestic companies to respond to RE100. However, in Korea, due to the high LCOE of renewable energy and institutional limitations of the power transaction system, there is a limit for companies to implement RE100 in various ways. Therefore, in this study, the implementation cost of RE100 for green tariff, REC purchase, third-party PPA, direct(or corporate) PPA, and self-generation was compared and analyzed to derive the order of implementation with the net present value (NPV) of costs incurred over 20 years. As a result, self-construction was analyzed as the most economical method, but the implementation through the green tariff seemed to be the most realistic implementation method so far. However, considering the gradually falling LCOE, third-party PPA and direct PPA could be secured competitiveness against green tariff in 2025 and 2026. Then it could allow the companies to have various portfolios for implementation of RE100.",안상효(Sang Hyo An),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108181670
풍속 측정 방법에 따른 풍력발전기 출력성능 비교,"An experimental investigation was carried out to identify the difference between wind turbine power curves derived from hub height wind speed (HHWS) and rotor equivalent wind speed (REWS) at the Haengwon and Dongbok wind farms on Jeju Island. The terrains of the wind farms were analyzed according to International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-12-1 2nd edition. The Haengwon wind farm was analyzed as a simple terrain, while the Dongbok wind farm was analyzed as a complex terrain that needed site calibration before power performance testing. Since the site calibration process for the operating wind farm was not possible, power performance testing was performed without site calibration. The power curves were derived using HHWS and REWS, and the annual energy productions (AEPs) were calculated by applying the Rayleigh wind speed distribution to the power curves. In addition, the normalized revenue by 1 MW for 20 years was calculated using the AEPs. As a result, the average HHWS and REWS at the Haengwon wind farm were 11.68 m/s and 11.64 m/s, while those at the Dongbok wind farm were 8.22 m/s and 8.18 m/s, respectively. The average relative error of the AEP at annual average wind speeds of 5to 11 m/s was 0.96 % for Haengwon wind farm and 1.68 % for the Dongbok wind farm. The average revenue difference at annual average wind speeds of 4 to 11m/s was 55 million Korean won for the Haengwon wind farm and 111 million Korean won for the Dongbok wind farm.",강보신,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107956782
염료감응형 태양전지를 적용한 유리 패널의 효율 향상에 관한 연구,"Dye-sensitized solar cell(DSC) allows light transmission and the application of various colors that make it especially suitable for building-integrated PV (BIPV) application. In order to apply DSC module into windows, it has to be panelized: DSC module should be protected with reinforced glass to the entire surface. Up to date, it seems to be common to make double glazing with DSC modules with air gaps between the glasses and the DSC modules. Few research has been conducted on the characteristics of various glazing types with DSC modules. This study aims to analyze the electrical performance of DSC modules according to panelizing method for glazing unit with DSC modules. The prototype of the DSC glazing that applied silicone filler between DSC modules and glasses was developed. The electrical performances of this type of DSC glazing with the filler and rather conventional double glazing with DSC modules were compared. Their performances were measured using a solar simulator that is suitable for DSC performance testing. The results indicated that the electrical performance of the filler type DSC glazing improved by 7% compared to that of the conventional DSC double glazing type.","장한빈(Jang, Han-Bin)",2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99736719

다세대주택 옥상 PV 연계 가정용 BESS의 에너지 절감 효과 분석,"The discussion about carbon neutrality has recently spread worldwide in response to the climate crisis. In Korea, the concept of zero-energy buildings is one of the means to reduce carbon emissions in the construction sector. Photovoltaic (PV) power systems are the most commonly installed renewable energy systems in residential buildings. However, the installed PV capacity in apartment houses is limited because of difficulty in securing PV installation area and inability to process the surplus PV power. Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are emerging as a means for the storage and reuse of surplus PV power. In this study, the energy-saving effect of a residential BESS connected to a rooftop PV system was analyzed for eight households in a multi-family house. The data of the main load power (grid supply) and PV+BESS power from households collected from August to October 2021 were analyzed. During the operation of the BESS, the surplus PV power was stored in the battery, and the PV+BESS power was continuously supplied to the load by discharging the battery regardless of the PV power time. Based on the average representative data for 6 days, the power saving rate was approximately 26.0% for the rooftop PV system and approximately 41.8% for the BESS.",엄지영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108040354
태양열 발전 기술의 동향과 전망,"Concentrated solar power(CSP) is receiving attention for its ability to generate dispatchable power from heat stored in thermal energy storage(TES). There are currently four types of CSP technology, however experts expect that only parabolic trough and solar tower are to survive from the market due to its higher efficiency and larger capacity in storage. While the initial cost for installing CSP plant is still expensive, the experts expect that investment cost of CSP would decline to the level which would be competitive with PV or wind in the near term future.

재생에너지 출력제약을 고려한 에너지저장장치 운영방안 및 용량 산정,"This paper introduces operation planning and capacity calculation through combining of short-duration and long-duration energy storage systems (ESSs) for reducing curtailment. Because curtailment is related to time, a photovoltaic (PV) output occurs, short-duration ESS has a limitation for reducing curtailment; and capacity of long-duration ESS can be overestimated. We show a combination of short-duration battery energy storage system (BESS) and long-duration pumped storage hydro (PSH) to reduce curtailment as minimizing capacity. A combination of BESS and PSH is applied to small-scale grids with a high penetration of variable renewable energy. To find the effect of an input order of two types of ESSs, several case studies are conducted, and results are compared when the short-duration and long-duration of ESS are combined. If PSH is put in first, curtailment can be further reduced with less capacity.",김영민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108571263
