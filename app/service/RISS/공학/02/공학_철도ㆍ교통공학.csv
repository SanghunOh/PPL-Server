항공사의 연합패키지 상품 활성화 방안에 관한 연구,"The purpose of this study is how can maximize the market of consolidation package in europe bound. Recently, European carrier introduced new type of package, consolidation package which is contributed to boost up benefit cost on airlines. Consolidation package is wide spread to all airlines in korea the reason why korean travel market is unstable according to seasonality. Therefore airlines are trying to avoid low yield of off season and achieve their target.
In order to raise up to the foundation stone in travel package market, Airlines have to develope many kinds of consolidation package. Consolidation package can break off seasonality and economical crisis in airline industry.
Airlines consolidation package should be enforced to manage package travel agents with proper way as like familiarization tour and be invested to develope new competitive products.
Airlines and travel agents are unable to divide in tourism industry, Both have to co-operate and pursuit bilateral win-win strategy. That will be followed development of tourism industry.",홍규선,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30039280
정책갈등프레임워크(PCF)를 활용한 신공항 입지갈등 분석 : 제주 제2공항 사례를 중심으로,"This study analyze the location conflict of the second Jeju airport, which has based on Policy Conflict Framework(PCF). The PCF consists of 3 components ; an episode of policy conflict, policy settings and feedback. A conceptual definition of an episode of policy conflict distinguishes between cognitive and behavioral characteristics. A policy settiing is organized into 4 conceptual categories ; different 3 levels of action where conflicts may emerge, policy actor attributes, events, and the policy issues. Feedback is produced by the outputs and outcomes of policy conflicts.
This research investigates the characteristics of new airport's position conflict and their policy settings, and draw policy implications. As the result of analysis, position conflict of the second Jeju airport shows a high intensity conflict which has the extremely different policy positions between actors, great threats from them, and thus strong unwillingness to compromise. Before positioning, local governments strive for attracting airport infrastructure, but after positioning, neighboring residents are against for it and strongly conflict with the central government. Factors which influence on the position conflict of new airport are political election events and the distrust about information related to the policy of the government.",조홍남,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106262799

노선버스 대체형 DRT 운행에 대한 이용자 의식분석,"Population reduction and aging are progressing rapidly in the outskirts of local cities as the social movement of the population is concentrated in urban areas with relatively high levels of living SOC and jobs. With the decrease in population in the suburbs, while the demand for public transportation is gradually decreasing, it is expected that the financial burden on the local government for maintaining the existing bus system will increase. Governments and local governments are promoting the introduction of Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) to reduce the burden of financial support for buses while improving the transportation facilities for people in vulnerable areas in public transport services. Changwon City continues to increase funding for maintaining bus services operating in urban suburbs, and it is time to introduce DRTs for Replacement of bus service. In this study, for bus users in 39 villages in Changwon City’s route bus sparsely operated area, we derived factors favoring DRT for replacement of bus services. And, based on the theory of resistance of innovation, we investigated the factors of resistance to innovation in groups that did not adopt DRT. In this way, we tried to present the appropriate operation direction at the time of introducing the DRT for replacement of bus services in vulnerable areas in public transport services in Changwon City. The results of the research are expected to be used as policy data for the successful introduction of DRT for the reduction of the local government’s bus financial burden.",박기준,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106489596
국내 물류산업 디지털 기술과 스마트화 수준 진단 연구,"In order to overcome the economic crisis by proposing a ‘transition to the digital economy’ through the ‘Korean New Deal’ policy, the government is promoting a major transformation into a smart logistics system through digitalization of the logistics industry, which has been selected as a promising non-contact service industry. Therefore, this study analyzes the digital technology of the domestic logistics industry and the digital capabilities of logistics companies from various angles, diagnoses the current level and problems to achieve digitalization of the logistics industry, and presents policy implications for government policy and corporate digitalization. First, the technology level of the domestic logistics industry was evaluated through patent analysis of block chain, big data, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud technology, and the level of smartization by logistics industry was compared and analyzed through a survey on logistics companies. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the quality level of digital technology in the domestic logistics sector is relatively low, and technology investment is biased toward specific technologies (blockchain, Internet of Things). The level of smartization of domestic logistics companies was found to be low (2.84 out of a 5-point scale) in the industry as a whole, and it was found that the level of digital transformation and information connection was lower than the level of unmanned and automation. In particular, it is analyzed that the smaller the company, the lower the level of smartization, and it is judged that the industrial structure and smallness centered on manpower are acting as obstacles to smartization technology development and investment. Therefore, it is judged that the government's strong smart logistics transition policy, technology development, and efforts to change the perception of logistics company managers are necessary.",신민성,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108081000
관광산업의 발전방안 연구,"Along with info-communication and environment industry, the Tourist industry is being classified with future high-technology industry. However, in the edge of this special situation caused by the world economy recession, it is indispensible that Korea modify not a little part of its tourist policy.
Our nation's tourist industry made its start as a consequence of the government's enacting the Tourist Promotion Law in 1961, after that, in 1975, the government designated the industry to the nation's strategic industry and exploited the tourist sites and increased the tourist facilities. Fully supported by government, the tourist industry had the eye-opening progress. And the two big world festivals, Asian Game in 1986 and Seoul Olympic Game in 1988, made the nation's tourist industry progress very rapid.
But the continued progression of the industry turned its black to red in the beginning of the 1991, what makes it worse, that red figures is more and more expanding its range.
After Olympic Game, according to the export boom of manufacturing industry and the policy reinforcing the nation's discipline, the tourist industry was judged as the luxury-tendency industry and faced with the stiff capital decrease. To the matter of worse, with all-out opening the trip overseas in 1989, people's reckless trip overseas more depended the disparity between black and red. Added to that, recent economic crisis(IMF) in 1997 and nation's economic deterioration caused by the worldwide recession have the serious effects on the tourist industry.
So, in this study, I will analyze the reality of the tourist business, at present, the basic root of the nation's tourist industry, and diagnose it. In conclusion I hope to find the sound direction of the nation's tourist business.",박종호,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30001330
수도권 버스요금인상에 따른 지하철 운송기관 수입금 변화분석,"Seoul metropolitan area has adopted an integrated transfer and distance-based fare system that allows transfer discounts between different modes of travel. Given that the revenue allocation in the context of the integrated transit system is based on the revenues proportional to the basic fare, an increase in the basic fare of a certain mode is closely linked to the revenue allocation. A rise in the basic fare of a certain mode has caused a collective increase in the allocation of revenues derived from a transit mode with a fixed base fare. A reduction of that fare, on the other hand, has driven down the revenue allocation. Under the circumstance, the lack of a systematic approach to analyze the public transport revenue has made the transport planning authorities nothing but passively respond to the current pricing policy. In other words, a need has arisen to address the limitations of the current methodology of analyzing the transport card data. This paper aimed to analyze the effects of a fare increase of a transport mode on the revenue sensitivity of the other modes. To that end, this paper developed a methodology to calculate costs and revenues based on the order in which transfers were made between different transport modes using the transport card data. In terms of the use of inter-urban metropolitan bus services, this study simulated the effects of the basic bus fares that rose by 100KRW to 600KRW on the revenue from subway fares. The results indicated a reduction of the basic fare distribution ratio due to the decrease in the subway revenue when the base fares for buses increased by 100KRW. This was also evident when the paper reviewed that the Seoul Metro which accounted for 88.1% of the total revenue reduction and experienced a decrease of 7.7million KRW (approx. 2.8billion KRW/year). When fares were increased by 200KRW or more, the increase in the basic fares exceeded the basic fare distribution ratio, which, in contrast, caused a decrease of up to 500KRW for some of the other private train operators. The methodology evaluated in this study may be applied to the policy support systems related to the integrated distance-based pricing scheme in metropolitan areas using the transport card data in the years to come.",신성일,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106489599
도심 항공 모빌리티(UAM) 및 드론시스템용 리튬이온 배터리팩의 화재예방 및 초기 대응기술 검토,"Recently, the domestic railway industry is developing an 'unmanned automation system for safety inspection of railway facilities' that automatically checks the condition of railway facilities with drones and artificial intelligence (AI) technology; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport plans to utilize UAM (Urban Air Mobility), an eco-friendly, low-noise, three-dimensional transportation method, by introducing it to existing transportation methods between airports and train stations with the goal of commercialization in 2025. The power source of these drone systems is mostly lithiumion batteries, but due to the chemical properties of lithium, there is a risk of fire (thermal runaway) depending on the use environment and external factors. This paper summarizes in detail the fire prevention and early response technologies for lithium-ion batteries and verifies their feasibility when installed in actual drone systems. In particular, the weight and volume changes of the battery pack were analyzed when the appropriate fire prevention and early response technologies were selected and applied according to the maximum takeoff weight of the drone.",김범준,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108650412

문화관광의 개념적 범위에 관한 고찰,"The characteristic of cultural tourism has been changed since the seventeenth century based on relationship between tourism and culture. The origin of cultural tourism is usually attributed the Grand Tour, which originated in Britain in the seventeenth century. Most of the early Grand Tourist were aristocrats for whom a trip to continental Europe was often a coda to classical education. During Romanticism, the pattern of Grand tour changed form the ""Classical Grand Tour"" which concentrated on the culture of the ancient classical world and Renaissance, to the ""Romantic Grand Tour,"" with more attention devoted to romantic views of urban and rural scenery. In the aftermath, cultural motive of tourism continued to be heritage tourism focused on museums, monuments, historical sits and so on.
Cultural tourism can be explained as a consequence of wider social and economic trends which mark either the period of `late modernism' or `postmodernism.' Important elements of these trends which relate to the development of cultural tourism include de-differentiation between perviously separate social and economic spheres, antiauratic phenomenon between high culture and popular culture. An important consequence of these changes is that tourism and culture are to be the same sphere.",한숙영,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45031083
대중교통 접근성 분석에 있어서 가변적 공간단위 문제,"This study aims to examine the effect of MAUP in relation to a spatial unit in transit accessibility analysis by example of Chuncheon city and verify the applicability of detailed living zone by comparing with traffic analysis zone based on administrative unit and grid-based spatial unit as alternative. As an example of Chuncheon City, the results of transit accessibility analysis on the three spatial units are as follows. First, in general, detailed living zone that takes into account local characteristics such as population distribution and public transportation infrastructure well reflect the transit accessibility of the study area. Second, the correlation analysis with population density confirms that the public transportation condition could be analyzed differently depending on a spatial unit. Third, the relationship between the aggregation level and the statistics derived from this study was generally well followed by that of the literature, but also represented the variable-specific characteristic of the MAUP effects. This study is meaningful in proposing not only the appropriate spatial unit for the transit accessibility analysis through comparative analysis of the different spatial units for the study area but also in suggesting theoretical background and statistical verification methods in selecting a spatial unit in future relevant studies. Further research is intended to verify the extensibility of the detailed living zone in transit accessibility analysis by applying various indicators other than walking accessibility and transit service area to diverse regions, such as large cities, small cities, and rural areas.",조성진,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106489600

호텔레스토랑의 관계혜택이 고객 충성도에 미치는 영향,"This paper focused on the relationship between relational benefit as perceived by hotel F&B customers and their 'satisfaction and trust to hotel restaurant and hotel employee', and between that same benefit and their loyalty. We also examined the relationship between satisfaction and trust and between trust and loyalty. We placed the accent on a joint analysis of these relationships, using a structural equation model. The results of the empirical study showed that relational benefit was a direct antecedent of 'satisfaction to hotel restaurant and hotel employee' and 'trust to hotel employee' and customer loyalty. The role of relational benefit as a key factor in hotel F&B marketing was thus confirmed. With reference to the other relationship, on the one hand, it was confirmed that 'satisfaction to hotel employee' had a positive influence on 'satisfaction to hotel restaurant' and 'trust to hotel employee' and that 'satisfaction to hotel restaurant' determined 'trust to hotel restaurant'. Also it was confirmed that 'trust to hotel employee' had an important effect in 'trust to hotel restaurant' and that 'trust to hotel restaurant' affected customers' loyalty. However, the influence of relational benefit on 'trust to hotel restaurant' and influence of 'trust to hotel employee' to customers' loyalty cannot be corroborated.

자율주행차에 대한 윤리적 평가와 수용:충돌 대응 알고리즘과 자동차 용도의 영향,"A wider adoption of automated vehicles (AVs) has been facing challenges due to ethical issues involving AVs, such as collision algorithms and public perception of the ethical aspects of AVs. Furthermore, little academic research has investigated whether the types of AVs can affect one’s attitudes toward the AVs. By implementing an online experiment, the current study examined the effects of collision algorithms (selfish/utilitarian) and the type of AVs (taxis/private vehicles) on individuals’ ethical evaluation of the AVs. Also, the current study explored the relationship between ethical evaluation and personal acceptance of AVs, including individuals’ intention to use the AVs and their willingness to pay more for the vehicles. According to the results, there was a discrepancy between what individuals considered ethically desirable and what they would use or pay a premium for. Selfish collision algorithms degraded the ethical evaluation of the AVs in which the algorithms were embedded but increased one’s intention to use or pay more for the AVs. Also, autonomous taxis were found to decrease individuals’ willingness to pay a premium. Furthermore, ethical evaluation was positively associated with intention to use the AVs and willingness to pay more, even after controlling for the influence of the collision algorithms and the type of AVs.

자율주행차 사고 시 보상책임에 대한 인식- 사고에 대한 통제 소재를 중심으로 -,"Collisions of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are different from those of traditional vehicles with respect to the responsibility of drivers since autonomous driving systems take over the control of the vehicles. However, the current law system does not allow distributing liability of collisions to manufacturers, and liability of collisions lies only with AV users. As this liability system is not consistent with public perception, the Korean government has launched the Autonomous Vehicle Accident Investigation Committee. In this context, it is useful to examine how ordinary people perceive liability for autonomous vehicle accidents. This study aims to provide an understanding of how individuals perceive liability regarding collisions of AVs. By conducting an online experiment, this study investigated how vehicle types (AVs vs. traditional vehicles) and the locus of control (internal locus vs. external locus) affect individuals& perceived liability of a collision. After randomly assigned to one of the four experimental conditions, participants in the experiment read a scenario where either an AV or a traditional car was engaged in a collision. The collision was attributed to either the AV or the driver (internal locus) or to external circumstances (external locus). Then, participants completed a questionnaire to present their perceptions regarding the extent of liability held by the driver, the car manufacturer, and the government. According to the results, drivers of traditional vehicles were perceived to be more liable than drivers of AVs. Especially, when an AV caused a collision due to its own fault (internal locus), the driver&s liability decreased to a greater degree. Furthermore, the liability of the car manufacturer or the government was perceived to be higher when the collision involved an AV than when the collision concerned a traditional vehicle. Particularly, the perceived liability of the manufacturer increased to a greater degree when the collision was caused by an AV at fault. However, the perceived liability of the government did not increase even if an AV is responsible for the collision. The present study expands upon previous research on responsibility attribution regarding collisions of AVs, providing empirical data that individuals perceive and assign liability differently to AV collisions compared to collisions involving traditional vehicles. These findings hold practical implications for legislation concerning AVs.",주연경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108641165
