The mass use of plastic started in the 1950s and has exponentially increased ever since. Today, the world produces more than 350 million tons of plastic every year. However, of the 8.3 billion metric tons that have been produced, only nine percent have been recycled. The pandemic accelerates the use of single-use plastics for packaging and food delivery, which is intensifying our plastic waste problem.

초고온가스로 연계 블루수소 생산 공정의 열역학적 분석,"As the impacts of global climate change become increasingly apparent, the reduction of carbon emissions has emerged as a critical subject of discussion. Nuclear power has garnered attention as a potential carbon-free energy source; however, the rapidity of load following in nuclear power generation poses challenges in comparison to fossil-fueled methods. Consequently, power- to-gas systems, which integrate nuclear power and hydrogen, have attracted growing interest. This study presents a preliminary design of a very high temperature reactor (VHTR) integrated blue hydrogen production process utilizing DWSIM, an open-source process simulator. The blue hydrogen production process is estimated to supply the necessary calorific value for carbon capture through tail gas combustion heat.

In other words, I will analyze the privacy and bathroom culture in the flat unit, and the spatial connectivity of the corridor, along with the differences in residential culture, and consider and analyze it from a spatial perspective. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the bathroom space, which originated from the unique bathing culture related to privacy, is mainly arranged near the entrance with the distinction between dry and wet spaces, and the traditional tatami mat is applied as a basic module to the present residential space. . In addition, the privacy of the family unit is divided into a separate door in the corridor, so that the living room and kitchen space are located independently. Through quantitative analysis, the ratio of bathroom space to the total area is kept constant, indicating that Japanese preferences and demands for bathroom space are superior to other spaces.

팽창흑연 복합소재를 이용한 리튬 배터리의 화재 및 열 폭주 억제 기술에 관한 연구,"In the rapidly growing electric vehicle battery market, the fire hazard caused by thermal runaway is an essential problem that needs to be solved. To prevent thermal runaway, many studies are being conducted, such as the development of effective thermal management systems, stabilization of electrolytes, use of new materials and designs for more stable battery manufacturing, and reduction of battery defects through manufacturing process improvements. Expanded graphite can withstand high temperatures, so it is widely used as a non-combustible material and a non-combustible coating compound. Composites prepared using expanded graphite form a thick air layer by the expanded graphite during a fire. As this air layer blocks high-temperature radiant heat generated by the fire, it can be applied as a non-combustible material or a fire and heat resistant material. In this study, a composite material consisting of expanded graphite was manufactured, and experiments were conducted to investigate its effectiveness in suppressing fires and thermal runaway in lithium batteries, utilizing the thermal physical properties of expanded graphite. We verified that this material can be a viable alternative for effectively blocking heat and preventing large-scale fires caused by heat transfer to adjacent batteries and continuous explosions.",임석대(Suk-Dae Lim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108668249
NCM811 리튬이온 배터리의 크기에 따른 에너지 밀도 및 열폭주 현상에 대한 수치해석적 분석,"In this study, the energy density and thermal runaway phenomenon of the NCM811 lithium-ion battery according to the 21700/46800 two sizes were analyzed numerically. The 46800 battery cell had a five times higher energy density than the 21700 battery cell, and when placed on the same battery platform, the total energy capacity was approximately 88,800 Wh and the energy density averaged 315 Wh/kg, which is approximately the energy capacity of the 21700 battery pack. 18.3%, the energy density is predicted to be about doubling. If the weight of the 46800 battery cell is reduced and the efficiency of the cell to pack technology that composes the pack without a module is improved, the energy density will be higher. As a result of analyzing the thermal runaway phenomenon of the 21700/46800 battery cells with a 2D model, the 46800 battery cells showed a thermal runaway phenomenon about 853 seconds later compared to the 21700 battery cells at an external temperature of 150℃.

CNT 함량에 따른 CNT/Epoxy 복합재료 제작 및 모드 1 파괴 인성 평가,"In order to save the energy in vehicles using renewable energy, it is necessary to reduce the weight of parts with polymer matrix composites. Carbon nanotube (CNT) is the nano-scale reinforcement used to increase the interlaminar strength of fiber reinforced composites or enhance the fracture toughness of polymer. However, since the degree of improvement in mechanical properties varies according to the various experimental conditions such as shape of reinforcement, types of matrix and dispersion of reinforcement, research to find the optimal conditions is essentially needed. In this study, CNT/epoxy composites with different CNT concentration were fabricated under the same conditions, and the optimal CNT content (2 wt%) was found through Mode 1 fracture toughness test. Furthermore, through optical microscopy, it was confirmed that the fracture toughness was rather decreased due to the CNT aggregation when the CNT content exceeded 2 wt%.",권동준,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107283367

서울시민의 소음공해 인식에 대한 연구,"Noise pollution, especially road traffic noise-in terms of population exposure-has become a major problem in Seoul. However, although noise can be sensed directly, it is considered somewhat less important compared to other environmental pollutions. In this study, we chose nine districts in Seoul and distributed a questionnaire containing 23 questions in related to the awareness of noise pollution for 950 people living in Seoul. The results were analyzed according to the citizens' awareness on the whole, age, occupation, and were compared to the actual noise level measured by the Seoul Metropolitan Government. The analysis of the questionnarie show that road traffic noise is considered to be the main source of noise pollution in Seoul. People think that the individual and the Seoul Metropolitan Government are most responsible for the noise reduction in Seoul, but replies only little effort is put into when asked whether one has made any personal effort to reduce noise. We have concluded that noise pollution is not considered a hazardous problem to most Seoul citizens, and that most of them seem to be used to it.

Accordingly, familiarity, risk perception, and acceptability of psychological factors were investigated. In addition, this study identified whether there are differences in psychological factors according to the general characteristics of gender, age, occupation, and housing type. The results showed that awareness of hydrogen cars and fuels is below the average level, and we also have obtained the implication that social knowledge sharing should precede the implementation of hydrogen policy.

The effect of Ar shielding gas and heat input on the mechanical properties and formability was investigated using Vickers hardness, transverse-weld tensile and bulge test. Porosity on the weld beads and sections and hot crack on the fracture surfaces of transverse-weld tensile test specimens were investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopy.

This study focused on differentcharacteristics in accordance with relative deposition directions of PBF and DED during hybrid AM production. Characteristics of the sample fabricated by hybrid AM (i.e., hybrid sample) were compared with those of the samplefabricated by PBF or DED. Ferrite was dominant in the microstructure of PBF deposits with very fine retained austenite observed locally. In contrast, lath martensite and retained austenite were formed uniformly in the microstructure of DED deposits. Different microstructures in the two processes were attributed to differences of cooling rate. In DED deposits, microhardness was significantly decreased owing to a high retained austenite fraction. However, in the hybrid sample, microhardness was rapidly increased in the HAZ owing to aging heat treatment for long-term deposition.
