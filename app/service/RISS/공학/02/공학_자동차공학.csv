The difference on the relationship between the binocular balance test and the average spherical diopters by the corrective visual acuity in myopia was statistically significant(p <0.05).",±èÁ¤Èñ,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A323197
Steer-by-Wire System Àû¿ëÀ» À§ÇÑ Steering Wheel Simulator System¿¡ °üÇÑ ¿¬±¸,"Steer-By- Wire is the one of the advanced technologies that will be applied to steering system for the next generation's vehicles. It removes mechanical linkages between steering wheel and front wheels. As a result, SBW enhances the safety of car crash and simplifies vehicle design process.
The main purpose of this study is to focus on steering wheel simulation system for Steer-By-Wire. The SBW system consists of two important parts. One of them is steering wheel control, which generates steering reactive torque, and uses handwheel feedback motor to transfer information of road to a driver.
In addition, a control algorithm is developed for a driver to adjust the steering feel, as if hydraulic steering system conveys. The algorithm uses full vehicle model designed by a steering model from Matlab/Simulink model.",±èÀÏÈ¯(Ilhwan Kim),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76319863
