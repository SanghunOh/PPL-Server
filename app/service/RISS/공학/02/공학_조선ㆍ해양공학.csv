Hysys를 이용한 50㎾급 선박 배기폐열회수시스템 설계,"In plant, power generation has recently become popular, especially when the utility cost becomes high. However, conventional electricity generation is not always economically feasible for private industry due to its capital cost and source of high priced fuels. An important number of new solutions have been proposed to generate electricity from low and medium heat source. Among the proposed solutions, the Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC) system using a organic working fluid is most widely used. Waste Heat Recovery System(WHRS) is energy conversion technology that recovery the thermal energy of ship's exhaust gas and generate electric energy. The purpose of this study is to design the 50㎾-class electric generating system applied to WHRS for ship and to acquire the thermal design data for the heat cycle system using ASPEN HYSYS program.

빅데이터 기법을 활용한 항해 중 준해양사고 발생원인 분석에 관한 연구,"Various studies have been conducted to reduce marine accidents. However, research on marine incidents is only marginal. There are many reports of marine incidents, but the main content of existing studies has been qualitative, which makes quantitative analysis difficult. However, quantitative analysis of marine accidents is necessary to reduce marine incidents. The purpose of this paper is to analyze marine incident data quantitatively by applying big data techniques to predict marine incident trends and reduce marine accident. To accomplish this, about 10,000 marine incident reports were prepared in a unified format through pre-processing. Using this preprocessed data, we first derived major keywords for the Marine incidents at sea using text mining techniques. Secondly, time series and cluster analysis were applied to major keywords. Trends for possible marine incidents were predicted. The results confirmed that it is possible to use quantified data and statistical analysis to address this topic. Also, we have confirmed that it is possible to provide information on preventive measures by grasping objective tendencies for marine incidents that may occur in the future through big data techniques.",강석용,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430297
인공지능 기반 선체 균열 탐지 현장 적용성 연구,"With the advent of autonomous ships, it is emerging as one of the very important issues not only to operate with a minimum crew or unmanned ships, but also to secure the safety of ships to prevent marine accidents. On-site inspection of the hull is mainly performed by the inspector's visual inspection, and video information is recorded using a small camera if necessary. However, due to the shortage of inspection personnel, time and space constraints, and the pandemic situation, the necessity of introducing an automated inspection system using artificial intelligence and remote inspection is becoming more important. Furthermore, research on hardware and software that enables the automated inspection system to operate normally even under the harsh environmental conditions of a ship is absolutely necessary. For automated inspection systems, it is important to review artificial intelligence technologies and equipment that can perform a variety of hull failure detection and classification. To address this, it is important to classify the hull failure. Based on various guidelines and expert opinions, we divided them into 6 types(Crack, Corrosion, Pitting, Deformation, Indent, Others). It was decided to apply object detection technology to cracks of hull failure. After that, YOLOv5 was decided as an artificial intelligence model suitable for survey and a common hull crack dataset was trained. Based on the performance results, it aims to present the possibility of applying artificial intelligence in the field by determining and testing the equipment required for survey.",송상호,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108226751
시스템다이내믹스를 이용한 낚시어선의 단속과 처벌에 따른 동태적 매커니즘 분석,"In this paper, system dynamics considering dynamics and time was examined to study the changes in system structure according to reinforcement (policy intervention) of regulation and punishment for fishing boats, and the strategizing directions were analyzed . Until now, regulations and punishments on fishing boats have been conducted temporarily and short-term as a precautionary measure to prevent accidents and imposed penalties. However, due to various anomalous side effects, the expected results were not achieved, negligent accidents occurred constantly, and follow-up measures were repeated. Resultantly, the regulation and punishment of fishing boats is a reinforced safety standard, and there is a necessity to improve facilities, equipment, and industry, and develop technology (including time delay) to prevent accidents. However, as the negative (illegal) activities continue without immediate and significant resistance, the safety blind spot for accident prevention cannot be minimized. Thus, policy intervention based on linear thinking without sufficiently considering variables of the dynamic mechanism and time can distort the basic values pursued by the policy. For the regulation and punishment of fishing boats, a strategy to supplement the mechanism should be prepared prior to the preparation of reinforced safety standards.

선박용 로터세일 주위의 난류 유동특성에 관한 수치해석적 연구,"As environmental regulations such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s strategy to reduce greenhouse gases(GHG) are strengthened, technology development such as eco-friendly ships and alternative fuels is expanding. As part of this, ship propulsion technology using energy reduction and wind propulsion technology is emerging, especially in shipping companies and shipbuilders. By securing wind propulsion technology and introducing empirical research into shipbuilding and shipping, a high value-added market using eco-friendly technology can be created. Moreover, by reducing the fuel consumption rate of operating ships, GHG can be reduced by 6-8%. Rotor Sail (RS) technology is to generate a hydrodynamic lift in the vertical direction of the cylinder when the circular cylinder rotates at a constant speed and passes through the fluid. This is called the Magnus effect, and this study attempted to propose a plan to increase propulsion efficiency through a numerical analysis study on turbulence flow characteristics around RS, a wind power assistance propulsion system installed on a ship. Therefore, and values according to SR and AR changes were derived as parameters that affect the aerodynamic force of the RS, and the flow characteristics around the rotor sail were compared according to EP application.",김정은,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108186340

어선전복경보시스템 알고리즘 검증을 위한 어선 횡동요 시험 및 시간영역 횡동요 시뮬레이션,"This study contributes to deepening understand of the characteristics of fishing vessel rolling motions to improve the development of capsizing alarm systems. A time domain rolling motion simulation was performed. In order to verify capsizing alarm systems, it is necessary to carry out experiments assuming a capsizing situation and perform actual fishing vessel measurements, but these tasks are impossible due to the danger of such a situation. However, in many capsizing accidents, a close connection with rolling motion was found. Accordingly, the rolling motion of a fishing boat, which is the core of a fishing vessel capsizing alarm system, has been accurately measured and a time domain based on a rolling motion simulation has been performed. This information was used to verify the algorithm for a capsizing alarm system. Firstly, the characteristics of rolling motion were measured through a motion experiment. For small vessels such as fishing vessels, it was difficult to interpret viscosity due to analytical methods including CFD and potential codes. Therefore, an experiment was carried out focusing on rolling motion and a rolling mode RAO was derived.",양영준,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104799961
항법상 속력의 제한규칙에 관한 고찰 - VTS의 관제 관점에서 -,"Every vessel shall proceed at a safe speed to avoid collision. Additionally, every vessel shall comply with the speed limit rules in the territorial water and internal waters of Korea. The VTS operator shall properly control the compliance of the vessel with the safe speed and speed limit rules. Safe speed under the COLREG 1972 is not explicitly stipulated in knots. However, under the Domestic law for traffic safety-specific sea areas, etc., the speed limit is specified in knots and complied with. This speed limit rule is mainly based on the ‘speed made good over the ground’; however, in some places, it is based on the ‘speed making way through the water’. In this paper, I analyzed marine accidents that occurred in the past 5 years and the rate of violation of speed limits. Furthermore, I reviewed safe speed under the COLREG 1972, speed limit rules under domestic and foreign laws, and cases of non-compliance with safe speed in the judgment of the Korea Maritime Safety Tribunal. Resultantly, I suggested in this paper that the speed limit rules in the domestic law must be observed by vessels to prevent marine accidents, and the rules which are stipulated in terms of ‘speed making way through the water’ must be revised as ‘speed made good over the ground’ such that the vessels can easily comply with them and the VTS operator can control the vessel properly.",정대율,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108118490

문섬 등 주변해역 생태계보호구역 내 산호군락지의 보전가치,"The Korean government has been trying to conserve a marine ecosystem that has been shifting due to climate change. As part of this effort, the government designated seventy-seven marine species that have been disappearing and deserve to be protected as endangered managing them specially. To generate basic data to guide policy for these endangered species, their value must be measured. OOf the species declared endangered, coral is particularly threatened by climate change, and its management is important. Accordingly, understanding the potential value of reefs, can be an effective way of proving the benefits of continuous management to decision makers and the general public alike. To this end, we have applied the contingent valuation method (CVM), an economic technique of for valuing a environmental and non-market goods such as a coral reef. A national face-to-face survey of 1,000 randomly selected households was conducted in order to determine the public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for conserving coral reefs. A one-and-one-half-bound (OOHB) model was adopted to interpret WTP responses, and a spike model was employed to deal with zero WTP responses. The results show that the conservation value of a coral reef can be estimated at 3,016 won per household per year, statistically significant at the 1% level. Expanding values to the national population gives an annual value of 58.9 billion won. We can conclude that the public is willing to pay a significant amount to conserve coral reefs.",박소연,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105151938
중국의 멸종위기종 보호법에 대한 검토와 개선책,"The purpose of this study is to analyze endangered species laws and systems in China from the viewpoint of the importance of protecting biodiversity and to propose suggestions for existing wildlife protection laws in China to improve efficacy. Since the People's Republic of China Wildlife Protection Act was promulgated and enforced in 1988, China has found that urgent amendments are necessary because of neglected management of the act. The content of the Wildlife Protection Act of China is not only monotonous and unsystematic, but also needs modification and supplementation because it is pre-modern and does not meet current demands. In comparison with other countries, the purpose of China’s legislation, supervision system, scope of protection and public participation system differ. China’s Wildlife Protection Act is also hindered by confusion in the legislative protection system, lack of an administrative compensation system, difficulties in implementation, deterioration of legal efficiency, lack of content and operations, and lack of a list of species that should be is protected.

신장률 변화에 따른 초탄성 재료의 비선형 재료모델 비교 연구,"Recently, the application of non-steel materials in ships and offshore plants is increasing because of the development of various nonlinear materials and the improvement of performance. Especially, hyper-elastic materials, which have a nonlinear stress-strain relationship, are used mainly in marine plant structures or ships where impact relaxation, vibration suppression, and elasticity are required, while elasticity must be maintained, even under high strain conditions. In order to simulate and evaluate the behavior of the hyperelastic material, it is very important to select an appropriate material model according to the strain of the material. This study focused on the selection of material models for hyperelastic materials, such as rubber used in the marine and offshore fields. Tension and compression tests and finite element simulations were conducted to compare the accuracy of the nonlinear material models due to variations in the stretch ratio of hyper-elastic material. Material coefficients of nonlinear material models are determined based on the curve fitting of experimental data.

실습선원의 인권침해 개선에 관한 연구,"All people have human rights that should be protected, and today, the importance of protecting human rights is emphasized in all areas of society. The industry is also carrying out activities to protect the human rights of workers, such as implementing human rights education for human rights management and preparing a response system for human rights violations. However, due to the closed environment and special working conditions, seafarers on board are often placed in a blind spot in human rights protection. In particular, a number of cases of human rights violations concerning beginner seafarers, including cadets, have been identified, and relevant research is insufficient compared to other occupational groups. Jobs that restrict basic human rights cannot be envied by anyone. In this study, implications and problems were derived based on the results of a human rights survey of cadets, and cases of human rights violations, and improvement measures were proposed. The cadets had a very negative perception of human rights violations before boarding. However, it was found that their perception changed after boarding. It was confirmed that cadets have unnecessary fears and concerns before boarding.

하계 마리안 소만 빙하후퇴에 따른 식물플랑크톤 변동성 분석,"Rapid climate change has resulted in glacial retreat and increased meltwater inputs in the Antarctic Peninsula, including King George Island where Marian Cove is located. Consequently, these phenomena are expected to induce changes in the water column light properties, which in turn will affect phytoplankton communities. To comprehend the effects of glacial retreat on the marine ecosystem in Marian Cove, we investigated on phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll-a, chl-a) and various environment parameters in this area in December 2021 and January 2022. The average temperature at the euphotic depth in January 2022 (1.41 ± 0.13 ℃) was higher than that in December 2021 (0.87 ± 0.17 ℃). Contrastingly, the average salinity was lower in January 2022 (33.9 ± 0.10 psu) than in December 2021 (34.1 ± 0.12 psu). Major nutrients, including dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and silicate, were sufficiently high, and thus, did not act as limiting factors for phytoplankton biomass. In December 2021 and January 2022, the mean chl-a concentrations were 1.03 ± 0.64 and 0.66 ± 0.15μg L-1, respectively. The mean concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) was 24.9 ± 3.54 mg L-1 during the study period, with elevated values observed in the vicinity of the inner glacier. However, relative lower chl-a concentrations were observed near the inner glacier, possibly due to high SPM load from the glacier, resulting in reduced light attenuation by SPM shading. Furthermore, the proportion of nanophytoplankton exceeded 70% in the inner cove, contributing to elevated mean fractions of nanophytoplankton in the glacier retreat marine ecosystem. Overall, our study indicated that freshwater and SPM inputs from glacial meltwater may possibly act as main factors controlling the dynamics of phytoplankton communities in glacier retreat areas. The findings may also serve as fundamental data for better understanding the carbon cycle in Marian Cove.",심초롬,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108737100

Drawing development, approvals and temporary survey of the ship were performed for the installation of the after-treatment system. For performance evaluation, the gaseous emission analyzer was used according to the NOx technical code and ISO-8178 method of measurement. The particulate matter analyzer used a smoke meter to measure black carbon, as discussed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Tests were conducted using MGO (0.043%) and LSFO (0.42%) fuels according to the sulfur content. The test conditions were selected by considering the engine rpm (130, 160 and 180). Gaseous emission and particulate matter (smoke) were measured according to the test conditions to confirm the reduction efficiency of the after treatment system. The results of NOx emission and particulate matter (smoke) revealed that reduction efficiency was more than 90%. The exhaust pressure met the allowable back pressure (less than 50 mbar).

제주 남부해역 조하대 하계 해조군집 및 갯녹음 특성,"This study was conducted to investigate marine algal community characteristics and the status of barren ground in the summer at study sites on Jeju Island, Korea. Sampling was carried out from July to September 2017 using a qualitative and quantitative survey (including coverage of non-geniculated coralline algae and density of grazer) by scuba diving. A total of 121 species were identified, including 11 (9.1%) green algae, 24 (19.8%) brown algae, and 86 (71.1%) red algae. Hyeongjeseom had the greatest diversity, with 60 species, and Harye the least, with 18 species. The mean biomass at the study sites was 1,503.0 g·m-2, while the mean for the neighboring islets (3,268.7 g·m-2) was higher than that of the main island (914.7 g·m-2). Also, dominant species was identified: Sargassum macrocarpum at the neighboring islets, and Ecklonia cava at the main island, with differences showing not only in biomass but also species composition. In conclusion, the marine algal community status in summer at the study sites was evaluated based on the algal community characteristics (species composition, biomass, biomass ratio of kelp species), coverage of non-geniculated coralline algae, and density of grazer. As a result, both Hyeongjeseom and Marado require preservation and management to maintain their excellent marine algal communities, and other sites on the main island require the creation and/or restoration of marine algal communities.

The independent variables were divided into three different sectors. The first sector included precautionary policies that observed eco-friendly fishing support program, institutional prevention activities, and physical barriers installation. The second sector with the current management policies included the relevant vessel operations, establishment of fishery order, fishery restructuring, and fishery ground clean-up. Thirdly, post-response policies comprised the litter purification from river to shoreline, the collection and removal of marine, sedimentary, and floating debris, purchasing salvaged debris generated while fishing, fishery waste disposal, and repairing damage caused by marine litter. The indicator used was the settlement amount by each program. The dependent variable was the estimated amount of fishery waste and the indicator was the sum of the loss of traps and gill nets and the loss of their appendages. According to the results of Kruskal-Wallis Test, the estimated amount of fishery waste was highest in the East Sea in terms of sea area and the highest in the Si(city) according to basic local municipality. The settlement amount related to the marine environment services was largest in the Gun(county).
