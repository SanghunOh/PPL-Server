Based on the population density and building database in Seoul, the population exposed to collisions in the event of a UAM crash was derived. Through the ballistic descent model, the accident impact radius of the UAM fall was calculated. In addition, the change in human casualties on the ground was analyzed when the accident impact radius increased. Finally, the ground risk map was created for Seoul, and it was confirmed that about 1 to 10 people could be injured when a UAM crash.",김연실,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108327325
UAM 시뮬레이터를 활용한 공포심과 어지러움에 대한 실증 연구,"Based on the government's willingness to commercialize UAM with the goal of 2025, it is making remarkable achievements in various fields, including the development of UAM. In addition, based on the concept of UAM, it is evolving into an Advanced Air Mobility(AAM) concept that includes commercial operation between long-distance or short-range cities, cargo delivery, public services, aviation tourism, and personal/leisure aircraft. however, research on physical problems such as low-altitude operation characteristics, speed within three dimensions, and dizziness caused by external environment has yet to be found. Therefore, in this study, actual images are taken while flying at the expected altitude and speed of UAM using a helicopter, and by experiencing it to the general public using a UAM simulator equipped with VR and Motion, physical reactions such as fear and dizziness of passengers that may occur during actual UAM operation of UAM are analyzed.",김세준,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108650671
삼각함수의 극한을 활용한 Fix-to-Fix 항법 보완,"The Fix-to-Fix Navigation is the technique for aircraft pilots to find out estimated Heading when crossing from present fix to other fix to want to go in the air. Because this is based on the Rule of Thumb method from one’s experience, it could not find out exact estimated Heading. Furthermore if the pilot nears going fix, Bearing Pointer and Course Indicator of HSI are too close to use this technique, that makes the pilot lost in the air. In this paper, We take Limits of Trigonometric Functions into the Fix-to-Fix Navigation to overcome these disadvantages. This study introduces two solutions using Limits of Trigonometric Functions when doing Fix-to-Fix Navigation and analyzes the error of this solutions.",김범수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108650676
회전익 항공기 인적요인 향상을 위한 잠재원인에 관한 연구,Around 70% of domestic aircraft accidents in helicopter aircraft. The causal factors of the helicopter accidents are identified as human factors. People have focused mostly on unsafe acts to prevent the accident. The accidents should be analysed on human factors to reduce accident. The unsafe acts can be managed effectively if the latent failures were identified through the HFACS. This paper is to introduce about the latent failure classified by the HFACS and provide the analysis regarding the latent failure of the helicopters by the aviation safety advisors through the interviews.,최진국,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104986889

항공교통관제사의 피로위험관리시스템 도입에 따른 국내 적용 방안,"This paper presents a prescriptive alternative for establishing a FRMS suitable for us based on scientific data ahead of the introduction and implementation of the FRMS for air traffic controllers in order to meet the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) international standards. I would like to present. Therefore, we confirmed the operation of each air traffic control agency against the current domestic operating standards, and compared and reviewed the operation methods and standards of air traffic control agencies in each country. The controller in Korea defines 10 hours of working hours per day, 8 hours of minimum breaks, and 40 hours per week. Currently, in the case of air traffic control agencies, the daytime and the appropriate working hours are used in the daytime, but in the nighttime, the average time exceeds 5.9 hours. In the case of 40 hours a week, they work an average of 15.7 hours overtime. By adjusting the nighttime work time, this work can be solved by diversifying the form of the worker's input method according to the personal schedule rather than the two-day (day / night) method, as well as the appropriate nighttime time distribution by supplementing the personnel.",이영종,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106510697

항공기 비상사태에 대한 객실안전조치에 관한 연구 -객실승무원의 안전업무와 승객의 객실안전정보 인식을 중심으로-,"Aircraft accidents these days, following the mega sizing trend of the aircraft, result in enormous losses of human lives apart from those of property, which cannot be replaced by any means. As most recently, in April 20, 2012, a Boeing 737 passenger plane departed Karachi on an augural flight to Islamabad, Pakistan, crashed close to an express highway on final approach, all 121 passengers and 6 crew members were killed. As such a large number of fatalities have been recorded in aircraft accidents while accident investigation results show that more than 95% of aircraft accidents are now survivable. There are three basic stages in surviving the aircraft accident: surviving the crash impact, the evacuation process and the hostile post evacuation environmental elements. These stages require the cabin crew's expeditious and appropriate actions on the basis of systematic and thorough cabin safety training in order to increase occupants' survivability, along with the passengers' preparedness. In this aspect, this paper examines the issues acting as the impediments to the passenger survival in inflight emergency situations, that are the deficiencies with cabin crew safety training, related performances and the shortcomings in passengers' knowledge on inflight safety information, leading to their inappropriate responses to emergency situations. These issues are analyzed and the root causes are identified, suggesting the resolving countermeasures.",유경인,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103446366

모의비행훈련장치 제도 개선방안 연구,"As the domestic aviation industry develops, demand for pilots is increasing. As a result, the demand for flight training using flight simulation training devices that implement the same or similar interior of aircraft is also increasing. Despite this increase in demand, domestic laws, regulations and management systems related to flight simulation training devices have remained unchanged since 2009. As a result, the criteria for designation of new or developed flight simulation training devices are ambiguous. In addition, proper improvement of the current system should be prioritized for designation of new devices such as UAM and VR, along with developing flight simulation training devices. It is intended to present measures to improve the domestic flight simulation training system by investigating and analyzing advanced cases overseas.",김세준,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107875486
몬트리올협약상의 항공여객운송인의 책임,"Until Montreal Convention was established in 1999, the Warsaw System is undoubtedly accepted private internationl air law treaty and has played major role on the carrier`s liability in international aviation transport industry. But the whole Warsaw System, though it was revised many times to meet the rapid developments of the aviation transport industry, is so complicated, tangled and outdated. This thesis, therefore, aim to introduce the Montreal Convention by interpreting it as a new legal instrument on the air carrier`s liability, specially on the passenger`s, and analyzing all the issues relating to it. The Montreal Convention markedly changed the rules governing international carriage by air. The Montreal Convention has modernized and consolidated the old Warsaw System of international instruments of private international air law into one legal instrument. One of the most significant features of the Montreal Convention is that it sifted its priority to the protection of the interest of the consumers from the protection of the carrier which originally the Warsaw Convention intended to protect the fledgling international air transport business. Two major features of the Montreal Convention adopts are the Two-tier Liability System and the Fifth Jurisdiction. In case of death or bodily injury to passengers, the Montreal Convention introduces a two-tier liability system. The first tier includes strict liability up to 100,000SDR, irrespective of carriers` fault. The second tier is based on presumption of fault of carrier and has no limit of liability. Regarding Jurisdiction, the Montreal Convention expands upon the four jurisdiction in which the carrier could be sued by adding a fifth jurisdiction, i.e., a passenger can bring suit in a country in which he or she has their permanent and principal residence and in which the carrier provides a services for the carriage of passengers by either its own aircraft or through a commercial agreement. Other features are introducing the advance payment, electronic ticketing, compulsory insurance and regulation on the contracting and actual carrier etc. As we see some major features of the Montreal Convention, the Convention heralds the single biggest change in the international aviation liability and there can be no doubt it will prevail the international aviation transport world in the future. Our government signed this Convention on 20th Sep. 2007 and it came into effect on 29th Dec. 2007 domestically. Thus, it was recognized that domestic carriers can adequately and independently manage the change of risks of liability. I, therefore, would like to suggest our country`s aviation industry including newly-born low cost carrier prepare some countermeasures domestically that are necessary to the enforcement of the Convention.",김종복 ( Jong Bok Kim ),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76379362

論文(논문) : 국내 항공운항에서 기상현상이 결항 및 지연에 미치는 영향 분석,"Last April, Europe was severly damaged as all social and economic activities came to a halt prompted by the cancellation of all flights resulting from volcanic ash. This exemplifies that the meteorology conditions have significant influence on the flights of airplanes. Hence, in this research the influence that the meteorology has on the domestic flights and its characteristics will be examined, and the core meteorological factors that influence flights in each airport will be drawn. In order to do this, statistical analysis on the influence that the meteorology has on flights was carried out in order to analyze the data about flight cancelation and delay and also its cause, primarily based on the Gimpo, Gimhae, and the Jeju airports. As a result, first, the meteorological factors which impact flight cancellation and delay were different among the domestic airports, and second, it was analyzed that fog was the main meteorological factor in the Gimpo airport, strong wind in the Jeju airport, and fog in the Gimhae airport. Third, between the day the flights were cancelled and delayed occurred, and the day that weren`t, the fact that there existed a difference among the actual meteorological factors was statistically drawn. With the result of such analysis, meteorological factors pertaining to the cancellation and delay of flights must be considered seperately by each airport and specialized meteorological information must be provided accordingly. Further, when selecting the position of an airport that is to be constructed in the future, implications that there is a definite need for the meteorology effect evaluation based on past meteorology data can be drawn.",이중우 ( Joong Woo Lee ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99885089

Thus researchers decided to use WSAT to estimate fatigue risk of cabin crews of an airline in Korea and to analyze empirically how such risk might have an effect on cabin crew’s safety behavior. This was because there had not been enough research on accessing cabin crews’ fatigue and analyzing its risk for the flight safety. In addition, the mediation effect of cabin crew’s planning was also analyzed through Sobel-test by researchers among external factors such as lack of concentration, attention deficit, distraction and safety behavior. According to empirical analysis, it was found attention deficit and distraction of cabin crews due to fatigue during the flight had a significant negative effect on their planning. Planning was also proven to have mediation effect to cabin crew’s safety behavior.",박인섭,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108287657
