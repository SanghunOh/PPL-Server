Bitter sesquiterpene lactones (BSLs) are crucial secondary metabolites of lettuce which are useful in many physiological activities, and also has been used to relieve pain. This study was conducted to appraise the variability of phenotypic characteristics and the total content of BSLs in fifty lettuce germplasm. The germplasm collections exhibited wide variation in both qualitative and quantitative characters. The average plant weight was 333.3 g with a range from 60.0 to 700.0 g and the lactucin content was varied from 3.4 (IT265031) to 448.6 (IT300287) μg/g DW with an average concentration of 94.0 μg/g DW. Whereas lactucopicrin ranged from 6.8 (IT217859) to 2,714.9 (Superseonpung) μg/g DW with an average concentration of 805.8 μg/g DW. Total BSLs content was ranged from 19.6 (IT217859) to 2,821.9 (Superseonpung) μg/g DW with the average concentration of 899.8 μg/g DW. Significant (p≤0.05) differences in lactucin, lactucopicrin and total BSLs content were found among the germplasm collections. Leafy type lettuce germplasm collections originated from South Korea revealed the highest average total BSLs content (2,821.9 μg/g DW). Principal component analyses of lactucin and lactucopicrin generated based on leaf color and plant growth type yielded two principal components, PC1 and PC2, which accounted for 60.8 and 39.2 % of the total variance, respectively. Our study provides fundamental insights on phenotypic characteristics and the total content of lactucin and lactucopicrin of lettuce germplasm which may further help researchers and breeders to produce improved lettuce varieties.",최수산나,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100393518

도보여행길과 연계한 농촌마을 활성화 방안에 관한 연구,"In recent years, the number of walking-tourists who visit Jeju olle trail are increasing every year and the ripple effect is a rapid change on the roles and leadership of local people in rural villages. The reason for the change is that most Jeju Olle Trails cuts through the rural village in Jeju island. However, most of travelers just walked along the trails, no one was interested about villages along the Olle roads. For these reasons, many rural villages would not get any benefits such as non-farm income, sales profit and also can not activate the facility of village and infrastructure. Therefore, we study on Revitalization Method for rural villages through the Analysis of characteristics of tourist in Jeju Olle Trails and a field survey research too. In this process, we investigated the status and characteristics of the rural villages of Jeju island in the first step. Then, we considered the distinct characteristics and factors for improving of the 10 places with site investigation where were recommended by Jeju Olle Corporation and Jeju Agricultural Technology Center in second step. Lastly, we arranged the resident's requirement and result of survey and interview with leaders of rural village. As a result, we suggest the activation methods for residents and leaders of rural area and this study is also expected to help management of rural villages and also is an important study to improve importance of utilizing of more people visiting in Jeju Olle Trails.",임창수,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100392198
유전자변형작물 안전성평가를 위한 영양성분 비교연구 동향,"Approvals for cultivation and import of genetically modified (GM) crops have dramatically increased around the world. Comparative compositional studies are an important aspect of safety assessments of products from GM crops and are based on substantial equivalence. Compositional analyses focus on determining similarities and differences between the compositions of the GM crops and their conventional counterparts, and thereby assessing the compositional equivalence of GM crops and their conventional comparators. The analytes, such as major constituents, key nutrients, and antinutrients, are generally determined on a crop-specific basis according to the OECD consensus document. The use of standard methods throughout the processes, such as selection of comparators, field trials, analytical methods, and statistical data analysis, is crucial. In this study, we showed the general framework of compositional studies. Literature for compositional studies of GM crops conducted abroad and in Korea was reviewed to obtain information about analytes, conventional counterparts, cultivation year, location, and statistical methods. The studies conducted abroad assessed for commercial release of GM crops such as soybean, maize, and cotton, while domestic studies were mainly performed for research in rice.

금화규(Abelmoschus manihot) 뿌리 추출물의 면역증진 및 항비만효과,"In this study, we investigated in vitro immune-enhancing and anti-obesity activity of Abelmoschus manihot roots (AMR) in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and mouse adipocytes 3T3-L1 cells. AMR increased the production of immunostimulatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in RAW264.7 cells. The inhibition of toll like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4 blocked AMR-mediated production of immunostimulatory factors in RAW264.7 cells. In addition, the inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway reduced AMR-mediated production of immunostimulatory factors. From these results, AMR is considered to have immune-enhancing activity through TLR2/4-mediated activation of MAPKs signaling pathway. In addition, AMR inhibited lipid accumulation and reduced the protein level such as CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), perilipin-1, adiponectin and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) associated with lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells, indicating that AMR may have anti-obesity activity.

일제하 양배수장형 수리조합에서의 양수기술과 단위용·배수량의 변천 (리뷰 논문),"The purpose of this study is to investigate transition of pumping technology, irrigation water requirement, and unit area drainage discharge at the Pumping station-based Irrigation Associations (PIAs) in South Korea during Japanese colonial period (1910-1945). The PIAs established pumping stations and embankments along rivers for the purpose of irrigation, drainage and flood prevention until the mid-1920s. From the late 1920s after major river improvement projects, newly established PIAs did not include the flood prevention in their purpose of establishment. The design criteria of the irrigation and drainage projects, such as irrigation water requirements, design rainfall, and allowable ponding duration were decided according to the circumstances of PIAs. The gross irrigation water requirement of paddy fields increased from the 1920s to the 1940s, and reached the level of 0.0020 m<sup>3</sup>/s/ha (19 mm/d) in the 1940s for the fairly good irrigation status in the drought. The great floods of 1930, 1933, and 1934 triggered the increase in drainage discharge in the late 1930s, leading to the unit area drainage discharge of 0.9-2.6 m<sup>3</sup>/s/km<sup>2</sup> for natural drainage and 0.3-1.1 m<sup>3</sup>/s/km<sup>2</sup> for pump drainage. Therefore, several PIAs near the major rivers could avoid repetitive floods damage.",김진수 ( Kim Jin Soo ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107254226
기후변화 시나리오에 근거한 과수 개화기 변화 및 개화 후 저온 발생 전망,"In the spring of 2018, opened-flowers of fruit trees were frozen to death due to abnormal low temperature around Jeonbuk Province and southern Gyeonggi Province areas. In the 2000s, abnormal weather is observed all over the world very frequently. As a consequence, various sectors of the society suffer from economic damage and negative effects of the abnormal weather. Moreover, recent global climate change is believed to increase the incidence of extreme weathers, which are out of the normal range of the local climate. It is necessary to identify these abnormal weather phenomena accurately and analyze the effects of them on crops in order to understand the effects of them on crop yields. This study projected the trend of the low-temperature occurrence in the future by predicting the changes in future flowering dates and quantifying the temperature distribution after flowering using climate change scenarios. This study targeted areas actually producing a major portion of pear, peach, and apple in South Korea. The results of this study predicted that the flowering dates of these fruits will be approximately 20 days earlier than the current normal year in the future (2071-2100) for the study area. Moreover, it was found that the distribution of low temperature would vary by fruit type and region to some degree. The results of this study present only a portion of fruit trees cultivars grown in South Korea. It was expected that, when this approach is applied to various crops and fruit trees, it will be possible to contribute to preparing countermeasures for climate change in the agricultural sector.",김대준,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105387837
물리적 처리조건 변화에 따른 아로니아(Aronia melancocarpa) 유래 안토시아닌 함량변화 특성,"The purpose of this study was to obtain basic data for using Aronia as a functional food material. The composition of anthocyanin was characterized and quantitated by LC-MS/MS, HPLC, and UV-VIS spectrophotometer techniques, respectively. The anthocyanin content was analyzed by temperature, time, pH, and the addition of citric acid. The UV-VIS spectrophotometer used for analysis of anthocyanin is less accurate than the LC-MS/MS method used in recent years. In the past, cyanidin-3-Glucoside was reported to be a major anthocyanin that contains Aronia. However, LC-MS/MS analysis in this study confirmed cyanidin-3-galactoside to be the major compound. The anthocyanin content of the Aronia powder began to decrease sharply at a temperature of 65 ℃ or higher when heated for 24 hours. In an aqueous solution of Aronia, the anthocyanin content was reduced by 50% at 65 ℃ for 10 hours and decreased by 85% at 85 ℃ within 10 hours. Above pH 8, the anthocyanin content was reduced by more than 50%. The results of this study will provide useful information to maintain anthocyanin content in the manufacturing process of Aronia.

식량자급률은 식량안보를 강화시키는가?,"The concept of food security has gained increasing attention in the recent ten years. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines that food security exists when all people can access food needed for a healthy and active life at all times. Achieving food security means the situation where sufficient food is available, food supply is relatively stable, and those in need of food can afford food at a reasonable cost. However, there are conflicting opinions about how to achieve food security. Agricultural exporting countries insist that the diversification of food sources and domestic self-reliance as well contributes to enhancing food security. On the other hand, agricultural importing countries emphasize food self-sufficiency for major crops, especially after experiencing the major food crises across the globe during the agflation period between 2006 and 2011.
This study investigates whether domestic agricultural production contributes to strengthening food security. Using the panel data for food self-sufficiency rate, we analyzed domestic grain price and food riots, the effect of domestic food production on food security or the probability of food riots. The results show that the increase in food self-sufficiency strengthens food security and reduces the probability of food riots, while lower import tariffs do not.",김태화,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107946426

형질전환 식물세포배양을 이용한 바이오의약품 생산,"Transgenic plant cell cultures for the production of biopharmaceuticals including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins have been regarded as an alternative platform in addition to traditional microbial fermentation and mammalian cell cultures. Plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) have several advantages such as safety, cost-effectiveness, scalability and possibility of complex post-translational modifications. Increasing demand for the quantity and diversity of pharmaceutical proteins may accelerate the industrialization of PMP technology. Up to date, there is no plant-made recombinant protein approved by USFDA (Food and Drug Administration) for human therapeutic uses due to the technological bottlenecks of low expression level and slight differences in glycosylation. Regarding expression levels, it is possible to improve the productivity by using stronger promoter and optimizing culture processes. In terms of glycosylation, humanization has been attempted in many ways to reduce immune responses and to enhance the efficacy as well as stability.

Existing prior data lacked research on rural areas, and specific empty house guidelines in Japan were revised to suit the current status of local governments in rural areas, not rural areas, and analyzed to derive indicators suitable for rural areas in Korea. During the field survey in rural areas, Japanese indicators derived were verified to be applied to rural areas, and indicators that could be added to the rating evaluation of vacant houses were also discovered.",김용균 ( Kim Yong-gyun ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106057397
