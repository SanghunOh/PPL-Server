In order to analyze depression-related forest therapy programs, as a result of collecting thesis and winners of the program and forest therapy program competition developed by the Korea Forest Welfare Institute from 2008 to 2020, 49programs and 249 detailed programs were derived. The subject, activity goal, activity type, therapeutic approach, five senses, season, activity period, activity time, and activity location were analyzed according to the survey form. As a result of the analysis, when composing depression-related forest therapy program activities, the subjects were those with COVID-19 symptoms and those with each life cycle, and the psychological and emotional areas were considered the most. As for the activity type, physical activity was most frequently used, psychotherapy was the most applied as the therapeutic approach, and various therapies were included, not just monotherapy, especially in programs that used two therapies simultaneously. Tactile elements are the most widely used as the five senses elements, most programs were operated in spring, summer, and autumn in the season, and the activity period and time were organized to take less than 120 minutes as multiple-time programs. Most activity sites were conducted outdoors using forest roads, and non-face-to-face programs were also developed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, so far, depression-related forest therapy programs have been conducted for all ages who are likely to complain of depression or be exposed to depression rather than for patients suffering from depression. Therefore, in the future, it is considered that a multi-faceted study is needed so that forest therapy programs suitable for depressive patients can be conducted through specialization in the development of forest therapy programs.",전진영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530585

산림치유 활동이 노인에게 미치는 효과에 대한 체계적 문헌고찰,"Life expectancy is increasing due to the aging of the population, which is in turn exacerbating problems such as the prevalence of various geriatric diseases. This study was established to provide basic data for the expansion of forest healing activities for the elderly by systematically analyzing the literature on how such activities affect this age group. For the collection of studies, the Korean databases RISS, KISS, Korea Med, and Science On were used, while PubMed, Cochrane Central, MDPI, and Google Scholar were used to identify reports published elsewhere. To assess the quality of the methodology used in the collected studies, the risk of bias was analyzed using Cochrane’s RoB2 and RoBANS. Among 1,856 reports initially identified, 21 were finally selected for analysis in this study, which were limited to research papers on forest healing activities for the elderly published between 2000 and January 2022.
In this review, the subjects were those aged 60 or older, with a total of 750 participants, ranging from at least 7 to a maximum of 88 per study. The analysis showed that the most frequently performed tests in each category were on depression as a psychological indicator in 7 studies, MMSE(Mini Mental State Examination) as a cognitive indicator in 2 studies, on blood pressure as a physiological indicator in 4 studies, on melatonin as a biochemical indicator in 2 studies, and on body fat and muscle strength as physical indicators in 3 studies. Of the 21 studies, 19 used two or more test items, with psychological indicators being most commonly measured.

고령화 시대의 노인 대상 산림치유 프로그램 특성 분석,"This study aims to provide basis for the systematic development of future forest healing programs for elderly. To this end, 31 forest healing programs for the elderly were collected among the national healing forest programs. The programs were analyzed based on the program target, affiliation, movement, place, and number of unit programs. Furthermore, 111 unit programs were extracted from these 31 forest healing programs. Unit programs were analyzed by the program targets based on the program objective, five senses, and therapy. As a result of the program analysis, 64.5% of the forest healing programs were for the elderly in general, and 80.6% of the programs were managed without affiliation. The ratio of 'static' programs was 58.1%, and 54.8% were taken both indoor and outdoor. The average number of unit programs was 3.94. In terms of unit program analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between unit program characteristics when classified into the programs for the elderly in general and those for the elderly with disabilities or chronic diseases. The unit programs were aimed at improving health in the order of psycho·emotional, physical, cognitive, and social in common. In the case of the five senses, the proportion of unit programs that stimulated visual sense was the largest while the sense of tasting was stimulated the least. In the case of therapy, exercise therapy and climate therapy were used the most, while diet and water therapy were used the least. Based on the analysis results, providing specialized programs for each target and actively using items with a relatively small weight were suggested for program diversification.",박준혁,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107071486

대기오염물질의 산림생태계내 유입과 토양의 화학적 특성 변화,"Environmental pollution has recently been progressed in the metropolitan and industrial areas of Korea and concerns have been evolved against the chronic effects of the pollution on natural ecosystem. This study was carried out to investigate the environmental pollution impacts on ion input into forest ecosystems and soil environmental changes. Study plots were established at Seoul, Ulsan, Yeochon, and Seosan for pollution sites and at Pyungchang for a non-pollution site. Atmospheric deposition was measured with rain, throughfall, and stem flow samples collected in the forest areas. Soil chemical properties were investigated to compare the pollution impacts on the sites. Precipitation acidity in the metropolitan and industrial areas ranged from pH 4.5 to 5.5, showing the levels lower than pH 5.8 of mountain area. Ion concentrations in the precipitation had increased significantly while passing the crown layer in the metropolitan and industrial areas, showing the increase by 4 times at the maximum. Total ion input in the metropolitan and industrial areas was greater than that in mountain area by approximately 2-3 times. Soil acidification caused by acidic ion input seemed to be greatest at Seoul, showing pH 1 decrease compared to that of Pyungchang. Soil canon contents were relatively high in the metropolitan and industrial areas. Although the canon leaching loss was not apparent, soil acidification process seemed to be continued by acidic ion input. Environmental pollution in the metropolitan and industrial areas exerted changes in ion input into the forest ecosystems and soil conditions.

SWOT 분석을 통한 괴산 산림복지단지 활성화 방안 연구,"Due to the recent prolonged corona virus, a different lifestyle is appearing than before the outbreak of COVID-19. These changes have also changed the national leisure life, and it has become clear that there is a tendency to prefer safe, low-density outdoor activities with family in nature-friendly spaces rather than enclosed indoor tourism activities. Goesan Forest Welfare Complex aims to actively respond to the changing national leisure trend and to revitalize the local economy in the mountain villages, which are on the verge of extinction due to population decline. For this purpose, SWOT analysis was conducted on 30 related experts. As a result of the first questionnaire analysis for deriving SWOT factors, a total of 16 factors, 4 for each group, were derived to complete the SWOT Matrix. Afterwards, a second questionnaire was conducted to determine the relative importance and priorities of the 16 derived factors. Based on the results of the secondary questionnaire analysis, the top priority factors for each group were selected and strategies were derived. As a result of deriving SWOT factors, it was found that the strength of the highest priority was that most of Bakdal Mountain was a forest area of national and public forests, and the forest resources were abundant and there were no hindrance factors for private facilities, so the scenery was excellent. The weakness of the top priority is that the characterization factors of Goesan Forest Welfare Complex are weak. The top priority opportunity factor is that a synergy effect can be expected in connection with walking-oriented tourist attractions. In addition, the top priority threat factor is population decline due to the outflow of young and elderly people and securing local experts due to aging. appeared to be difficult. Based on the results of this study, it was found that in order to revitalize the Goesan Forest Welfare Complex, it is necessary to use the abundant forest resources of the Goesan Forest Welfare Complex to discover specialization factors that differentiate it from the surrounding tourist sites, and to secure professional manpower in the area. To this end, continuous feedback on the introduction and operation of new businesses should be made by experts in other fields as well as experts in related fields.

A total of 20 maple trees of various ages and diameters were destructively harvested to determine their dry weight and carbon concentration by component. The allometric equations with DBH and DBH2×H as independent variables were developed to estimate the carbon storage for each tree component. The carbon concentration of tree components was the highest in stem wood (49.8%) and lowest in stem bark (46.5%). Allometric equations to estimate the carbon storage of tree components (stem, root, aboveground, and total) showed a similar coefficient of determinations (R2 ) between the allometric equations of the logarithmic method (0.7494-0.9036) and the GMM (0.7085-0.8847). However, the R2 values of the leaves and branches were in the range of 0.3027 to 0.6380, lower than those of the R2 of the other tree components.

온대중부 혼효림의 겨울철 치유환경 특성에 관한 연구,"This study aims to measure the therapeutic capacity of mixed forests in the central temperate zone, a climate environment observed in most regions of Korea. To analyze the therapeutic forest environment, a total of four therapeutic environmental factors including phytoncide (Natural Volatile Organic Compounds; NVOCs), fine dust (PM2.5), microclimate environment (weather and thermal environment), and anion were selected and measured. A mixed forest located near Bomun Mountain, Daejeon, was examined on three separate occasions. Three different sites having different species of trees were selected for measurement: a deciduous forest, a mixed forest of predominantly deciduous trees, and a mixed forest of predominantly coniferous trees. Total NVOCs (TNVOCs) at each site was measured: 1.17 ng/m3 in the deciduous forest; 0.94 ng/m3 in the deciduous-dominating mixed forest; and 0.97 ng/m3 in the coniferous-dominating mixed forest. The PM2.5 concentration was 65.3, 65.5, and 59.0 μg/m3 in the three forests, respectively. Anion concentration was 433, 477, and 510 ea/cm3 in these forests, respectively. Given that the observation was made during last autumn and winter, these forests are expected to provide a therapeutic environment comparable to that of Pinus densiflora forests and Chamaecyparis obtusa forests, which are representative of coniferous forests in Korea.

도시공원에 식재된 왕벚나무 수종을 중심으로 한수목활력도의 정량평가지표 개발 및 이론적 고찰에 관한 연구,"The vigor condition of trees is an important indicator for the management of urban forested area. But difficulties in how to assess the tree vigor condition still remain. Previous efforts were limited in the 1) measurement of single indicator rather than using multiple indices, 2) purpose-oriented measurement such as for air-pollution effect or specific pathological symptom, and 3) ordinal-scale evaluations by field crews 4) despite human errors based on his/her experiences or prior knowledge. Therefore, this study attempted to develop a quantitative and objective methodology for assessing tree vigor condition, by measuring multiple modules and building the profile inventory. Furthermore, the possibility and limitations were discussed in terms of schematic frames describing tree vigor condition. The vigor condition of 56 flowering cherry plants in urban park were assessed by in-situ measurements of following eight items; growth of crown(Gc), growth of shoots, individual tree volume(Vol), plant area index, woody area index, leaf area index, leaf chlorophyll content(Lc) and leaf water content(Lw). For validation, these measurements were compared with the ranks of holistic tree vigor condition, which were visually assessed using a 4-point grading scale based on the expert`s knowledge. As a result, the measures of each evaluation item successfully highlighted a variety of aspects in tree vigor condition, including the states of both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic parts. The variation in the results depending on evaluated parts was shown within an individual tree, even though the broad agreement among the results was found. The result of correlation analysis between the tested measurements and 4-point visual assessment, demonstrated that the state of water-stressed foliage of the season (Lw) or the development of plant materials since sapling phase (Vol) could be better viewed from the outer appearance of trees than other symptoms. But only based on the visual assessment, it may be difficult to detect the quality of photosynthesis (Lc) or the recent trend in growth of trees (Gc). To make this methodology simplified for the broad-scale application, the tested eight measurements could be integrated into two components by principal component analysis, which was labelled with ‘the amount of plant materials’ and ‘vigor trend’, respectively. In addition, the use of these quantitative and multi-scale indicators underlies the importance of assessing various aspects of tree vigor condition, taking into account the response(s) on different time and spatial scale of pressure(s) shown in each evaluated module. Future study should be advanced for various species at diverse developing stages and environment, and the application to wide areas at a periodic manner.",송영근 ( Young Keun Song ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108402599
산림산업 특수분류에 따른 산림복지산업 업체수 현황 분석,"Forestry, which is the primary industry, was only classified as the Korean standard classification, but in December 2020, the Statistic korea established a special classification of the agricultural, livestock and food industry and classified the forest industry included 130 sub-class industries. The forest industry can accurately identify the size of the industry and the status of the company through special classification, but a lot of budget and time are needed because the entire forest industry needs to be investigated. Of the 130 classification industries related to the forest industry, 94 industries were not related to the forest industry, and the population status of 94 industries was based on the national business survey statistics that surveyed the detailed industries of the Korean standard classification. However, if the entire industry linked to the Korean standard classification classification is a forest industry, that is, wood and wood product manufacturing can be seen as 100% forest industry, but the classification mixed with other industries, such as seed and seed wholesale, is mixed with agriculture, so it is necessary to investigate how much forest industry accounts for this classification. The survey was conducted in 25,000 samples based on the National Business Survey DB of the Statistic Korea, and the size of this sample is ±0.59%p at the 95% confidence level of the sample error. The sample distribution was distributed proportionally according to the total number of workers by industry, and was investigated through a telephone survey. As a result of the survey, the number of companies operating in the forest industry in 130 sub-class industries was estimated to be 134,447.

산림경영활동에 따른 수종별 지상부생물량 및 목재생산량 변화 모델링: 가리왕산 모델숲을 대상으로,"The forest protection policies implemented in South Korea have resulted in the significant accumulation of forest. Moreover, the associated public interest has also been closely evaluated. As forests mature, there arises a need for forest management (FM) practices, such as thinning and harvesting. It is therefore essential to perform a scientific analysis of the long-term effects of FM. In this study, conducted in Mt. Gariwang, the effect of FM on forest succession and wood production (WP) were evaluated based on changes in aboveground biomass (AGB) using the LANDIS-II model. The FM consists of three scenarios (Selection, Shelterwood, and Two-stories), characterized based on the harvest intensity, frequency, and period. The model was applied to changes in the forest over 200 years.
All scenarios show that the total AGB decreased immediately after thinning and harvesting. However, AGB recovery time differed among scenarios, with recovery to preharvest level occurring from 15 to 50 years after harvest; further, after 200 years, harvested forests had a greater total AGB than forests without FMs In particular, the changes in AGB of each species was different depending on its shade tolerance. The AGB of currently dominant shade-intolerant and mid-tolerant species decreased dramatically after harvesting. However, shade-tolerant species, dominant in the understory, continued to grow but were not harvested due to their small size. The cumulative WP for each scenario was estimated at 545.6, 141.6, and 299.9 tons/ha in Selection, Shelterwood, and Two-stories, respectively. The composition of WP differed according to harvest intensity and period. Most WP originated from shade-intolerant and mid-tolerant species in the early period. Later, most WP was from shade-tolerant species, which became dominant.
The modeling approach used in this study is capable of analyzing the long-term effects of FM on changes in forests and WP. This study can contribute to decision making to guide FM methods for a variety of purposes, including WP and controlling forest composition and structure.",조원희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107977784
생태면적률과 투수포장 비율의 시계열 분석을 통한 경의선숲길의 물 순환체계 특성 분석,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the hydrologic cycle environment of Gyeongui Line Forest Park, a linear city park, in order to improve hydrologic cycle systems in urban areas. The method of the study is the Biotope Area Ratio and the Permeable ratio survey. The study subject is the Gyeongui Line Forest Park, created in 2016 as a linear park in Seoul. The results showed that the Biotope Area Ratio improved by 31.2% (31,927m 2 ) from 35.7% (36,480m 2 ) in 2000 to 66.9% (68,407m 2 ) in 2019 on a site area of 102,117m 2 . Next, the Permeable ratio improved by 43.8% from 29.0% to 72.8%, and the impermeable ratio decreased by 43.8% from 71.0% to 27.2%. The Biotope Area Ratio ex- ceeded the target ratio of 60% by 6.9%, set by the Ministry of Environment. The ratio of green space exceeded the target ratio of 60%, by 4.0%. And so they contributed to the improvement of the hydro- logic cycle by the creation of the Gyeongui Line Forest Park. Urban parks need to exceed the Biotope Area Ratio and the green area ratio of the legal standards, especially when creating large parks of over 100,000 square meters, in the era of climate change. It is necessary to continuously plant trees in the space where trees can be planted, and to contribute to the improvement of the hydrologic cycle system and urban heat island effect by conducting three-dimensional",김미후,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107774697
식재밀도에 따른 물푸레나무 조림목 식재 후 7년간의 생장 특성,"This study aimed to determine the optimal planting density of Fraxinus rhynchophylla assessed from the early growth performance at various planting densities over the 7-year period after planting. The study site was in Pyeongchang County, South Korea, and seedlings of 2-year-old (bare-root seedlings) F. rhynchophylla were planted at four densities (3,000, 5,000, 7,000, and 10,000 trees ha-1) in March 2015. The survival rate, root-collar diameter (RCD), and height (H) were measured from 2015 to 2021, and the H/D (H/RCD) ratio and stem volume were cal- culated. The survival rate (84-97%) and H/D ratio (54.5-59.2%) were not affected by the planting density during the study period, but the RCD, H, and stem volume were significantly higher for 7,000 trees ha-1 than for other planting densities. Especially, the stem volume (cm3 tree-1) at 7 years after planting was highest for 7,000 trees ha-1 (1,356.1), followed by 10,000 trees ha-1 (958.6), 5,000 trees ha-1 (773.0), and 3,000 trees ha-1 (579.5). As the planting density increased, F. rhynchophylla seedlings showed initial rapid growth due to light competition, but relatively low growth at excessive planting densities. In the future, use of a suitable planting density considering planting costs should pro- vide outstanding growth performance of F. rhynchophylla on plantations.",한승현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107339983
"산림 내 호수 주변에서의 산책과 경관감상이 인체에 미치는 생리적, 심리적 영향","The aim of this study was to clarify the physiological and psychological effects of walking around and viewing a lake in a forest environment. The subjects included 11 male Japanese university students (age: 22.0±1.2 years) who were randomly assigned to visit either a forest or an urban (control) setting. They were instructed to walk a predetermined 15-min course and to view the setting from a seated position for 15 min. Heart rate variability, heart rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, and salivary cortisol levels were measured to assess the subject’s physiological responses to the environment. Four questionnaires (SD method, reports of “refreshed” feeling, POMS, and STAI) were administered to assess the subjects’ psychological responses. It was found that walking around and viewing a lake in a forest environment can suppress sympathetic nerve activity, increase parasympathetic nerve activity, and decrease the heart rate, blood pressure, pulse rate, and cortisol levels. In addition, a forest environment can enhance the “comfortable,” “soothing,” “natural,” and “refreshed” feelings, improve the mood state, and reduce anxiety. These results provide scientific evidence of the physiological and psychological effects of forest therapy.",송초롱 ( Cho Rong Song ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108402607
숲가꾸기를 위한 풀베기와 칡덩굴제거작업의 근골격계 부담 분석,"A forest operation is considered as one of the riskiest environments for the development of musculoskeletal disorders because operators are exposed to harmful environmental conditions such as rough terrain, inclement weather, and poor working postures. In weed and kudzu removal operations, manual application is still common in Korea. In this study, we evaluated the ergonomic conditions of weed and kudzu removal in regeneration forests and the associated risk of musculoskeletal disorders. The risk of musculoskeletal disorders was evaluated using the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System and postural risk index. Postural risk was significantly higher for kudzu compared with weed removal operations. This suggests that kudzu removal operations must be improved to decrease postural risk.",이은재,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108282816

The development of HSI and SI (Suitability Index) model was conducted based on the existing literature, field surveys, and expert opinions for information on ecological habitat characteristics. Seven variables were selected as habitat variables including mean maximum temperature in Jul.-Aug., lighting, slope, altitude, effective soil depth, soil texture, and artificial overexploitation (i.e. protected areas). HSI model was developed for C. guttaum based on these variables. This HSI model showed high applicability to selection and evaluation of replacement habitats for C. guttaum. Our findings could provide the basic information on habitat assessment to prevent the extinction of endangered C. guttatum. However, since there is a limitation that the survey data were insufficient, further field surveys should be conducted on several habitat types to improve the accuracy of the HSI model.",윤영준,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103428676

훼손된 도시생태계 생태복원 평가지표 제시 및 복원성과 분석,"This study aims to analyze the effect of urban ecosystem restoration projects by evaluating the short-term restoration performance of the project sites, from both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In this study, for the qualitative evaluation, we derived the evaluation frame from previous studies and literature. For the quantitative evaluation, the changes in ecological connectivity after the restoration project were described using landscape permeability and network analysis. In addition, changes in habitat quality after the restoration project were evaluated by using InVEST Habitat Quality Model. These evaluations were applied to the three natural madang (ecological restoration) projects and two ecosystem conservation cooperation projects.
As a result, three categories, 10 indicators, and 13 sub-indicators were derived from literature as the evaluation frame for this study. In the case of quantitative evaluation of restoration performance, habitat quality increased by 45% and ecological connectivity by 37% in natural-madang, and habitat quality by about 12% and ecological connectivity by about 19% in ecosystem conservation cooperation projects. This implies that the ecological restoration project can increase the ecological connectivity and the habitat quality of degraded sites even in a short period of time by improving the land-cover and land use. The results by applying the evaluation frame indicated that ecological and environmental factors and the ecological functions were improved by the restoration works, even though the magni- tude of performances were diverse depending on the specific evaluation items, project type, and site characteristics. This study clarified that the success of ecological restoration project should be assessed by both of the short-term and long-term goals, which can be achieved by the maintenance and sustain- able management, respectively.",손희정,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530588
고속도로 비탈면 식생 모니터링을 통한 녹화공법 평가기준 연구,"A study was conducted to present the criteria for evaluating the revegetation method of the slope of the expressway. The results of comparative analysis between 2019-2020 field survey and existing research data (2015-2016) are as follows. Soil is a very important factor at the beginning of revegetation work. However, after the plant has settled, the importance of the soil composition diminishes. Among the plants used, the number of plants sown at the beginning gradually decreases. And it changes as it competes with invading plants. Among the plants used for sowing, it was found to affect the vegetation composition in the order of exotic grass > native herb and wildflower > native tree. Plant coverage is continuously evaluated as an important factor regardless of the time. The vegetation structure on the slope will change continuously over time. New items need to be evaluated in situations where a lot of time has elapsed since the application of revegetation work. It is desirable to use the current evaluation standard only to perform the evaluation within 1 to 2 years. In the long run, it is necessary to establish a new evaluation standard that adjusts the weights of each item.",김경훈 ( Kim Kyung-hoon ),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82697000

The research area is Ardeidae species(ASP) habitat and has long-term monitoring. The purpose of the study is to compare the ASP populations which analyzed ground observational survey and UAVs imagery. We used DJI's Mavic pro and Phantom4 for this research. Before investigating the population of ASP, we measured the escape distance by the UAVs, and the escape distances of the two UAVs models were statistically significant. Such a result would be different in UAV size and rotor(rotary wing) noise. The population of ASP who analyzed the ground observation and UAVs imagery count differed greatly. In detail, the population(mean) on the ground observation was 174.9, and the UAVs was 247.1 ~ 249.9. As a result of analyzing the UAVs imagery, These results indicate that the lower the UAVs camera altitude, the higher the ASP population, and the lower the UAVs camera altitude, the higher the resolution of the images and the better the reading of the individual of ASP. And we confirmed analyzed images taken at various altitudes, the individuals of ASP was not statistically significant. This is because the resolution of the phantom was superior to that of mavic pro. Our research is fundamental compared to similar studies. However, long-term monitoring for ASP of South Korea's by ground observation is a barrier of the reliability of the monitoring result.
