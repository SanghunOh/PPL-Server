Based on protein sources, alternative proteins can be divided into plant-based meat, animal cell-cultured meat, and edible insect. Alternative meat market will keep growing and accounting for 11% of the total protein food market by 2035. America has the largest share in the alternative protein market. Many food companies and startups are developing and distributing alternative proteins in Korea which is ranked 38th. Among them, plant based meat shows advantages in terms of production cost and safety verification, but may present some issues that include anti-nutrients and allergens. Animal-derived cell cultured meat can best mimic traditional meat products, but may have concerns for food safety and high production cost. In order to shift from traditional animal based meat production into extraction-, fermentation-, or culture-based alternative protein manufacturing system, it is necessary to understand the origins, pros and cons, and the current status of research and market for better forecast their future promises and challenges.",조창준(Changjun Cho),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108348115
장내 마이크로바이옴과 치매,"The lack of an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stems primarily from incomplete understanding of AD’s causes. A rapidly growing number of scientific reports highlight important roles played by peripheral infections and intestinal bacterial flora in pathological and physiological functions involving the microbiome-intestine-brain axis. The microbiome controls basic aspects of the central nervous system (CNS), immunity, and behavior, in health and disease. Changes in the density and composition of the microbiome have been linked to disorders of the immune, endocrine, and nervous systems, including mood changes, depression, increased susceptibility to stressors, and autistic behaviors. There is no doubt that in patients with AD, restoration of the intestinal microbiome to a composition reminiscent of that found in healthy adult humans will significantly slow the progression of neurodegeneration, by ameliorating inflammatory reactions and/or amyloidogenesis. In the near future, better understanding of bidirectional communication between the brain and microbiota will allow the development of functional diets using specific probiotic bacteria.",설국환 ( Kuk-hwan Seol ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107881045
축산농장 동물복지의 윤리적 갈등과 딜레마 극복: 국내 산란계 농장에서의 윤리의식 수준에 따른 동물복지 관련법규 준수여부 상관관계 조사,"Animal welfare was introduced relatively late to Korea in comparison with Western countries. Nonetheless, the Korean government has continuously improved animal welfare-friendly regulations as policy instruments. Given the current situation, it is predicted that spontaneous settlement of the animal welfare policies will be difficult and may cause conflict in the farm animal industry. To identify and categorize conflicts caused by animal-welfare-related policies in the last five years, we investigated the awareness of animal welfare among Korean hen farms and the level of compliance with the animal welfare regulations. We collected a sample of 53 egg-laying chicken farm operators (e.g., owners or head managers) was collected through the on-site survey (90% confidence level (Z-score: 1.65) and 10.18% tolerance, based on a number of 797 egg-laying farms in 2020). Ethical conflicts on the farms were categorized into three different types according to the hen farm's ethical awareness level: passive, moderate, and active. Additionally, we investigated the correlation between compliance with regulations and ethical consideration. This study confirmed that compliance with animal welfare-related regulations significantly correlated to the level of ethical consideration of farm operators. Interestingly, we also observed that farm operators did not comply with the regulation despite their high level of awareness of animal welfare. This conflict implies contradiction and unresolved ethical dilemmas. Therefore, this study argues that the policies cause conflict in the field despite the certain level of effectiveness on animal welfare regulations.",이본,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2077873

The questionnaire was distributed to 80 TMR manufacturing companies for 10 months and 50 questionnaires were collected. The questionnaire was consisted of 17 questions and the data were analyzed by descriptive statistic analysis, cross relation analysis and reliability. The main perception was imposing the feed safety management system should be followed after building institutional condition for the feed safety management. The most required condition was providing and sharing information on feed safety to establish feed safety management system. According to the research, the most weak point during managing feed safety and harmful factors was the mold toxin. The most hazard factors during feed manufacturing steps were foreign substances such as metal, fragment and soil. Upon investigation on pollution level of feed's hazard factor, cadmium, arsenic and selenium were exceeded standard of permission but ochratoxin, aflatoxin, melamine and Nonprotein nitrogen were not exceeded. Pesticide residual, fumonisin and salmonella were not detected. As the result of the analyses, to construct the feed safety management system of TMR manufacturing company, it is necessary to politically institutionalize the providing and haring information of feed safety.

판람근 추출물의 항산화 특성 및 돈육패티에서 아질산나트륨 대체효과,"This study investigated the antioxidant properties of the Radix isatidis extract and the effect of substituting it with sodium nitrite (SN) in a pork patty. The antioxidant activity of the Radix isatidis water extract (RIWE) was compared to those of the methanol and chloroform extracts (RIME and RICE, respectively). Patties were prepared with five different treatments: (1) a control with no RIWE and SN, (2) T1 with 150 ppm SN, (3) T2 with 100 ppm SN + 0.1% RIWE, (4) T3 with 50 ppm SN + 0.3% RIWE, and (5) T4 with 0.5% RIWE. They were used to compare the oxidation stability for 12 days at 4℃. The extraction yield of RIWE was 3.2 and 18.7 times higher (p<0.05) than those of RIME and RICE, respectively, but RIWE had the lowest (p<0.05) 1,1`-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity, superoxide dismutase-like activity, and total reducing ability. Patties with RIWE and SN exhibited lower (p<0.05) pH values after 12 days, compared to the control. After 4 days, the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content was lower (p<0.05) in T1, T2, T3, and T4 than in the control. The oxidation-reduction potential value was the lowest (p<0.05) in T3 and T4 after 4 days (p<0.05). T1, T2, T3, and T4 had a lower (p<0.05) volatile basic nitrogen content after 12 days, compared to the control.

"솔라닌을 함유한 감자의 급여가 흰쥐의 혈액내 칼슘 , 인 , 마그네슘 및 Hydroxyproline 의 농도에 미치는 영향","An experiment was conducted utilizing 40 male rats randomly distributed into eight groups to determine the effects of feeding four different dietary levels of solanine-containing potato upon blood composition. Two potato varieties differing in their solanine content were compared. Vitamin D was added to certain diets to compare the additive effect of solanine and vitamin D. Calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and hydroxyproline were analyzed. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium appeared to be somewhat decreased in the solanine-fed rats, though there was no distinguishable pattern to the percent decrease as a function of potato variety and vitamin D level. Serum hydroxyproline levels were decreased in solanine-fed rats, the percent decrease being roughly proportional to the amount of potato in the diet. Vitamin D exerted an additive effect in decreasing hydroxyproline levels. Weights. gain remained relatively unaffected by the addition of up to 30% potato in the diet. Solanine, a glycoalkaloid Found in sun-exposed potatoes, appears to exert a vitamin D-like effect in increasing calcium absorption. This is suggested by low serum hydroxyproline levels in solarine-fed rats, indicative of decreased bone resorption and increased tissue calcium concentration. Within the experimental confines of this project, it seem, reasonable to conclude that solanine exerts a more potent effect than vitamin D upon increasing calcium absorption.",윤덕진 ( Doug Jin Yoon,1979,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106041278

"RESEARCH : Open Access : GAPDH, β-actin and β2-microglobulin, as three common reference genes, are not reliable for gene expression studies in equine adipose- and marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells","Background: Quantitative real time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most important techniques for gene-expression analysis in molecular based studies. Selecting a proper internal control gene for normalizing data is a crucial step in gene expression analysis via this method. The expression levels of reference genes should be remained constant among cells in different tissues. However, it seems that the location of cells in different tissues might influence their expression. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has any effect on expression level of three common reference genes (GAPDH, β-actin and β2-microglobulin) in equine marrow- and adipose- derived undifferentiated MSCs and consequently their reliability for comparative qRT-PCR. Materials and methods: Adipose tissue (AT) and bone marrow (BM) samples were harvested from 3 mares. MSCs were isolated and cultured until passage 3 (P3). Total RNA of P3 cells was extracted for cDNA synthesis. The generated cDNAs were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The PCR reactions were ended with a melting curve analysis to verify the specificity of amplicon. Results: The expression levels of GAPDH were significantly different between AT- and BM- derived MSCs (p < 0.05). Differences in expression level of β-actin (P < 0.001) and B2M (P < 0.006.) between MSCs derived from AT and BM were substantially higher than GAPDH. In addition, the fold change in expression levels of GAPDH, β-actin and B2M in AT-derived MSCs compared to BM-derived MSCs were 2.38, 6.76 and 7.76, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that GAPDH and especially β-actin and B2M express in different levels in equine AT- and BM- derived MSCs. Thus they cannot be considered as reliable reference genes for comparative quantitative gene expression analysis in MSCs derived from equine bone marrow and adipose tissue.",( Fatemeh Nazari ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103058441
자연치즈의 제조과정 중 숙성의 중요성,"The ripening of cheese allows for the development of characteristic taste and flavour, nutritional substances, bio-active components and texture, helping to improve quality. Many different microbiological, biochemical and nutritional changes occur during the process depending on the quality of raw milk, added cultures and enzymes, as well as specific processing and ripening conditions. During the ripening lactose is hydrolyzed to lactic, propionic and acetic acid, helping to reduce potential effects of the problem of lactose intolerance. Fat is hydrolyzed to butyric, propionic and conjugated linoleic acid, which function as bio-active substances. Protein is hydrolyzed to different peptides and amino acids which all show various bio-activities. However, errors of cheese ripening can happen and affect the quality of the product. To guarantee good quality cheese the process needs to be managed carefully with the right microbes used and ensuring cleanliness of processing facilities, staff, ventilation and hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP).

"Comparison of reducing sugar content, sensory traits, and fatty acids and volatile compound profiles of the longissimus thoracis among Korean cattle, Holsteins, and Angus steers","Objective: This study was performed to compare fat content, reducing sugar contents, sensory traits, and fatty acid (FA) and volatile compound profiles in longissimus thoracis (LT) among Korean cattle (KC), Holstein (HO), and Angus (AN) steers.
Methods: Twelve LT samples (about 500 g each) of KC with an average age of 31±0.42 months, an average carcass weight of 431±12.5 kg, and a quality grade (QG) of 1+ were obtained from the joint livestock products market. Twelve LT samples of HO cattle with an average age of 24±0.54 months, an average carcass weight of 402±7.81 kg, and a QG of 2 were also obtained from the same market. Twelve LT samples of AN steers with an average age of about 20 months and a QG of choice were purchased from a beef delivery company. After slaughter, samples were kept at 4°C for 42 days and prepared for immediate analysis or stored at appropriate conditions. The chemical composition, color, pH, shear force, collagen content, reducing sugars, sensory evaluation, FA composition, and volatile compound content for each LT sample were analyzed.
Results: The LT of KC had the highest (p<0.05) fat content, the highest reducing sugar content, and the highest scores in the sensory evaluation (flavor, tenderness, juiciness, and overall acceptance). All the sensory traits were positively correlated (p<0.001) with intramuscular fat and reducing sugar content. Several FAs and volatile compound profiles varied among the breeds. KC LT had the highest (p<0.05) concentrations of acetaldehyde, 3-methyl butanal, and 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, and these volatile compounds were positively correlated (p<0.05) with all the sensory traits.
Conclusion: Variations in fat content and reducing sugar contents and FA and volatile compound profiles may contribute to differences in the sensory quality of LT among breeds.",Min Yu Piao,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104376142
