Especially in the case of disabled children, the disability may result in causing serious problems of reduction in much potentialities they deserve in the early stage of development. Children's disability includes trauma of cerebral palsy, spinabifida, neurogical, spiral cord, and brain impairments, etc. The problem of theses disabilities arise in muscle motors such as fine-and gross-motor skills, the coordination as visual motor cooperation, or in cognition of maintaining the concentration ability, or of long and short memorizings. Various alternative therapies must be needed for the children in order to gain their rehabilitation and social restoration influences, and are recently common in the United States. Horticultural therapy being one of them is known to have noted benefits for the disabled with multi-motor skills, responsibility for taking care of raising plants, cognitive skills of self-esteem, and motivation. Horticultural therapy either alone in combination with other alternative means as music or pet therapy for the disabled children have also been documented often, and known to increase subscaling in depression, hyperactivity, social interaction, depression, anxiety and intellectual screening. Horticultural activities by the disabled children are likewise supposed to provide them with a wise range of educational opportunities through various practical hand-on experiences. These information of the beneficial activity are the example of Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine and Kluge Children's Rehabilitation Center recently operating in the United State.",곽혜란,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107887826
식물바이러스 면역반응 최신 연구 동향 및 전망,"Plant viruses cause significant yield losses and continuously threaten crop production, representing a serious threat to global food security. Studies on plant-virus interactions have contributed to increase our knowledge on plant immunity mechanism, providing new strategies for crop improvement. The prophylactic managements consist mainly following international legislations, eradication of infected plants, and application of pesticide to decrease the population of vectors. Hence, putting together the pieces of knowledge related to molecular plant immunity to viruses is critical for the control of virus disease in fields. Over the last several decades, the outstanding outcomes of extensive research have been achieved on comprehension of plant immunity to viruses. Although most dominant R genes have been used as natural resistance genes, recessive resistance genes have been deployed in several crops as another efficient strategy to control viruses. In addition, RNA interference also regulates plant immunity and contribute a very efficient antiviral system at the nucleic acid level. This review aims at describing virus disease on crops and summarizes current resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, we will discuss the current biotechnological approaches to contr",김남연,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108287444
식물 RNA 바이러스의 진화와 병저항성 극복 기작,"Plant RNA viruses are one of the most destructive pathogens that cause a significant loss in crop production worldwide. They have evolved with high genetic diversity and adaptability due to the short replication cycle and high mutation rate during genome replication, which are characteristics of RNA viruses. Plant RNA viruses exist as quasispecies with high genetic diversity; thereby, a rapid population transition with new fitness can occur due to selective pressure resulting from environmental changes. Plant resistance can act as selective pressure and affect the fitness of the virus, which may lead to the emergence of resistance-breaking variants. In this paper, we introduced the evolutionary perspectives of plant RNA viruses and the driving forces in their evolution. Based on this, we discussed the mechanism of the emergence of variant viruses that overcome plant resistance. In addition, strategies for deploying plant resistance to viral diseases and improving resis- tance durability were discussed.",김명휘(Myung-Hwi Kim),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100066719
환경사회학의 관점에서 본 유전자조작식품 ( GMO ) 의 사회상 연구,"The objectives of this study were to review various aspects of society on Genetically Modified Organism(GMO) in the view point of environmental sociology. There were many assertions related to GMO, and application of biotechnology. Some people assert GMO as harmful to human health, and some people as not harmful, however, there were no proven evidences to report. Through the literature review, this study intended; 1) to identify the present condition of GMO, 2) to weigh the pros against cons of views on GMO, 3) to study an aspect of society on GMO, and 4) to assert its necessity to mark GMO or not, because citizens have a rights to know natural or GMO. Based on the conclusions of this study, following recommendations were offered: 1) To review continually the GMO in the view point of environmental sociology especially in the areas of food safety, biosafety, trade, and public research investment, and 2) further detailed studies of GMO may necessary to ensure safety to human health and environment.",임형백(Hyung Baek Lim),2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2115284
"Agarose gel, Polyacrylamide gel, EnhanceIT gel의 전기영동법을 이용한 PCR 증폭 산물의 비교 분석","Agarose gel and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are methods for the analysis of DNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis is used for macromolecular nucleic acids whereas polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is for small molecular nucleic acids. Agarose gel electrophoresis is widely used for the analysis of PCR products. However, it is difficult to differentiate each amplicon product with similar size of products. We added EnhanceIT Polymer Solution which was developed to make up for the weak points when preparing polyacrylamide gel. In this study, we compared the efficiency of analysis for DNA marker and small amplicon products from 3 different gels (agarose gel, polyacrylamide gel and EnhanceIT gel). As a result, EnhanceIT gel has the highest resolution for the analysis of small size DNA.",김선아,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105271420
원예치료가 치매노인의 손 기능에 미치는 영향,"In order to examine the effect of horticultural therapy on hand function of demented elders, the present study applied horticultural therapy to demented elders who were able to use both of their hands. The horticultural therapy program (HTP) included various works in need of delicate hand motions for strengthening the demented elders’ hand function. Hand function was evaluated in terms of pinch and grip. The pinch of the right hand was changed from 2.90 ㎏ pre-HTP to 3.97 ㎏ post-HTP (p<0.05), and that of the left hand was changed from 3.06 ㎏ to 3.99 ㎏ (p<0.05). This shows that pinch was strengthened significantly after the horticultural therapy. The grip of the right hand was changed from 6.02 ㎏ pre-HTP to 7.40 ㎏ post-HTP, and that of the left hand was changed from 5.32 ㎏ to 6.85 ㎏. This shows that grip was strengthened little by little after the horticultural therapy but the change was not significant. Therefore, if demented elders continue to have various types of hand works moderate to them, such works will be effective not only in maintaining their hand function but also in strengthening it further.",윤숙영(Suk-Young Yun),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107996913
限界生産力設의 理論的 檢討,"The marginal productivity theory has been a generally accepted principle among contempory economists. This theory, however, is now challenged with criticisms mainly raised by the Italo-Cambridge Shool, such as Joan Robinson, Nicholas Kaldor, Piero Sraffa and others. This thesis consists the following three parts.
(1) To review the history of the maginal productivity theories.
(2) To examine the theoretical relationship between the classical marginal productivity theory, that was mainly developed by F.H. Wicksteed, and the modern marginal productivity theory which has been developed in connection with Euler's Theorem.
(3) To examine the criticisms raised by the Italo-Cambridge School.
In the writer's opinion, the marginal productivity theory seems to be unable to withstand against the criticisms raised by Italo-Cambridge School, and accordingly the marginal productivity theory, which has so far been generally accepted principle among contemporary economists, shouled be fundamentally re-examined.",朱宗桓,1976,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107974732
농경지 내 생태계교란식물의 분포,"Invasive alien species (IAS) can affect agricultural ecosystem negatively and critically. The geographical distributions of nine IAS plants in Korean orchards and uplands were investigated. Ambrosia artemisiifolia distributed widely in Korean peninsula and Ambrosia trifida distributed intensively in Gyeonggi-do. Aster pilosus distributed in Gyeonggi-Gangwon region and Lactuca scariola distributed linear region from the north-western to south-eastern part of Korea. Hypochaeris radicata distributed mainly in Jeju-do and Solanum carolinense distributed in eastern Gyeonggi-do. Rumex acetosella and Sicyos angulatus sporadically occurred in Korean croplands and Eupatorium rugosum was found in one region only. The distribution of IAS plants in croplands was very similar to that in non-croplands suggesting that ecological position of arable lands is not different from that of non-arable lands. Therefore, IAS plants in the croplands should be managed for not only prevention of yield reduction, but also protection or maintenance of original ecosystem. Development of management methods apposite to current Korean status are required to control IAS plants in croplands.",김진원,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76225621
도보여행길과 연계한 농촌마을 활성화 방안에 관한 연구,"In recent years, the number of walking-tourists who visit Jeju olle trail are increasing every year and the ripple effect is a rapid change on the roles and leadership of local people in rural villages. The reason for the change is that most Jeju Olle Trails cuts through the rural village in Jeju island. However, most of travelers just walked along the trails, no one was interested about villages along the Olle roads. For these reasons, many rural villages would not get any benefits such as non-farm income, sales profit and also can not activate the facility of village and infrastructure. Therefore, we study on Revitalization Method for rural villages through the Analysis of characteristics of tourist in Jeju Olle Trails and a field survey research too. In this process, we investigated the status and characteristics of the rural villages of Jeju island in the first step. Then, we considered the distinct characteristics and factors for improving of the 10 places with site investigation where were recommended by Jeju Olle Corporation and Jeju Agricultural Technology Center in second step. Lastly, we arranged the resident's requirement and result of survey and interview with leaders of rural village. As a result, we suggest the activation methods for residents and leaders of rural area and this study is also expected to help management of rural villages and also is an important study to improve importance of utilizing of more people visiting in Jeju Olle Trails.",임창수,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82692916

아미노산 첨가에 따른 느타리 균사체 생장 및 laccase 활성 비교,"In this study, we aimed to compare the mycelial growth of Pleurotus ostreatus after medium supplementation with various amino acids at different concentrations to select the optimal medium nutrient composition for mycelial growth. The mycelial growth of P. ostreatus was investigated after adding four amino acids (tryptophan, threonine, methionine, and lysine) at 0.5% or 1% to the medium.The rate of P. ostreatus mycelial growthwas faster in the potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium supplemented with threonine at 0.5% or 1% than that of the control, whereas it was inhibited by tryptophan treatment.
Supplementation of sawdust mediumwith all amino acids, except tryptophan, at 0.5% did not alter the mycelial growth, compared to the controls. However, addition of any amino acid to sawdust medium at a higher concentration (1%) inhibited the mycelial growth. The laccase acitivity of P. ostreatus mycelium cultured in PDA medium was the highest when threonine was added, and the lowest when tryptophane was added, consistent with the results of the mycelial growth. Therefore, the addition of threonine, methionine, or lysine to PDA medium at a concentration of 0.5-1%was effective for increasing the mycelial growth of P. ostreatus; however, it inhibited mycelial growth insawdust medium, suggesting that the effects of amino acids dependedon the medium nutrient composition.",최성주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3063879
