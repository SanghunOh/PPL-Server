빅데이터 분석을 활용한 코로나19 전후 다이어트 인식 및 트렌드 연구,"This study aimed to explore consumer perceptions and trends by deriving major keywords for diet before (2019) and after (2021) COVID-19 based on big data. To achieve this, data were collected by social media and text mining. In addition, semantic network, network visualization, and sentiment analyses were conducted. Text mining analysis showed keywords with the highest frequencies before and after COVID-19 were exercise, diet, start, health, and effect. TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) analysis showed keywords with high scores before COVID-19 were lunch boxes, diary, dinner, efficacy, food, and summer and that dance, sales, and products appeared only before COVID-19. On the other hand, TF-IDF after COVID-19 showed recommendations, snacks, delicious, food, salad, care, making, and weight were used more frequently and that new words such as shake, cooking, and protein featured more after COVID-19. After COVID-19, consumers showed more interest in snacks and food that can be made and eaten rather than dietary supplements. Semantic network analysis showed that before COVID-19, preparation, management, health, and summer had high frequencies, whereas after COVID-19, keywords such as maintenance, control, weight, management, and weight loss appeared. These findings show that the purpose of diet before COVID-19 was to improve health and summer preparation, but that after COVID-19, consumer focus changed to weight loss and maintenance. The findings of this study provide fundamental data for in-depth marketing and consumer research studies for diet-related industries and academia.",이은정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76059741

The study also sought to confirm the factors related to depression and their association with diet. Raw data from the 2016 and 2018 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) were used. The subjects of the study were adults, divided by age into YA (under 40 years), MA (between 40 to 65 years), and LA (over 65 years) groups. Among them, patients diagnosed with depression by a physician or with a patient health questionnaire-9 score of 10 or above were assigned to the depression group. Other subjects of the same gender and age were selected as the normal group using the Propensity Score Matching method. Accordingly, the final subjects for analysis comprised 286 in the YA, 462 in the MA, and 528 in the LA groups. A decision tree analysis was used to predict the factors influencing depression as follows: In the YA group, the factors were lifetime cigarette smoking; BMI distribution and fiber intake; breakfast companion. In the MA group, they were income level; BMI distribution, walking, lifetime cigarette smoking, vitamin B2 intake; Niacin intake, percent of fat intake, and fiber intake. In the LA group, the factors were Income level; Food security status, walking, and nutrition label recognition; Lifetime cigarette smoking, walking, breakfast companion, and fiber intake. This study confirmed that dietary factors, which had not emerged as being of significance thus far, should be included in the prevention and appropriate management of depression.",이수진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108640205
액상과당의 영양대사학적 특성과 건강에 미치는 영향,"High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is a liquid sweetener of glucose-fructose monomer mixture, commonly known as replacement for sucrose (table sugar). HFCS was first applied to food companies in the early 1970s ever since there was a huge increase of its use worldwide, especially in beverage and processed food. While the metabolic and nutritional characteristics of HFCS have been widely studied, only recently has the role of HFCS in metabolic syndrome and other health issues emerged. Studies in many laboratories worldwide have built the evidence that excessive consumption of HFCS plays a crucial role in insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, and kidney disease. This manuscript reviews the history, manufacturing process, and nutritional and metabolic traits of HFCS and describes its involvement in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndromes and obesity.","김혜미,정정호,고광웅",2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99966659

"초등학교 아동의 성장 마인드셋, 고정 마인드셋과 그릿(Grit)의 관계에서 회복탄력성의 매개효과","This research is to empirically verify how elementary school students’ growth mindset, fixed mindset and resilience make an impact on grit. The survey has been conducted utilizing a growth mindset, fixed mindset and resilience through grit scale from 204 elementary school students at 5th and 6th grades in Northern Seoul, and the hypothesis of the research has been verified accordingly. The results have shown that the high growth mindset brings the high the level of resilience and grit. In contrast, the writer has observed the high fixed mindset does the low level of resilience and grit. Besides, the study shows that there is no direct correlation between the growth mindset and the grit, whereas, the full mediating effect has been shown through resilience. On the other hand, the fixed mindset not only directly affects the grit, but also shows a partial mediating effect through resilience. The outcome shows that when we establish the engagement strategies for improving grit for elementary students, the fixed mindset adjustment should be preceded before a full-scale exercise on the growth mindset.

"성인 남녀의 음주 상태와 채식, 육식 식사패턴의 추이 및 관련성 분석: 2007～2018년 국민건강영양조사 자료를 이용하여","This study aimed to examine secular trends in alcohol consumption status and data-driven dietary patterns and investigate sex-specific associations between alcohol consumption status and dietary patterns in Korean men and women. The data of 43,175 adults (17,721 men and 25,454 women) aged 19 to 64 years extracted from Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys conducted between 2007 and 2018 were subjected to factor analysis, and two types of dietary patterns were identified; a “vegetable dietary pattern” and a “meat dietary pattern”. Analyses of the secular trends of these dietary patterns and alcohol consumption status revealed a significant increase in the meat dietary pattern and alcohol drinking in women (P<0.001). On the other hand, in men, a significant decrease in alcohol drinking (P<0.001) and the vegetable dietary pattern (P<0.05) and a significant increase in the meat dietary pattern (P<0.001) were observed. Multiple association analyses showed that the meat dietary pattern was positively associated with alcohol consumption in men and women (P<0.001) and that the vegetable dietary pattern was inversely associated with alcohol consumption in men (P<0.001). Male and female heavy drinkers showed high and similar factor scores for the meat dietary pattern.

디카페인 커피 원두의 향기성분 변화,"In this study, we wanted to understand the impact of different decaffeination processes on aroma compounds of coffee. Therefore, we analyzed differences in physical characteristics and volatile aroma compounds profiles of regular coffee (RC), Swiss water process decaffeinated coffee (SWDC), and supercritical CO2 decaffeinated coffee (SCDC) after roasting the coffee beans. The electronic nose analysis identified RC and SCDC as different groups which indicates that these groups volatile aroma compound compositions were different.
The principal component analysis of volatile compound patterns identified using an electronic nose indicated that there was a large difference in volatile compounds between RC, which was not decaffeinated, and both decaffeinated SWDC and SCDC. The major aroma compounds of RC, SWDC and SCDC were propan-2-one and hexan-2-one which are ketone, and hexanal and (E)-2- pentenal which are aldehyde and 3-methyl-1-butanol which is an alcohol. After roasting, the composition of major volatile compounds appearing in the beans was similar, but the relative odor intensity was different. We identified 28 volatile aroma compounds from RC, SWDC, and SCDC using headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC/MS), and analyzed 10 major compounds that were present in high abundance, including furfural, 2-furanmethanol, 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, and 2-ethyl-3-methylpyrazine.",이진영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82762577

As a result of an analysis for fusel alcohol, high qualified types of alcohol including 3-methylbutanol, 2-methylbutanol, iso-butanol, and 1-propanol were detected from all Scotch whiskys, America whiskys, and Canadian whiskys. In particular, the proportional sum of 3-methylbutanol and 2-methylbutanol, and the sum of 3-methylbutanol and 2-methylbutanol/iso-butanol were regarded as core factors to determine each type of whisky. Acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, and acetic acid increased as maturation and storage period became longer. As a result of the fatty acid and fatty acid ethyl ester analysis, the major fatty acids were dodecanoic acid and decanoic acid, both with detection of octanoic acid and hexanoic acid. However, dodecanoic acid, decanoic acid, and octanoic acid were lower than the detectable limit in American and Canadian whiskys, showing a unique phenomenon that hexanoic acid was detected only in very small amounts. Malt Scotch whisky showed higher significance than blended Scotch whisky, making it possible to classify types of whisky. Fatty acid ethyl ester contents showed significance with fatty acid either. In addition, changes in the whiskys based on maturation period were confirmed via proportions of fatty acids and fatty acid ethyl esters.
