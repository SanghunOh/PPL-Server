Against this backdrop, Japan has announced a plan to release radioactive water to the sea from 2023. In the case of Korea, it is adjacent to the area to be discharged, so there are concerns about securing the safety of marine products. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the change in perception and impact of marine product consumers due to the discharge of contaminated water and to study appropriate countermeasures when discharging contaminated water from nuclear power plants.
In this study, the current status of radioactive contaminated water discharge in Japan was summarized, and a survey was conducted on the change in the consumption perception of marine products according to the discharge of contaminated water to analyze the factors affecting the consumption change of domestic consumers.
According to the survey, 85.3% of the respondents said that it will affect the purchase of domestic marine products if Japan starts discharging contaminated water from nuclear power plants. Moreover, 85.5% of the respondents said it will affect the purchase of imported marine products.",윤유진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108183032
"악성 민원에 의한 공공기관 직원들의 감정노동, 회복탄력성, 사회적 지지, 삶의 질의 구조적 관계","Abstract This study examines the impact of malicious complaints on the life of employees in local government and the mediating effect of resilience and social support. A survey was conducted in April 2022 targeting 325 employees working in B metropolitan city, and the structural equation model was used for analyzing the survey data. The conclusions of this study are as follows. First, malicious complaints had a positive effect on emotional labor of the employees, and emotional labor did not directly affect the quality of life of them. Second, resilience and social support had a mediating effect on emotional labor and quality of life of the employees. In other words, emotional labor did not have a direct effect on the quality of life, but it was found that it was a powerful variable that affected th quality of life through self-regulation ability, interpersonal relationships, positivity, superior support, and peer support. Third, in the relationship between emotional labor, resilience, social support, and quality of life, there was a moderating effect among the three groups (Official, Indefinite contract worker, and Accredited police). Statistically significant differences were found in the effect of emotional labor on resilience and social support, and of resilience on quality of life.",양승은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102122968
기후변화가 마로해의 김 양식에 미치는 영향 및 대응방안,"Global warming affects critical natural resources, one of which is the oceans that occupy 70% of the total cover of the earth. In other words, ocean warming is a subset of global warming which needs to be addressed urgently. Purple laver (pyropia spp.) is one of the most vulnerable items to climate change although it is a major export product of Korean fisheries. The purpose of this study is to analyze the causality of how climate change caused by global warming affects the increase or decrease of PLP (purple laver production). The target area for analysis was set to Maro-hae between Jindo-gun and Haenam-gun. We selected marine environmental factors and meteorologic factors that could affect PLP as variables, as well as co-integration tests to determine long-term balance, and the Granger causticity tests. As a result, PLP and marine environmental factors WT (water temperature), pH, and DO confirmed that long-term equilibrium relationships were established, respectively. However, there is only causality with WT and it is confirmed that there is only a correlation between pH and DO (dissolved oxygen). There was no long-term equilibrium relationship between PLP and HDD (heating degree days) and there is a causal effect that HDD affects PLP; however, it was less clear than that of WT. The relationship between PLP and RF (rainfall), WS (wind speed), SS (percentage of sunshine), and FF (farm facilities) was all balanced in the long term, and causality exists. Based on the results of the analysis, policy proposals were made.",김태형 ( Tae-hyung Kim ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108489768
폐쇄시스템 내에서 죽은 산호골격이 수질과 고착성 연체동물에 미치는 영향,"Recently, for the purpose of constructing artificial ecosystem, the public aquarium and experimental mesocosm systems are receiving attention. To design and establish an aquarium and mesocosm system, there is need of several materials for simulating the environment, such as sediments, rocks, and plants. Expecially for sessile mollusks, there must be proper materials to which sessile invertebrates can adhere. Nowadays, many aquariums and mesocosm systems are using dead coral skeletons for sessile mollusks. This study was proceeded to have data on the effect of dead coral skeletons on water qualities with the experiment on the environmental factors. For this purpose, I made glass tank for experiment, chose two types of dead coral skeletons imported from the Indonesia and observed the change of water qualities and decomposition efficiency of TAN (total ammonia-nitrogen), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-). As a result, the lager the surface area was, the more TAN, nitrite and nitrate decomposition rate increased. In addition, coral skeletons covered with crustose algae and bacteria in the tank showed faster TAN, nitrite and nitrate removal rate and stabilization. Accordingly, this experiment suggested that dead coral skeletons could be used as a sub filter for the closed system as well as an adhering plate",이남현,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101979986
낙동강 하구 해양환경 및 기상 요인이 김(Porphyre yezoensis) 생산량 변화에 미치는 영향,"To understand the effects of marine environmental and meteorological parameters on laver Porphyra yezoensis production at Nakdong River Estuary, we analyzed marine environmental (water temperature, salinity, nutrients, etc.) and meteorological properties (air temperature, wind speed, precipitation, sunshine hours) with yearly and monthly variations in laver production over 10 years (2003-2013). Air and water temperature, wind speed, sunshine hours and precipitation were major factors affecting yearly variability in laver production at the Nakdong River Estuary. Lower air and water temperatures together with higher levels of nutrients and sunshine and stronger wind speeds resulted in higher laver harvests. Salinity and nitrogen did not show clear correlations with laver production, mainly due to the plentiful supply of nitrogen from river discharge and the low frequency of environmental measurements,which resulted in low statistical confidence. However, environmental factors affecting monthly laver production were related to the life cycle (culturing stage) of Porphyra yezoensis and were somewhat different from factors affecting annual laver production. In November, a young laver needs lower water temperatures for rapid growth, while a mature laver needs much stronger winds and more sunshine, as well as lower temperatures for massive production and effective photosynthesis, mostly in December and January. However, in spring (March), more stable environments with fewer fluctuations in air temperature are needed to sustain the production of newly deployed culture-nets (2nd time culture). These results indicate that rapid changes in weather and marine environments caused by global climate change will negatively affect laver production and, thus, to sustain the yield of and predict future variability in laver production at the Nakdong River estuary, environmental variation around laver culturing farms needs to be monitored with high resolution in space and time.",권정노 ( Jung No Kwon ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107387731

옥시벤존(Benzophenone-3)이 돌돔(Oplegnathus fasciatus)의 배 발생 과정에 미치는 영향,"Oxybenzone (Benzophenone-3; BP-3) is a compound used in sunscreens and enters the oceans due to improper disposal. It is known to disrupt the endocrine signaling in marine organisms, leading to immune and reproductive abnormalities in corals, shellfish and fishes. In this study, we investigated the effects of different concentrations of BP-3 (0, 10, 100 and 1,000 μg/L) on the fertilized eggs and hatched larvae of Oplegnathus fasciatus. The morphological changes and hatching and survival rates during embryo development were assessed. In addition, the levels of triiodothyronine (T3) were also measured. The hatched larvae exposed to BP-3 at concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/L for 24 h displayed malformation of the tail. After 36 h of exposure to BP-3, spinal deformity was observed at all tested concentrations. The hatching rate was significantly low when exposed to 100 μg/L of BP-3. A high levels of T3 was observed when the larvae were exposed to BP-3 at a concentration of 1,000 μg/L for 96 h (the end of the experiment).
This may be related to increased size of larvae at 1,000 μg/L BP-3. In conclusion, our results suggested that BP-3 may interfere with embryo development, resulting in a reduction in hatching rate and malformation of larvae.",송미해,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107774704
우리나라 서해 근해 해저 쓰레기 분포 및 조성,"Distribution and composition of the seabed litters in the exclusive economic zone of the West Sea of South Korea including 18 sea-blocks were investigated using a bottom trawl gear of the R/V Tamgtu 20 (National Institute of Fisheries Science) from 24th April 2011 to 4th May 2012.

알파-피넨(alpha-pinene)이 함유된 스카티카증 치료용 나노복합체 개발 및 Miamiensis avidus에 대한 살충 효과,"Alpha-pinene is an organic compound that possesses antibiotic and anti-parasitic activities. In this study, we developed a layered nanocomposite to combat against Miamiensis avidus which causes scuticociliatosis in the olive flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. We used a solid-solid reaction to develop the layered nanocomposite, incorporating-pinene (C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>) into organically modified montmorillonite. We used cetyltrimethylammonium cations as the interlayered modifier for the adsorption of hydrophobic pinene molecules. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the nanocomposite structure showed that the basal spacing increased from 9.6 A to 30.4 A. Interestingly, the fraction of α-pinene released remained constant for a long period of time (228 h) due to the layered nature of the nanocomposite. Additionally, optical microscopic images of the treated scuticociliatids revealed that their cells were lysed, and this effect increased with the increasing concertration of α-pinene. Histopathological assessment of α-pinene nanocomposite-treated olive flounder gills revealed no significant morphological changes, even at the highest concentration of the α-pinene. The nanocomposite has several advantages, including easy handling, high solubility, low toxicity, and the easy formulation of granules or powder, which improve the pesticidal activity of α-pinene. Collectively, our results suggest that α-pinene nanocomposite may be a useful treatment against scuticociliatosis.",정철연 ( Chul-yeon Jung ),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107280820
