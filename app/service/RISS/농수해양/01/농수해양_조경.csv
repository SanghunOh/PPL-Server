Nevertheless, a meditation space is not just a place concept but a forest environment element responsible for the healing function of a forest, i.e., a place containing healing factors, and can be an essential clue to the healing mechanism. Therefore, to determine whether a healing forest meditation space is suitable for meditation, this study selected the attribute items of the meditation space using the Delphi expert survey and then surveyed the user satisfaction of the healing forest meditation space using the IPA (Importance Performance Analysis) technique. The survey was conducted from August to November 2022, targeting 315 adults who used the forest meditation space at the National Center for Forest Therapy, the Saneum Healing Forest, and the Jathyanggi Pureunsup Arboretum in Gyeonggi Province. The result of the IPA analysis showed the average satisfaction with the forest meditation space was relatively high at 4.33 points on a 5-point Likert scale (4.33 points for the National Center for Forest Therapy, 4.34 points for the Saneum Healing Forest, and 4.37 points for the Jathyanggi Pureunsup Arboretum), indicating that the three healing forest meditation spaces were suitable for forest meditation. Satisfaction with the “Sounds of nature” was high in all three forests. On the other hand, all three forests showed a relatively low satisfaction with “Quietness,” indicating it to be a priority problem to be addressed. Also, an open-ended questionnaire survey showed that the mediation space’s natural elements, such as natural sounds, scenery, air, forest spaces, and scents, had a higher positive impact on meditation satisfaction than artificial elements, such as facilities. Therefore, it is essential to secure sound resources such as the sound of water and birds around the meditation space, and it is also necessary to consider ways to create a meditation forest in an independent area to avoid encounters with visitors and allow only participants in the forest healing meditation program to enter to increase satisfaction with forest meditation.",정경미,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101267714
청년들의 지방이주와 정주지속을 위한 장소정체성 연구†,"Recently, there has been an increasing interest in the migration of young people to local areas. These young people are discovering and reinterpreting local resources to open local businesses while generating new value in local activities and businesses. This study was initiated with the recognition that fundamental solutions are needed for these young people to settle and sustain residence in the local area. Edward Relph stated that 'place' is a fundamental attribute that influences human existence in the world and is the source of stability and identity formation for individuals. This is deeply related to the psychology of young people who have migrated to local areas. These young people accept the unfamiliar 'space' as a 'place' to form stability and personal identity. Therefore, this study utilized PhotoVoice methodology to examine the process and key factors of place identity formation among migrant youths. As a result, the study identified factors that enable young people to settle in local areas and sustain residence while recognizing elements the local government should focus on to support and address the influx of young people. The results of this study can serve as a foundation for addressing the declining population in local areas through the formation of a relationship population and spur the inflow of young people to local cities in the future.",이창현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108736955
인공지능을 활용한 경관 지각반응 예측모델 개발 가능성 기초연구† - 머신러닝 기법을 중심으로 -,"The recent surge of IT and data acquisition is shifting the paradigm in all aspects of life, and these advances are also affecting academic fields. Research topics and methods are being improved through academic exchange and connections. In particular, data-based research methods are employed in various academic fields, including landscape architecture, where continuous research is needed. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the possibility of developing a landscape preference evaluation and prediction model using machine learning, a branch of Artificial Intelligence, reflecting the current situation. To achieve the goal of this study, machine learning techniques were applied to the landscaping field to build a landscape preference evaluation and prediction model to verify the simulation accuracy of the model. For this, wind power facility landscape images, recently attracting attention as a renewable energy source, were selected as the research objects. For analysis, images of the wind power facility landscapes were collected using web crawling techniques, and an analysis dataset was built. Orange version 3.33, a program from the University of Ljubljana was used for machine learning analysis to derive a prediction model with excellent performance. IA model that integrates the evaluation criteria of machine learning and a separate model structure for the evaluation criteria were used to generate a model using kNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network algorithms suitable for machine learning classification models. The performance evaluation of the generated models was conducted to derive the most suitable prediction model. The prediction model derived in this study separately evaluates three evaluation criteria, including classification by type of landscape, classification by distance between landscape and target, and classification by preference, and then synthesizes and predicts results. As a result of the study, a prediction model with a high accuracy of 0.986 for the evaluation criterion according to the type of landscape, 0.973 for the evaluation criterion according to the distance, and 0.952 for the evaluation criterion according to the preference was developed, and it can be seen that the verification process through the evaluation of data prediction results exceeds the required performance value of the model. As an experimental attempt to investigate the possibility of developing a prediction model using machine learning in landscape-related research, this study was able to confirm the possibility of creating a high-performance prediction model by building a data set through the collection and refinement of image data and subsequently utilizing it in landscape-related research fields. Based on the results, implications, and limitations of this study, it is believed that it is possible to develop various types of landscape prediction models, including wind power facility natural, and cultural landscapes. Machine learning techniques can be more useful and valuable in the field of landscape architecture by exploring and applying research methods appropriate to the topic, reducing the time of data classification through the study of a model that classifies images according to landscape types or analyzing the importance of landscape planning factors through the analysis of landscape prediction factors using machine learning.",김진표,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103060893
모바일 데이터를 활용한 도시공원 이용자 핫스팟 분석† - 서울 성동구 공원을 대상으로 -,"This study investigated the distribution of users in urban parks to overcome the limitations of existing research, which made it difficult to determine where data came was collected. It aimed to provide implications for park planning and management based on user distribution using mobile signal data. Five urban parks in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, with various physical characteristics, were selected. Mobile signal data provided by the Seoul Big Data Campus was used to identify the distribution of user inflow through hot spot analysis per park. The relationship between urban context and park influence area was derived. Seoul Forest (P1) and Seongsu Park (P3), which have a high proportion of commercial spaces around the park, showed wider user hotspots compared to Eungbong Park (P2), Dokseodang Park (P4), and Daehyunsan Park (P5), which were located in residential areas. Parks with a significant presence of commercial spaces had a broader influence, while parks with larger sizes and gentle slopes exhibited wider influence areas. This study proposed a novel data-based approach to urban park planning and management based on the inflow distribution of park users. Through this research, valuable insights were derived that could be utilized for urban park planning and management, aiming to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of park utilization.",조민균,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635010
지리산 구상나무림의 종조성 및 식생구조,"This study set up 49 survey areas with an area of about 400 square meters in Abies koreana natural habitat to identify the species composition and vegetation structure of the A. koreana forest in the Mt. Jiri Nation Park, conducted field surveys using phytosociological methods, and performed the cluster analysis using the Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) and Table manipulation. Subsequently, species composition analysis using the importance value, species diversity analysis, DBH analysis, sapling analysis, and similarity analysis was conducted by each cluster type. The cluster analysis classified the A. koreana forest in Mt. Jiri into five clusters, A, B, C, D, and E. The forest was divided into two clusters, Magnolia sieboldii-Dryopteris rassirhizoma-Sasa borealis and Betula ermanii-Solidago virgaurea-Calamagrostis arundinacea. The former was classified as type A and B by Cornus controversa-Hydrangea macrophylla, and the latter was classified as type E, a typical community, and a Sorbus commixta-Rhododendron mucronulatum cluster. And the S. commixta-R. mucronulatum cluster was divided into C type and D type by Picea jezoensis-Ligularia fischeri and Ainsliaea acerifolia. Through vegetation analysis, the importance value of A. koreana, Quercus mongolica, Acer pseudosieboldianum, Fraxinus sieboldiana, and B. ermanii was highly expressed in the A. koreana forest in Mt. Jiri. Regarding species diversity, the results were similar to those reported in other studies of A. koreana forests in Mt. Jiri. The analysis of diameter at breast height (DBH) showed that A. koreana dominated all layers, and the growth of saplings was also good, indicating that the dominance of A. koreana is expected to continue for a while. However, when considering the value of biodiversity that is expected to increase and threats caused by climate change, systematic preservation and management are required to respond to various threats based on continuous monitoring.",이진수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103620179
요가와 명상 중심의 산림치유 프로그램이 성인의 기분상태와 스트레스 반응에 미치는 효과,"The purpose of this study is to verify the effects of yoga and meditation-focused forest healing programs on profiles of mood states and stress reactions of adults. We tested 17 adults who agreed to participate in the experiments that were conducted for 2 nights and 3 days between September 8 to 10, 2017 in the healing forest located at Hongcheon-gun, Gangwon-do. The test used the simplified version of the inventory for the profile of mood states (K-POMS-B: Korean version of Profile of Mood States-Brief) and the stress response inventory as the measuring tools. For data analysis, we examined the differences in the profile of mood states and stress response of subjects before and after participation in the program through the paired T-tests with the SPSS 24.0 program. The analysis of the impact of the yoga and meditation-focused forest healing program on the profile of mood states of the test subjects showed the statistically significant reduction of the total score of the profile of mood states. Although the vigor among sub-level inventories increased, it was not statistically significant. But the tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion showed a statistically significant reduction. The analysis of the impact of the yoga and meditation-focused forest healing program on the stress response of the test subjects showed a statistically significant reduction. Among sub-level inventories, the tension, somatization, anger, depression, fatigue, and frustration showed a statistically significant reduction, but the aggressiveness did not.

First, the status of landscape architecture in cultural heritage, including natural monuments and scenic sites, must be defined.
If possible, careful consideration should be given to establish the natural monuments law and scenic sites law, respectively, related to landscape architecture. Second, natural heritage must be preserved by focusing on ""space"" to include cultural artifacts and landscapes that may be missing through the method of ""object"" focused protection. Institutionally, the scope of work should be clearly shared by reviewing the redundancy and interrelationship of related laws. Third, in order to protect and manage natural heritage, a department that is wholly responsible for landscape architecture should be established independently at the Cultural Heritage Administration. Fourth, the landscape architecture field should be specified as the requirements for the commissioner of commission at the Cultural Heritage Protection Act.

유형별 녹지 시뮬레이션을 통한 아파트 단지 내 도시열섬현상 저감효과 분석†,"The purpose of this study is to propose effective scenarios for green areas in apartment complexes that can improve the connection between green spaces considering wind flow, thermal comfort, and mitigation of the urban heat island effect. The study site was an apartment complex in Godeok-dong, Gangdong-gu, Seoul, Korea. The site selection was based on comparing temperatures and discomfort index data collected from June to August 2020. Initially, the thermal and wind environment of the current site was analyzed. Based on the findings, three scenarios were proposed, taking into account both green patches and corridor elements: Scenario 1 (green patch), Scenario 2 (green corridor), and Scenario 3 (green patch & corridor). Subsequently, each scenario's wind speed, wind flow, and thermal comfort were analyzed using ENVI-met to compare their effectiveness in mitigating the urban heat island effect. The study results demonstrated that green patches contributed to increased wind speed and improved wind flow, leading to a reduction of 31..20% in the predicted mean vote (PMV) and 68.59% in the predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PET). On the other hand, green corridors facilitated the connection of wind paths and further increased wind speed compared to green patches. They proved to be more effective than green patches in mitigating the urban heat island, resulting in a reduction of 92.47% in PMV and 90.14% in PET. The combination of green patches and green corridors demonstrated the greatest increase in wind speed and strong connectivity within the apartment complex, resulting in a reduction of 95.75% in PMV and 95.35% in PET. However, patches in narrow areas were found to be more effective in improving thermal comfort than green corridors. Therefore, to effectively mitigate the urban heat island effect, enhancing green areas by incorporating green corridors in conjunction with green patches is recommended. This study can serve as fundamental data for planning green areas to mitigate future urban heat island effects in apartment complexes. Additionally, it can be considered a method to improve urban resilience in response to the challenges posed by the urban heat island effect.",지은주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108249706

The ecological restoration project was executed with the forest of P. densiflora in 2012-2013. In April 2018, we collected soil samples from each site and measured the height and the diameter at breach height (DBH) of P. densiflora. Although there was no significant change of soil pH compared to the early stage of restoration (one year after the project), it was high in Ihwaryeong, and Beoljae with values of 7.7 and 6.4, respectively. Also, the organic matter decreased by 70-80%, and the available phosphorus (P) was unchanged in three restoration sites. The decreased organic matter can be attributed to restriction of inflow and thus decomposition of litter in the early stage after the restoration. The tree height growth rate (m yr-1) of P. densiflora in Yuksimnyeong was the highest at 1.02, followed by Beolja at 0.75 and Ihwaryeong at 0.17. The height growth rate showed negative relationships with soil pH and cations, including Na and Ca concentrations and a positive relationship with available phosphate. The low growth rate in the Ihwaryeong site, in particular, might result from the poor nutrient availability due to high soil pH and the decrease in water absorption into the root due to high Na and Ca concentrations. The substantial reduction of organic matter after five years indicates that the need for soil improvement using chemical fertilizer and biochar.",한승현,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103121147

Jeju Olle Trail type based on the biotope type, major land use, vegetation status around Olle Trail and roads were divided into 12 types. Based on the type of ecological tourism resource classification, the Jeju Olle-gil walking tourism resource classification was divided into seven types of natural resources and seven types of humanities resources, and each resource was characterized by Geotope, Biotope, and Anthropopope, just like the landscape ecology system. Geotope resources are strong in landscape characteristics such as coast and beach, rocks, bedrocks, waterfalls, geology and Jusangjeolli Cliff, Oreum and craters, water resources, and landscape viewpoints. The Biotope resources showed strong ecological characteristics due to large tree and protected tree, Gotjawal, forest road and vegetation communities, biological habitat, vegetation landscape view point. Antropotope include Culture of Jeju Haenyeo and traditional culture, potting and lighthouses, experience facilities, temples and churches, military and beacon facilities, other historical and cultural facilities, and cultural landscape views. Jeju Olle Trail The representative resources for each type of Jeju Olle Trail are coastal, Oreum, Gotjawal, field and Stonewall Fencing farming land, Jeju Village and Stone wall of Jeju. In order to learn about the components and various functions of the resources representing the Olle Trail's ecological culture, the landscape ecological technique was interpreted. Looking at the ecological and cultural characteristics of coastal, the coast includes black basalt rocks, coastal vegetation, coastal grasslands, coastal rock vegetation, winter migratory birds and Jeju haenyeo. Oreum is a unique volcanic topography, which includes circular and oval mountain bodies, oreum vegetation, crater wetlands, the origin and legend of the name of Oreum, the legend of the name of Oreum, the culture of grazing horses, the use of military purposes, the object of folk belief, and the view from the summit.

‘민간정원’의 현황 및 특성 분석,"`Private Garden', is a legal concept that encourages the opening of private gardens to the public. Twenty-five private gardens have registered with the Forest Service since the 2015 policy was enacted. Although it is a positive system in terms of spreading and encouraging garden culture, the exact nature, role, and designation requirements have not been fully discussed. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of 25 private gardens in Korea. The results of the study noted that the southern region occupied a large part of the geographical distribution of the private gardens, which is due to the natural and climatic conditions, the policies of the local governments, and the discretion of public officials. In addition, the gardens are almost all made up of modern gardens; there was only one house garden from the Joseon Dynasty. The owners of the gardens range from their 50s to 80s in age. The gardens were started because the owner believed it was a good endeavor, but many owners felt that it was difficult to manage the enlarged garden and eventually opened it through as a Private Garden in anticipation of receiving economic support. There are also owners who are willing to revitalize the area. In addition, profits are generated from facilities other than the gardens, and some operate related programs to promote the culture of gardening. For a sustainable Private Garden system, it is necessary to check the registration criteria and establish a clear role in the region. There is also a need for further measures for management and marketing.

As a solution to this, it is necessary to establish a plan for restoration and management by referring to the vegetation and landscape remaining in the historic site as indicators. This study was conducted to provide basic data for vegetation and landscape management of Baekje Historic Sites in Seoul by comparing and analyzing location characteristics, existing vegetation, and remaining vegetation of past substitutional vegetation for Pungnaptoseong and Mongchontoseong, Baekje Historic Sites in Seoul. As a result of the study, Pungnaptoseong and Mongchontoseong are located near the main stream of the Han River, Pungnaptoseong is located on a flat land consisting of natural embankments and floodplains, and Mongchontoseong is located on a hilly area. In the case of existing vegetation, it has been confirmed that Pungnaptoseong mainly has ornamental trees planting sites, while Mongchontoseong has a distribution of residual species from the past that grow in villages and hilly lowlands. The Substitutional vegetation of Pungnaptoseong and Mongchontoseong was synthesized based on the location characteristics and actual vegetation, it is estimated that the hilly areas may have been divided into “Quercus aliena Blume.”, “Quercus mongolica Fisch. ex Ledeb.” and so on, “Pinus densiflora Siebold & Zucc.” on dry land,“Salix koreensis Andersson.”, “Juglans mandshurica Maxim.”, “Alnus japonica (Thunb.) Steud.” in rivers and tributaries, “Quercus acutissima Carruth.” in the main part of the forest, “Pinus densiflora Siebold & Zucc.”, “Salix koreensis Andersson.”, “Zelkova serrata (Thunb.) Makino.” as a divine tree in the beginning of the village.
Since the 1960s, all substitutional vegetation in the past has disappeared due to the introduction of foreign species and the creation of urban areas in Pungnaptoseong and Mongchontoseong, and the landscape has also been damaged. Fortunately, the substitutional vegetation was estimated in consideration of the species of residual trees distributed along the walls, climate, location characteristics, and times, but this study was conducted based on literature and existing vegetation surveys. Therefore, it is necessary to supplement the past target vegetation in Baekje historical sites in Seoul through quantitative experiments such as plant relic analysis in the future.",차두원,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A87007003
심층신경망 모형을 이용한 서울시 도시공원 및 녹지공간의 열섬저감효과 분석,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) Effect has intensified due to urbanization and heat management at the urban level is treated as an important issue. Green space improvement projects and environmental policies are being implemented as a way to alleviate Urban Heat Islands. Several studies have been conducted to analyze the correlation between urban green areas and heat with linear regression models. However, linear regression models have limitations explaining the correlation between heat and the multitude of variables as heat is a result of a combination of non-linear factors. This study evaluated the Heat Island alleviating effects in Seoul during the summer by using a deep neural network model methodology, which has strengths in areas where it is difficult to analyze data with existing statistical analysis methods due to variable factors and a large amount of data. Wide-area data was acquired using Landsat 8. Seoul was divided into a grid (30m x 30m) and the heat island reduction variables were enter in each grid space to create a data structure that is needed for the construction of a deep neural network using ArcGIS 10.7 and Python3.7 with Keras. This deep neural network was used to analyze the correlation between land surface temperature and the variables. We confirmed that the deep neural network model has high explanatory accuracy. It was found that the cooling effect by NDVI was the greatest, and cooling effects due to the park size and green space proximity were also shown. Previous studies showed that the cooling effects related to park size was 2℃-3℃, and the proximity effect was found to lower the temperature 0.3℃-2.3℃.

Additionally, this study aims to identify the problems occurring in the process of the performance of landscaping supervision and to provide the evidence for legislative activities and revision of the laws currently being pushed forward for the mandatory deployment of apartment house landscaping supervision personnel. The results of the analysis showed that no landscaping supervision personnel was deployed to apartment complexes with less than 1,500 households and that the landscaping comprised 19% to 46% of the entire construction process. The civil engineering firm performed the landscaping supervision, which made it impracticable to fully focus on the construction quality in the field of landscaping. The quality control in terms of landscape plants revealed differences in quality control, depending on the competence and experience of the civil engineer supervising the personnel, where the landscaping supervision personnel was not deployed. The apartment houses landscaping supervision activity index was analyzed, and the results showed that the supervision activity index for apartment house A was 72.0, B was 70.4, and apartment houses C to G ranged from 38.7 to 46.9, which suggested that the difference in quality control, process control, and technical support affected the construction quality and occurrence of defects.The improvement of landscaping process quality control and process management will be carried out more smoothly and the rate of defects will be drastically reduced if the landscaping supervision personnel placement threshold is lowered from 1,500 households to 300 households in complexes.

랜드스케이프 어바니즘 관점에서 본 도시재생 전략 연구,"This study aims to propose practical strategies for the new urban ideal of regeneration. A book review highlights the emergence of new trends of urbanization in knowledge-information industrial society beyond the new town Ideal of the industrial society. The meaning of ‘landscape’ in landscape urbanism represents not the visual and decorative pictures, but the dynamic process in the context of changes and evolutions. Also, knowledge-information industrial society and landscape have a meaning in the same context of flow and process with changes of velocity. Finally, these key words convey a meaning with the new urban trends of urbanization in knowledge-information industrial society in the context of value-oriented characteristics of dynamics and process. Urban regeneration is emerging as the new urban ideal in the knowledge-information industrial society, beyond the new town ideal of industrial society. It is in the same context as landscape urbanism with respect to green infrastructure buildings and designs for the transformation of urban surfaces covered with concrete and asphalt into the ecological surface, and of the ecological surfaces into the cultural surface that could be communicated with human beings. This research revealed the six strategies for urban regeneration as follows. The First, the strategies for the transformation of urban surfaces into ecological surfaces, the second, the strategies for the transformation of ecological surfaces into cultural surfaces, the third, the introduction of mixed and convergence land use, the forth, the transformation of former sites(e.g. military and factory) into urban parks, the fifth, the introduction of waterfront park zones that have the function of ecological and park-oriented mixed land use and, the sixth, the building and design of green infrastructure in the residential and commercial complex in CBD. These strategies call for the reforms of development laws and regulations to restrict building coverage ratio, building heights, and the introduction of park-oriented mixed zoning regulations. Another method for implementating the above listed strategies was the introduction of a strategic planning system instead of the traditional master plan system.

입체적 도시기반시설로서 완충녹지의 공원화 계획 -대구광역시 신매시장 완충녹지 공원화 계획을 사례로-,"In Korea, efforts have been made continuously to improve the environment of traditional markets concerning the issues of urban regeneration. In particular, many old cities and traditional markets face a lack of parking spaces. As a solution to this, attempts are being made to prepare underground parking spaces by designing urban planning facilities in three-dimensional ways and utilizing the upper part as a more meaningful space. This study is about the master plan to use the upper green area while creating an underground parking lot at 571 Sinmae-dong, Suseong-gu, Daegu. This green area was defined as a space with dual values, ‘defensive green space’ that needs to be ecologically protected, and ‘active cultural space’ where walking flows to the market and various events are concentrated. Three specific design strategies to balance these values were presented. First, to prevent indiscriminate occupation and damage by people and maintain a healthy green environment, securing the maximum amount of undivided green space in the site was suggested. Second, a space layout and a topography and planting patterns that can overcome the morphological characteristics of narrow and long-shaped sites enable the experience of abundant green spaces. Third, providing space to strengthen the connections with nearby urban facilities such as Sinmae Market and Gosan Library can also intensively accommodate cultural activities in various cities.

A field survey was conducted on the planting status of Seoul Children's Grand Park, a large-scale neighborhood park in Seoul, and based on the survey data, a planting function evaluation was conducted, and areas needing improvement in planting function were identified. The planting function evaluation was carried out considering the park function setting, planting concept according to spatial function, and planting status. As a result of the study, the direction of planting renewal according to functional change was derived for each stage of planting function evaluation. Increasing the green area ratio is a priority in setting up park functions, but user convenience should also be considered. As a concept of planting, visual landscape planting involves planting species with beautiful tree shapes, high carbon absorption, and fine dust reduction effects. Ecological landscape planting should create a multi-layered planting site on a slope. Buffer planting should be created as multi-layered forests to improve carbon absorption and fine dust reduction effects. Green planting should consist of broad-leaved trees and herbaceous layers and aim for the natural planting of herbaceous species. For plant species, species with high urban environment improvement effects, local native species, and wild bird preferred species should be selected. As for the planting structure, landscape planting sites and green planting sites should be composed of trees, shrubs, and trees and herbaceous layers that emphasize ecology or require multi-layered buffer functions. A higher standard is applied based on the planting interval for planting density. Installing a rainwater recycling facility and using soil loam for the planting base improves performance. The results of this study are meaningful in that they can be applied to derive areas needing functional improvement by performing planting function evaluation when planning planting renewal of aging urban parks and can suggest renewal directions that reflect the paradigm of functional change of created green areas.",박정아,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A87025702
쿤밍-몬트리올 글로벌 생물다양성 보전목표 성취를 위한 우리나라 OECM 발굴방향 연구 - 개념 고찰 및 전문가 인식을 중심으로 -,"This study aims to explore the direction for Korea's effective response to Target 3 (30by30), which can be said to be the core of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (K-M GBF) of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to find the direction of systematic OECM (Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures) discovery at the national level through a survey of global conceptual review and expert perception of OECM. This study examined ① the use of Korean terms related to OECM, ② derivation of determining criteria reflecting global standards, ③ deriving types of potential OECM candidates in Korea, and ④ considerations for OECM identification and reporting to explore the direction for identifying systematic, national-level OECM that complies with global standards and reflects the Korean context.First, there was consensus for using Korean terminology that reflects the concept of OECM rather than simple translations, and it was determined that “nature coexistence area” was the most preferred term (12 people) and had the same context as CBD 2050 Vision of “a world of living in harmony with nature.” This study suggests utilizing four criteria (1. No protected areas, 2. Geographic boundaries, 3. Governance/management, and 4. Biodiversity value) that reflect OECM’s core characteristics in the first-stage selection process, carrying out the consensus-building process (stage 2) with the relevant agencies, and adding two criteria (3-1 Effectiveness and sustainability of governance and management and 4-1 Long-term conservation) and performing the in-depth diagnosis in stage 3 (full assessment for reporting). The 28 types examined in this study were generally compatible with OECMs (4.45-6.21/7 points, mean 5.24). In particular, the ""Conservation Properties (6.21 points)"" and ""Conservation Agreements (6.07 points)"", which are controlled by National Nature Trust, are shown to be the most in line with the OECM concept. They were followed by ""Buffer zone of World Natural Heritage (5.77 points)"", ""Temple Forest (5.73 points)"", ""Green-belt (Restricted development zones, 5.63 points)"", ""DMZ (5.60 points)"", and ""Buffer zone of biosphere reserve (5.50 point)"" to have high potential. In the case of “Uninhabited Islands under Absolute Conservation”, the response that they conformed to the protected areas (5.83/7 points) was higher than the OECM compatibility (5.52/7 points), it is determined that in the future, it would be preferable to promote the listing of absolute unprotected islands in the Korea Database on Protected Areas (KDPA) along with their surrounding waters (1 km). Based on the results of a global OECM standard review and expert perception survey, 10 items were suggested as considerations when identifying OECM in the Korean context. In the future, continuous research is needed to identify the potential OECMs through site-level assessment regarding these considerations and establish an effective in-situ conservation system at the national level by linking existing protected area systems and identified OECMs.",허학영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108736954
3D 스캔 분석을 통한 전통조경 계획 및 설계 활용방안,"This study aims to apply 3D scanning technology to the field of landscape planning design. Through this, 3D scans were conducted on Soswaewon Garden and Seongrakwon Gardens to find directions for traditional landscape planning and designs.
The results as follows.
First, the actual measurement of the traditional garden through a 3D scan confirmed that a precise three-dimensional modeling of ±3-5mm error was constructed through the merging of coordinate values based on point data acquired at each observation point and postprocessing.
Second, as a result of the 3D survey, the Soswaewon Garden obtained survey data on Jewoldang House, Gwangpunggak Pavilion, the surrounding wall, stone axis, and Aeyangdan wall, while the Seongnakwon Garden obtained survey data on the topography, rocks and waterways around the Yeongbyeokji pond area. The above data have the advantage of being able to monitor the changing appearance of the garden.
Third, spatial information developed through 3D scans could be developed with a three-dimensional drawing preparation and inspection tool that included precise real-world data, and this process ensured the economic feasibility of time and manpower in the actual survey and investigation of landscaping space. In addition, modelling with a three-dimensional 1:1 scale is expected to be highly efficient in that reliable spatial data can be maintained and reprocessed to a specific size depending on the size of the design. In addition, from a long-term perspective, the deployment of 3D scan data is easy to predict and simulate changes in traditional landscaping space over time.",신현실,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106345583
한국과 중국의 궁궐 내 교량에 관한 경관특성 비교 연구 - 조선시대와 명청시대를 중심으로 -,"A bridge is a structure constructed on water or in the air for convenient passage. Compared to other buildings, the building materials and structures of bridge required unique functions to cross the space. It depends on the productivity of the building, the level of science and technology, and the ecological environment of the building site. Also, it has important relationship with functions such as politics, military, economy, and life. Most of the academic research on bridges is focused on research in the field of bridge-building technology, so the study on the landscape aesthetics and history of bridges is lacking. Against this backdrop, the study will be valuable as a accumulation of both countries' understanding of bridge types, history and culture, as well as technical and aesthetic data, by analyzing the bridges located within the palaces of Korea and China.
The research method is to analyze the bridge through field survey and literature analysis.. First, the bridges of royal palace of Korea and China are to be classified quantitatively as physical shapes, landscapes, and decorations by comparing the materials, forms, landscapes, and decorative culture of bridges. Second, characteristics, common points, and differences are extracted by classifying bridges of both countries. Also, the results are discussed based on the physical environment or cultural background.
This would be worth cross-referencing in the building technology and aesthetics of the two countries.
For the first important characteristics of result, main materials of Korean and Chinese palaces are stone. However, the bridge in China's royal palaces is also focused on wood. Second, in terms of form, the bridges in the royal gardens of Korea and China are all based on the beam bridge. However, the specific form, ratio, style of the beam bridge, and airspace of arched bridge are very different. Third, most of the connection methods are focused on the over bridge. It values the convergence with the surrounding landscape. Due to the difference in the area and location of water, the bridge in the Korean palace is more focused on the convergence of the surrounding buildings and plants, while the bridge in the Chinese palace is more concerned about the harmony of hydration. Fourth, the decoration places importance on the artistry and aesthetics of both the bridges in Korea and China. There is a difference in style in the same type of decoration due to culture.",장푸천,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105995032
88올림픽공원 조각공원의 조성 과정 및 전후 담론의 해석,"The 88 Olympic Park is a monumental urban park in Seoul, developed to commemorate South Korea’s hosting of the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games. Initially conceived to emphasize the event slogan, ‘Cultural Olympics,' which was driven by the Korean government, the park, already designed and constructed by 1986, was reconfigured into a sculpture park following two international outdoor sculpture Olympiads and an invitational sculpture exhibition. This study takes a look at the process of redesigning the park into sculpture park and the socio-political discussions surrounding such a process, in order to reconsider the significance of the 88 Seoul Olympic Park with regards to Korean landscape architectural history. Several discussions within Korean society arose during the redesign process. First, there were critiques on the artwork selection during the early phase of the project. Second, issues regarding the conservation of the national heritage site, Mongchon-tosung, located within the park, gave rise to a larger discourse on heritage preservation in Seoul. Third, discussions regarding the formation of the park identity, or lack thereof, prevalent. Through this study, the 88 Seoul Olympic Park presents itself as an example where large park construction in Seoul caused discussions regarding globalization, nationalism, publicness and art to be brought forth. This paper concludes that the 88 Seoul Olympic Park is a cultural landscape that requires further examination and exploration as it provides rich historical context for understanding the history of cultural and artistic practices in Korean urban landscapes.",신명진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101782164
제3세대 SNS에 표출된 공원 유형별 이용 특성 분석,"There have been studies on the satisfaction, preference, and post occupancy evaluation of urban parks in order to reflect users’ preferences and activities, suggesting directions for future park planning and management. Despite using questionnaires that are proven to be affective to get users’ opinions directly, there haven been limitations in understanding the latest changes in park use through questionnaires. This study seeks to address the possibility of utilizing the third-generation SNS data, Instagram and Google, to compare behavior patterns and trends in park activities. Instagram keywords and photos representing user’s feelings with a specific park name were collected. We also examined reviews, peak time, and popular time zones regarding selected parks through Google. This study tries to analyze users’ behaviors, emerging activities, and satisfaction using SNS data. The findings are as follows. People using park near residential areas tend to enjoy programs being operated in indoor facilities and to like to use picnic places. In an adjacent park of commercial areas, eating in the park and extended areas beyond the park boundaries is found to be one of the popular park activities. Programs using open spaces and indoor facilities were active as well. Han River Park as a detached park type offers a popular venue for excercises and scenery appreciation. We also identified companionship characteristics of different park types from texts and photos, and extracted keywords of feelings and reviews about parks posted in 3rd generation SNS. SNS data can provide basis to grasp behavioral patterns and satisfaction factors, and changes of park activities in real time. SNS data also can be used to set future directions in park planning and management in accordance with new technologies and policies.",김지은,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104901513
