of size, shape, or type. Therefore, it is very limited to establish a risk assessment framework
that accurately evaluated and manage the multi-dimension of marine environment including
seawater and sediment based on toxic data. In the study, we review the characteristics
and effects of marine environmental microplastic and suggest risk assessment framework
(draft) based on the distribution and impact of marine environmental microplastics.
Although, the characteristics of environmental microplastic are very widely but the most
abundant toxic data are concentrated on unique shape and type, and there are also large
gaps of test organism between laboratory-exposed organisms and resident species. Great
limitations with respect to toxicity data quality also exist for traditional effect assessment
methods, which in reliability of the resulting risk characterizations. However, considering
the fact that the international community's movement on microplastics management is
gradually strengthening and the pollution level of microplastics in marine environment
is increasing, further research on environmental relevant risk assessment technique should
be proposed based on the characteristics of microplastics in the marine environment.",정지현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108620948

Then, fisherman's activity and fishing production were decreased by changing of marine plankton composition and increasing of harmful marine organisms such as jellyfish, starfish and green laver bloom. Harmful red tides algae bloom and the deserted sea bottom often occurred due to increasing of sea water temperature and sea level rising in Korea. In this report, the cause and mechanism of the global warming phenomenon and it's effect on marine environment and marine ecosystem were introduced, and measures against global warming were suggested",김도희,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103023289
"악성 민원에 의한 공공기관 직원들의 감정노동, 회복탄력성, 사회적 지지, 삶의 질의 구조적 관계","Abstract This study examines the impact of malicious complaints on the life of employees in local government and the mediating effect of resilience and social support. A survey was conducted in April 2022 targeting 325 employees working in B metropolitan city, and the structural equation model was used for analyzing the survey data. The conclusions of this study are as follows. First, malicious complaints had a positive effect on emotional labor of the employees, and emotional labor did not directly affect the quality of life of them. Second, resilience and social support had a mediating effect on emotional labor and quality of life of the employees. In other words, emotional labor did not have a direct effect on the quality of life, but it was found that it was a powerful variable that affected th quality of life through self-regulation ability, interpersonal relationships, positivity, superior support, and peer support. Third, in the relationship between emotional labor, resilience, social support, and quality of life, there was a moderating effect among the three groups (Official, Indefinite contract worker, and Accredited police). Statistically significant differences were found in the effect of emotional labor on resilience and social support, and of resilience on quality of life.",양승은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108489768
‘바다’로 합의된 바다 : ‘카스피해’의 영유권 분쟁과 해결,"The purpose of this study was to examine the cause and progress of territorial issues in the Caspian Sea, and to analyze the positions of the coastal countries. Is the Caspian Sea surrounded by five countries in Central Asia a sea or a huge lake? The Caspian Sea is a rare case of gaining “the identity and legal status of the sea” in international interests rather than scientific evidence. Russia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan claimed the Caspian Sea as ‘sea’ and claimed sovereignty along their land border. In contrast, Iran and Turkmenistan claimed the Caspian Sea as a ‘lake’ and claimed a completely equal division of sovereignty. As the territorial dispute continued for a long time, all countries except Iran agreed that the Caspian Sea was a ‘sea’. The territorial dispute was settled under the ‘Caspian Convention’ in August 2018. The coastal countries agreed to define the Caspian Sea as a ‘special sea’, and signed an official treaty. The signing of the treaty has many positive aspects, but still contains some uncertainties. Therefore, the possibility of conflict remains in the future. In conclusion, this study also discussed the future direction of Korea's international response and cooperation to the Caspian Sea region.",우양호,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106408239
교대근무 간호사의 수면장애 경험: 현상학적 연구,"Abstract This study was performed to identify the essential structures and meanings of sleep disorder experience of shift work nurses. Giorgi's phenomenological methodology was used for study. Data were collected from ten nurses having sleep disorder with individual in-depth interviews and analyzed with the procedures suggested by Giorgi. The essential structures of the experience were constructed with 176 meaning units, 40 essential psychological meanings, 14 sub-constituents and seven constituents. The constituents were sleep disorder due to the tight nursing tasks, body and mind being broken, destructed life, suffering not empathized, concern about threat to patient care, making a breakthrough and accepting sleep disorder as a fate of nurses and withstanding. The results indicated that the mind and body of shift work nurses suffering sleep disorder have been broken down and the lives of them were destructed. Their sufferings were not empathized even from their co-workers or organization. However they concerned about the sleep disorder results into the mistakes in their nursing works. They tried to accept their sufferings as fates of shift work nurses and search various ways to withstand sleep disorder.

실습선원의 인권침해 개선에 관한 연구,"All people have human rights that should be protected, and today, the importance of protecting human rights is emphasized in all areas of society. The industry is also carrying out activities to protect the human rights of workers, such as implementing human rights education for human rights management and preparing a response system for human rights violations. However, due to the closed environment and special working conditions, seafarers on board are often placed in a blind spot in human rights protection. In particular, a number of cases of human rights violations concerning beginner seafarers, including cadets, have been identified, and relevant research is insufficient compared to other occupational groups. Jobs that restrict basic human rights cannot be envied by anyone. In this study, implications and problems were derived based on the results of a human rights survey of cadets, and cases of human rights violations, and improvement measures were proposed. The cadets had a very negative perception of human rights violations before boarding. However, it was found that their perception changed after boarding. It was confirmed that cadets have unnecessary fears and concerns before boarding. Improvement measures include the establishment of a legal system for the status of cadets, measures to alleviate non-physical human rights violations, improvement of human rights violations handling procedures and response systems, and enhancing the effectiveness of human rights education.",정선근,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108737103

조업기인 어업쓰레기 발생추정량에 대한 어업 및 해양환경 관련 정책 비교분석,"This study aimed to compare differences according to categories of fishery and marine environmental policies for the (estimated) amount of fishery waste generated by fishing, and to analyze the correlation between associated independent and dependent variables. The independent variables were divided into three different sectors. The first sector included precautionary policies that observed eco-friendly fishing support program, institutional prevention activities, and physical barriers installation. The second sector with the current management policies included the relevant vessel operations, establishment of fishery order, fishery restructuring, and fishery ground clean-up. Thirdly, post-response policies comprised the litter purification from river to shoreline, the collection and removal of marine, sedimentary, and floating debris, purchasing salvaged debris generated while fishing, fishery waste disposal, and repairing damage caused by marine litter. The indicator used was the settlement amount by each program. The dependent variable was the estimated amount of fishery waste and the indicator was the sum of the loss of traps and gill nets and the loss of their appendages. According to the results of Kruskal-Wallis Test, the estimated amount of fishery waste was highest in the East Sea in terms of sea area and the highest in the Si(city) according to basic local municipality. The settlement amount related to the marine environment services was largest in the Gun(county). Further, there were significant differences between Gun(county) and the other regions(Si(city) and Gu(autonomous district)) with respect to most variables. The variables related to the estimated amount of fishery debris were the project purchasing salvaged debris generated while fishing and fishery waste disposal program in the post-response policies.",성은혜,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108334043
동해의 해양침적쓰레기 성상 및 공간 분포 특성 연구,"The Korean Peninsula is surrounded on three sides by the East Sea, West Sea and South Sea which are connected to many rivers and streams, thereby facilitating easy inflow of debris from land. Furthermore, excessive debris inflow to the sea because of active fishing and various recreational activities. Debris entering the sea are weighted over time and settle in the seabed, thus, making direct monitoring of debris impossible and its collection difficult. Uncollected submerged marine debris affects the seabed ecosystem and water quality and can cause ghost fishing and ship accidents, especially due to waste net ropes and waste fishing gears. Therefore, understanding the debris distribution characteristics is necessary to assist quick collection of these debris (waste net ropes and waste fishing gears). Thus, this study conducted a survey of debris deposited in the seas of 39 ports. Furthermore, distribution characteristics and compositions of submerged marine debris were identified by a map prepared through GIS-based spatial analysis of the East Sea. Consequently, 58% of waste tires in the East Sea were concentrated in breakwaters and ship berthing facilities. Moreover, 26% of waste plastics were distributed outside the port. Identifying the distinct distribution characteristics of submerged marine debris was difficult; however, compared with others, the distribution of waste plastics was possible outside the port. The findings of this study can serve as baseline data to assist the collection of submerged marine debris using the distribution characteristics.",정민지,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107391697

선박교통관제에 관한 법률에 대한 비판적 고찰,"Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) is a system for ship safety and accident prevention. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and the Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) established regulations related to VTS from an early stage. On December 3, 2019, South Korea enacted a special act called the “Act on Vessel Traffic Services (VTS Act),” which will take effect on June 4, 2020. In this paper, the background of this act’s enactment is examined and its provisions are critically reviewed. In particular, the study intensively examines the reasons the immunity provisions for the VTS operator were removed and the current direction of improvements to the VTS Act is presented in terms of its feasibility. Most countries that do not have an Act related to VTS and its operator, refer to that of Korea. Therefore, it is necessary to reinforce the structures and definition of the VTS Act, as well as the immunity provisions for the VTS operator. The latter were removed during the National Assembly’s legislation process, but were included in the initial bill, and should be reflected in subsequent revisions of the VTS Act.",신동호,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106928623

디지털 기반 교육역량 함양을 위한 예비 교사의 교육과정 개발 요구 분석,"Abstract The purpose of this study was to analyze the perceptions and demands of pre-service teachers regarding the development of a digital-based educational competency development curriculum and to draw implications accordingly. An online survey was conducted in this study. The subjects of the survey were prospective teachers who are completing teaching profession courses. The results of the study are as follows. First, it was confirmed that prospective teachers were familiar with utilization of digital devices and digital-based communication and cooperation, but were not yet familiar with new technologies such as programming understanding (computing thinking), big data, and artificial intelligence. Second, pre-service teachers most experienced real-time lecture platforms and online/offline linked classes in university classes. And they agreed that students should develop digital basic literacy through all subject classes. Third, the competencies that prospective teachers most wanted to develop were the selection, production, and utilization of digital-based materials and the vitalization of interaction using digital resources. Fourth, as a result of analyzing the perception of the appropriate teaching and learning method of the subject for the development of digital-based educational competency, the demand for the PBL method was the highest. The conclusions are as follows. First, it is necessary to review ways to open and operate digital-based educational competency training courses for prospective teachers in various levels, such as 2 credits or 3 credits. Second, when developing a curriculum to develop digital-based educational capabilities for prospective teachers, it is necessary to dualize the contents of the curriculum. Third, the subject needs to be operated by using a combination of the PBL (project learning, problem-based learning) method, individual practice, and the lecture method of a professional instructor. Fourth, teacher training institutions need to expand facilities and equipment that can utilize digital platforms, technologies and tools.

A total of 250 samples by 0.02 $m^2$ box corer for the benthic fauna in Songdo tidal flat and 50 samples by 0.1 $m^2$ van Veen grab in Youngil Bay were taken from the total sampling area of 5 $m^2$. It was assumed that the sampling area could contain sufficient information on sediment fauna, if cumulative number of species, ecological indices, and similarity index by cluster analysis reflect the similarity level of 75% to those found at total sampling area (5 $m^2$). A total of 56 and 60 species occurred from Songdo tidal flat and Youngil Bay, respectively. The cumulative curve of the species number ($N_{sp}$) as a function of the sampling area (A in $m^2$ ) was fitted as $N_{sp}=37.379A^{0.257}$ ($r^2=0.99$) for intertidal fauna and $N_{sp}=40.895A^{0.257}$ ($r^2=0.98$) for subtidal fauna. Based on these curves and 75% of similarity to the total sampling area (5 $m^2$), the optimum sampling area was proposed as 1.6 $m^2$ for the intertidal and 1.5 $m^2$ for the subtidal fauna. Ecological indices (species diversity, richness, evenness and dominance indices) were again calculated on the basis of species composition in differently simulated sample sizes. Changes in ecological indices with these sample sizes indicated that samplings could be done by collecting fauna from < 0.5 $m^2$-1.5 $m^2$ on the Songdo tidal flat and from < 0.5 $m^2$-1.2 $m^2$ in Youngil Bay. Changes in similarity level of all units of each simulated sample size showed that sampling area of 0.3 $m^2$ (Songdo tidal flat) and 0.6 $m^2$ (Youngil Bay) should be taken to obtain a similarity level of 75%. In conclusion, sampling area which was determined by cumulative number of species, ecological indices and similarity index by cluster analysis could be determined as 1.5 $m^2$ (0.02 $m^2$ box corer, n=75) for Songdo tidal flat and 1.2 $m^2$ (0.1 $m^2$ van Veen grab, n=12) for Youngil Bay. If these sampling areas could be covered in the field survey, population densities of seven dominant species comprising 68% of the total faunal abundance occurring on Songdo tidal flat and six species comprising 90% in Youngil Bay can be estimated at the precision level of P=0.2.",고철환,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100825960
문섬 등 주변해역 생태계보호구역 내 산호군락지의 보전가치,"The Korean government has been trying to conserve a marine ecosystem that has been shifting due to climate change. As part of this effort, the government designated seventy-seven marine species that have been disappearing and deserve to be protected as endangered managing them specially. To generate basic data to guide policy for these endangered species, their value must be measured. OOf the species declared endangered, coral is particularly threatened by climate change, and its management is important. Accordingly, understanding the potential value of reefs, can be an effective way of proving the benefits of continuous management to decision makers and the general public alike. To this end, we have applied the contingent valuation method (CVM), an economic technique of for valuing a environmental and non-market goods such as a coral reef. A national face-to-face survey of 1,000 randomly selected households was conducted in order to determine the public’s willingness to pay (WTP) for conserving coral reefs. A one-and-one-half-bound (OOHB) model was adopted to interpret WTP responses, and a spike model was employed to deal with zero WTP responses. The results show that the conservation value of a coral reef can be estimated at 3,016 won per household per year, statistically significant at the 1% level. Expanding values to the national population gives an annual value of 58.9 billion won.
