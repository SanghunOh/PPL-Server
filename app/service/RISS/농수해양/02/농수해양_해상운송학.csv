To achieve this, the study examines the factors influencing the adoption andimplementation of ESG activities, assesses the extent to which ESG activities enhance corporate trustand image, and empirically analyzes the effect of ESG implementation on the corporate performanceof logistics companies. An online survey was conducted using Google Forms for Korean logisticscompanies, and a total of 463 data sets were utilized for PLS structural equation analysis usingthe SmartPLS 4.0 software tools. The findings of the study are as follows: Firstly, external pressure,specifically government pressure, significantly influences environmental responsibility activities, whileinvestor pressure significantly affects social responsibility activities and governance responsibilityactivities. Additionally, internal management pressures significantly impact environmental responsibilityactivities, and employees have a significant influence on all ESG responsibility activities.
Secondly, environmental responsibility activities positively affect corporate image, whereas social andgovernance responsibility activities influence trust and corporate image. Thirdly, trust and corporateimage demonstrate significant effects on both financial and non-financial performance. Fourthly, trustsignificantly mediates the relationship between social responsibility, governance responsibility, andnon-financial performance, while image mediates the connection between ESG responsibility andboth financial and non-financial performance. The contribution of this study lies in providing practicalinsights for logistics companies to actively promote ESG activities, thereby establishing a reputationfor being environmentally, socially, and governance responsible and gaining customer trust.
By doing so, this study aims to raise awareness of the importance of ESG activities in the logisticsindustry and help companies recognize their significance for sustainable management",김영수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108667133
"국제개발협력 사업, ‘스리랑카 해양쓰레기 관리능력 개발’의 결과와 시사점","A project to build capacity of managing marine debris in Sri Lanka was conducted from 2015 to 2017. This project, supported by Expo 2012 Yeosu Korea Foundation, is classified as an ODA (Official Development Assistance) program. In this project, first, legal institution related to marine debris management was analyzed. Though there is a strong punishment rule on waste dumping, the rule has not been properly implemented due to weak power of administration. Second, marine debris in fishing ports, beaches, coral reefs, and Mangroves were surveyed to obtain data for policy making. This survey revealed that there are less debris in fishing ports and coral reefs compared to expectation, and that marine debris is abundant in beaches and in Mangroves. Third, the priority of policy alternatives was assessed with AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) analysis by professionals in Sri Lanka, in order to establish the management strategy. The alternatives assessed as high priority were (1) Rigid enforcement of existing regulation and formulating new ones, (2) Marine debris reception facilities on beaches, and (3) Collecting waste from valuable and sensitive ecosystems such as Mangroves. As many factors are influencing the marine debris problem, an integrated approach with social and natural sciences need to be applied for ODA projects related to marine debris.",장용창,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106070788
해적행위에 대한 법적 책임과 대응방안,"Piracy is the enemy of the human race. Pirates commit acts of murder, robbery, plunder or other villainous deeds at sea, cruelly against humanity. The Republic of Korea(ROK), as a big maritime country, is obliged to suppress piracy under international treaties it ratified, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the two 1988 Conventions against maritime terrorism. The Korean government is recently taking a positive attitude towards the regional cooperation which is necessary for the suppression of piracy in the waters of Southeast Asia. In spite of the effects of international cooperation to prevent piracy, it is recently on an increasing trend every year. Such circumstances may have a bad effects on the sound development of world economy by means of trade at sea as well as treat to the safety of crews and safe operation of ships. This paper aims to suggest the countermeasures against piracy in terms of criminal law, civil law and international law in order to secure safe operation of vessels at sea.",최석윤(Suk-Yoon Choi),2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99562184

And thus study on Wave transformation around coastal is very important to develope a new port or on industrial area. Delft 3D-WAVE is applied to Ulsan new port area and the calculated results are analysed and compared with measured data. Delft 3D wave module is based on SWAN model which considers wave shoaling and refraction for irregular wave. This module also covers wind effect, bottom friction, white-capping and wave breaking effect. The results of this study show a good agreement with measured data and thus Delft 3D-WAVE module can be applied to simulate irregular wave transformation in coastal area.",김재중(Kim Jae-Joong),2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99562196
공급망 리스크가 항만 컨테이너 물동량에 미치는 영향에관한 연구: 부산항 사례를 중심으로,"As the scope of supply chains expands globally, unpredictable risks continue to arise. The occurrenceof these supply chain risks affects port cargo throughput and hinders port operation. Inorder to examine the impact of global supply chain risks on port container throughput, this studyconducted an empirical analysis on the impact of variables such as the Global Supply ChainPressure Index (GSCPI), Shanghai Container Freight Index (SCFI), Industrial Production Index, andRetail Sales Index on port traffic using the vector autoregressive(VAR) model. As a result of theanalysis, the rise in GSCPI causes a short-term decrease in the throughput of Busan Port, but aftera certain point, it acts as a factor increasing the throughput and affects it in the form of a wave.
In addition, the industrial production index and the retail sales index were found to have no statisticallysignificant effect on the throughput of Busan Port. In the case of SCFI, the effect was almostsimilar to that of GSCPI. The results of this study reveal how risks affect port cargo throughputin a situation where supply chain risks are gradually increasing, providing many implicationsfor establishing port operation policies for future supply chain risks.",김성기,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108667129
국민환경의식 변화와 해양생태계 관련 법제의 검토 - 한국사회에서 보전과 개발에 대한 대립관점을 중심으로 -,"Since marine space has traditionally been recognized as a place for development, the importance of legislation on marine environmental protection tends to be neglected. However, in a circumstance that the national environmental consciousness has been increasing, it would be necessary to review how the legislation on marine environmental protection is reflecting the national environmental consciousness and their policy demands. Therefore this study, focused on marine ecosystem, understood the limitations of the legal system on marine ecosystem protection caused by relation between ‘conservation’ and ‘development’ based on the process of formation and development of the marine-related legislation, social background, and national environmental consciousness in the past in Korea. In addition, it looked over how national environmental consciousness has been changed and how it has been reflected in the legislation on marine ecosystem protection, and finally suggested improvements on the legislation on marine ecosystem protection by grasping current national environmental consciousness.",윤소라,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106070791

항만물류조직구성원들의 보안능력에 영향을 미치는 요인,"Currently, despite having active movements related to port logistics security, there is lack of awareness, education, and security systems related to port technology. Before implementing port logistics security, a mutual authentication agreement should be reached through the establishment of an integrated network that can share port logistics security information in real time. In order to achieve port competitiveness and strengthen logistics service, establishment of national strategy for logistics security is necessary. However, there is an urgent need to raise the security consciousness among the port logistics organization members and enhance the information security ability which is a crucial feature of the port logistics organization. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the information security capacity of port logistics organization members. Even though the analysis rejected the hypothesis that security regulations affect security awareness, the security activities and security awareness were significantly correlated. It also has a positive impact on the relationship between security norms and security abilities, and security awareness and security abilities.",강다연,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106259703
Container Terminal Efficiency Measurement Using Data Envelopment Analysis: Pre-Pandemic Comparison of Colombo and Busan,"Increasing port competition driven by the containerisation has motivated ports and terminals to focus on their performance to efficiently utilise the available resources and to make strategic decisions in port development and expansion. With both inter-port and intra-port competition increasing in the port of Colombo, this study aims to measure the efficiency of the container terminals in Colombo comparing to terminals in the port of Busan using the DEA window analysis to determine their operational efficiency and to provide suggestions for future port development activities. Multiple window analyses were conducted using CCR and BCC models with different orientations and window lengths to compare the efficiencies of 11 DMUs in both ports during the period from 2015-2019 to measure the efficiencies prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Results revealed the largest terminal operator, PNC in Busan, to be the most efficient overall, while the second highest efficiency was recorded by one of the smallest terminal operators, SAGT in Colombo, among the sample.
Although use of DEA in port performance measurement has been popular for many years, efficiency measurements in the port of Colombo, the main hub port in the South Asian region, has not been comprehensively studied so far.",Naleen De Alwis,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108585694
친환경 투수 콘크리트 바이오 블록의 개발,"Rising sea levels along the coast from global warming causes the increase of wave energy along the coast. This rise in sea levels results in relatively deep water levels, which would incur the loss of sand that had not occurred in the past from erosion in coastal areas. Generally, it has been challenging to protect against coastal erosion, and the slope, cross-sectional shape, and materials are selected for the site conditions depending on the change in external forces. However, the application of counter measures based on insufficient understanding of the phenomenon is causing various damage, indicating the need for technological development and converging technologies to improve credibility. In this study, we developed eco-friendly permeable biopolymer concrete blocks to control the coastal erosion by using the Bio-Coast, an effective porous structure that mitigates the destructive erosion caused by the rising sea levels. The hexagonal design of Bio-Coast was derived from the honeycomb, columnar joints, and clover, which are durable and stable structures in nature, and the design was changed to apply bumps on the Bio-Coast filling in the form of a clover to reduce wave overtopping and run-up. Applying the field condition of beaches on the east coast of Korea, the block weight and size were decided and the prototype blocks were manufactured and are ready for field placement. In particular, it is intended to protect coastal areas from destructive erosion by natural and artificial external forces, and to extend the design to river,s lakes, and natural walking trails, to improve the efficiency of quality control and process control through the use of blocks.",송현우,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107018254
유엔지속가능발전목표14 해양생태계와 북한 개발협력,"This study aims to review the current status of North Korea regarding the United Nations(UN) Sustainable Development Goal(SDG) 14 and development cooperation with North Korea. In order to achieve this goal, an analytical framework was developed, based on the concept, characteristics, sub-goals and indicators of the SDG 14. The current status of North Korea’s seas and use of marine resources were reviewed according to this framework. It is appeared to be deteriorated not only in respect of marine pollution, biodiversity, and protected areas but also Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated(IUU) fishing and small-scale fisher’s access to marine resources, etc. International society’s development cooperation with North Korea has centered around aquaculture, regional sea programmes, and protection of migratory birds. While South Korea has been one of major donors of UN fundraising for the North, SDG 14 tends to be pushed back on the priority list. As SDG 14 is closely related with other goals such as SDG 2, 13, and 15, which have been included on the priorities of UN development cooperation with the North, future development cooperation needs to be promoted in the direction of intertwining related SDGs.",윤인주,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106930800
DEA를 활용한 국내 벌크터미널의 효율성 평가 연구,"About 67% of Korea's port volumes are handled in bulk terminals, but studies evaluating the efficiency of bulk terminals in Korea are extremely limited. Precise diagnosis and assessment of the current service levels of bulk terminals in Korea are required to improve their degraded service performance.
To that end, this study conducted the efficiency assessment of 13 types of bulk terminals in Korea using DEA. To be specific, Super-SBM was applied along with existing models in order to identify the difference among decision making units (DMUs) of which efficiency value is 1. After carrying out the efficiency assessment by selecting and applying input factors (berth length, cargo handling capacity, and average depth) and output variables (throughput of dedicated items), it was found that Iron Ore terminal recorded the highest score (1st), followed by oil terminal (2nd) and terminals for general cargo, scrap, lumber showed low efficiency by taking the 11th, 12th, and 13th place, respectively.",이나영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108168480
해양포유류 보호를 위한 수중 소음 관리 제도 도입 방안,"Increased human activities in the marine environments have caused the increase of anthropogenic underwater noise in the oceans. Many countries are concerning about the harmful effects on marine mammals derived from the noise, and have legal frame to manage the negative noise effects on the marine environments. Korean government is planning to construct large offshore wind farms off the west and south coast of Korean peninsula and around Jeju island. There has been no laws and policies about the underwater noise management to protect marine mammals in Korea. This paper reviewed the guidelines by U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the effects of anthropogenic sound on marine mammal hearing, and assessed the impacts from the construction of wind farms off Jeju island on the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins inhabiting the area. Finally the recommendations to establish proper legal frame for the management of the underwater noise in Korean waters are given.",손호선,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103776373
컨테이너터미널 자동화에 대한 관련 주체별 인식연구,"The production of larger of ships is a survival strategy for global shipping companies to pursue the economics of scale. According to this strategy, to respond to this situation, many containers are loading/unloading simultaneously in the hub port. Additionally, the container terminals are promoting the introduction of automation to expand the terminal facilities and increase efficiency/productivity of the container yards. European ports have introduced automation to address rising labor costs and shortages of labor. Recently, the construction of fully automated container terminals is increasing in the United States and China to resolve problems such as the slow growth of the global economy, the emergence of large ships, air pollution, and safety accidents. Domestic ports are at an early stage compared to the world's advanced container terminals, and countermeasures are being prepared to respond to the changing ports. However, research on the recognition difference analysis that examines the opinions of stakeholders is insufficient. As a result of analyzing the recognition among the groups, it was found that container terminal operators reduced labor costs, improved shipping services for shipping companies, prevented safety accidents for port union labor, and increased service for port authority and government agencies. Thus, to closely examine the perception among the groups, one-way ANOVA was performed, and then the implications were deduced as the basic data for the smooth introduction of automation.",유지원,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106920431
