In particular, we analyzed what characteristics of Cyber- Wrecker encouraged toxicity in comments at the video level by selecting four representative Cyber-Wreckers on YouTube, collecting about 290,000 comments on 370 videos from their channels, and classifying malicious comments with an artificial neural network to measure the degree of toxicity production. To do so, we tested research hypotheses drawing upon 1) the structural conditions of YouTubers’ anonymity, 2) normative conformity among users performing grouporiented thoughts and behaviors toward Cyber-Wrecker, and 3) the reinforcement of hate projected on the target of Cyber-Wrecker that stimulated in-group unity and out-group hostility through the echochamber effect. The results showed that anonymous Cyber-Wreckers were more effective in generating toxicity than those that revealed their identities, and that toxicity production increased when the targets of Cyber-Wrecker were socially hated. In other words, Cyber-Wrecker’s sensationalized coverage of celebrities and public figures was effective in increasing toxicity by selecting targets that reflected hate sentiments of our society. On the other hand, overtly malicious videos, such as biased portrayals and mockery, had no significant effect on the production of toxicity. Based on the results, this study sheds light on how Cyber-Wreckers as an emerging online content creator promotes the spread of toxicity and discusses ways to understand and address the growing influence of the personalized media ecosystem, not only at the industrial level but also culturally.",이신행,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639569
생성형 AI가 출판 환경에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구,"ChatGPT is popular all over the world and shows the potential to exert a great influence on society as a whole. The importance of ChatGPT is that it became a catalyst for the public to directly experience generative AI services. Generative AI is already being evaluated as having enough potential to bring about many changes in all areas of society. The publishing sector is no exception. Rather, publishing is more likely to be impacted by generative AI than other fields. This study was conducted to know and prepare for how generative AI will affect the future of publishing. Among the currently existing generative AI services, marketing work, image, and audio fields were analyzed as those that can directly affect the publishing process. Subsequently, as a result of analyzing how generative AI can change writing, which is the core of publishing, it was found that generative AI is already being actively used in a wide spectrum of planning, question-and-answer, collaboration, and mixed content writing. The development and proliferation of generative AI is bringing new opportunities and challenges to publishing.",이승환,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108634888
젠더갈등은 어떻게 우리 사회의 주요 담론이 되었는가?: 보수언론의 젠더갈등 기사 분석을 중심으로,"This study examines the methods used by Korea’s major conservative media to create discourse regarding gender conflict in 2021, when the theme of ‘Men in their 20s undergoing reverse discrimination’ rose as a main deciding factor in the election. More specifically, this study examines the following: which individual or organization is specified to be the reason and agent of conflict when discussing gender conflict, whose voice is represented as the elites of discord who explain and criticize gender conflict while leading the discourse, the context of gender conflict shown in reports about gender conflict, who is pointed out as responsible of generating gender conflict, and whether reports of gender conflict focus on relaying the conflict or suggesting an alternative. To do this, this study examined and analyzed news from Chosun Ilbo, Donga Ilbo, and Joongang Ilbo in 2021. As a result, this study reveals that discussion of gender conflict in 2021 took place mostly in political circles and online, and the main speakers of gender conflict issues are a small number of elites of discord such as politicians, online male- dominated communities, Jin JoonGwan etc. Also, those who assume systematic sexual discrimination (such as the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, feminism or feminists) and promote policies preferential to women, which is the premise for reverse male discrimination, are targeted as the main contributor of gender conflict. Those excluded from the discourse of gender conflict are the history of sexual discrimination, discussion of existing sexual discrimination, and the voice of men and women of the real world in their 20s. This study points out the risk of the current gender conflict discourse having a negative effect on solving the social reconstruction crisis that Korea’s society is currently facing, and proposes the necessity of a constructive gender conflict discourse.",홍지아,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108174468
기업의 ESG 경영에 대한 소비자 인식에 관한 연구: MZ세대를 중심으로,"Recently, Expectations and interest in ESG management of corporation are increasing significantly. However, research on ESG management focuses on the financial aspect of corporation, so there is a lack of systematic research on consumers' perceptions. Therefore, this study identified consumers' perceptions of ESG management of corporation, and attempted to examine the effect of consumers' perceptions of ESG management on the intangible performance of corporation. In particular, we explored differences in perceptions between generations, focusing on the MZ generation, which corporations are paying attention to ethical management and good consumption. As a result of the study, the non-MZ generation had a higher level of awareness of the necessity and importance of ESG management than the MZ generation. However, the influence of the necessity and importance of the personal level and social level on corporate performance variables for ESG management was more positive for MZ generation. Specifically, the recognition of the necessity and importance of ESG management of the MZ generation was positively significant in terms of purchase intention of products and services, social connection with corporations, corporate reputation, and word of mouth intention. As a result, it was confirmed that the significant possibilities that the MZ generation could have on corporate performance. Through the results of this study, it is expected that it will be possible to present a practical direction that the level of awareness of ESG management needs to be improved and a detailed strategy between generations is needed.",강윤지,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108100186
친밀환상의 작동 방식: 팬플랫폼 ‘버블’ 이용자를 중심으로,"Fan platform “Bubble” is a service in which one-sided message exchange between k-pop idols and fans consists of conversations. Its emergence reinforced the intimacy fantasy of k-pop fandom and, at the same time, exposed the structure. This study attempted to see what emotions and relationships the use of Bubble causes and how it is accepted and managed. To this end, 22 people with experience in using Bubble were interviewed and analyzed. How do people enjoy the unique relationship and conversation in Bubble even though they understand that it is hypothetical? The reasons for it were fantasy and reality being mixed, the sense of intimacy being sensed first and considered more important than the recognition of fantasy, and the possibility of having intimate conversations itself functioning as a fact. The intimate sense felt in Bubble also showed desire and limitation. There was a desire to peek into the privacy of idols and to seek a romantic relationship, but the emotional norms based on fandom and age limited this. These desires, however, have sometimes been tolerated through various strategies and justifications. This paper is significant in that it was able to examine how consumers in the emotional market consume intimacy fantasies and emotions, and how they perceive norms and coordinate them with reality.",이나은,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108174469
"MZ세대에서의 브랜드 액티비즘 광고 효과: 이슈 적합성, 행위의 구체성, 일관성을 중심으로","This study was conducted to verify what factors can have positive effects on consumers’ responses, in the context of brand activism advertisement. In particular, this study conducted an experimental study on 181 MZ generations whether the issue fit, concreteness of the action and consistency of the brand activism advertisement act as factors affecting the authenticity perceived by consumers, and moreover, investigated what relations the perceived authenticity has with advertising attitude, brand attitude and purchase intention. The findings show that although the issue fit has no significant relation with the perceived authenticity, consumers more highly perceive it when a specific brand activity was described in the brand activism advertisement, than when it was not; when brand showed an activity consistent with the past one through the brand activism advertisement, than when it did not. On the other hand the perceived authenticity was found to have positive effects on attitude toward advertising, attitude toward brand and purchase intention. This study examined the brand activism which recently attracts attention, but has been rarely studied, in the advertising context, and provides a practical implication for brand communication practitioners in making effective strategy.",이지연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108058742
"OTT 서비스 확산이 콘텐츠 생산, 유통, 소비에 미친 영향에 관한 연구","This paper attempts to analyze the impacts of OTT service expansion on the production, distribution and consumption of video content. I reconceptualized the OTT service over time since its initial launch in the market and categorized the current OTT service players into the three types of business entity. More specifically, the players were grouped as one of the following category; content-based, platform-based, and devicebased one; and the primary resources of players in each group were analyzed. Following the notion of each classification, similar and different attributes of OTT players between the U.S. and the Korea were compared. Furthermore, I articulated the external and internal driving forces yielding the rapid expansion of OTT service. As for the external forces, multidevice availability owing to the technology development and change of media usage patterns were figured out as the main drivers. Meanwhile, innovative characteristics of OTT service such as usage convenience could be explained as the internal driving force in the wide spread of OTT service. From the industrial perspective, OTT service solved the narrow bottle-neck problem of video content distribution and provided contentbased players with new opportunities for building independent platform.",김영주,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103812409
‘빨리빨리’의 문화정치학: 한국의 ‘속도 커뮤니케이션’에 관한 연구,"Although the behavioral mode of 'Ppallippalli(hurriedly, hubba-hubba)' rules the all aspects of Korean people's everyday life, we have disregarded it as a topic of communication research. It may be a result of the principle of the academic division of labor which tends to regard the macroscopic environment of communication as a separate discipline. Starting from this reality of academic community, this essay studies the cultural politics of 'Ppallippalli' and presents the origin and pattern of 'speed communication.' Speed communication can be defined as communication that expresses and promotes speed. It includes not only the communicative characteristics of modern society that worships speed to the extent of generating a term 'speed capitalism,' but also the distinctiveness of Korean culture whose 'Ppallippalli' behavior is most prominent in the world. This study finds the five structural causes as the followings: 1) mono-polarism, 2) militarism, 3) exportism, 4) egalitarianism, 5) individual rushism. These five causes exert great influence on the Korean people's communication behavior in public and private ways, and vice versa. That is, while the five causes promoted the 'Ppallippalli' behavior, the speed communication, based on the 'Ppallippalli' principle, had effects that sustained or enforced the five causes.",강준만,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103980835
개인화 시대의 ‘개인주의’에 대한 개념적 탐색,"This study aims to explore the ideas of individualism in order to expand our understandings of ‘individualism’ and search for its conceptional possibility in terms of values and moral principle in the context of social structural transformation, namely, ‘individualization.’ To do this, first, the paper looks into its conceptual ambiguity and its complicated and multi-dimensional aspects of individualism by illuminating the western modern thoughts of individualism. Second, it attempts to elaborate the nature of equality and freedom as the core values of individualism by introducing four concepts such dignity, autonomy, privacy, and self-development. Third, this paper maps out the conflicts and confrontations surrounding individualism in historical contexts to see what individualism is and how it can be understood. Fourth, it discusses Georg ‘Simmel’ s two forms of individualism, which are Kant’s tradition vs. Goethe/ Nietzsche’s tradition. Finally, the paper introduces and inquires some issues which should be investigated in relation to individualism in the Korean social and cultural contexts.",김수정,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106119338
이용자의 확증편향과 설득지식 수준이 가짜뉴스 허구성 판단에 미치는 영향,"This study aims to examine how users' positive bias and level of persuasion knowledge can influence the judgment on the falsity of fake news. To this end, research was conducted through quantitative and qualitative methods. To begin with, we found out several meaningful results through examining the fake news to brand in a quantitative way. Firstly, the identification with product brand affected, even though not statistically significant, the judgment on the falsity, importance and reliability of fake news, Secondly, it was shown that brand identification had influence on the evaluation to the brand which was a news source. Third, the brand identification affected the level of persuasive knowledge. Forth, there was a high possibility of additional information check and news dissemination regardless of brand identification. The finding from the in-depth interview with media reporters, public relations practitioners, and an academic researcher was as follows. It was discussed that the social problem originated from fake news is serious and its spread is done mainly through SNS, as well as media education is required for settling the problem. Lastly, they suggested that in order to acquire the media credibility, the measures to root out fake news should be come up with.

20대 젠더 갈등에 대한 뉴스 의제 및 프레임 분석 : 토픽 모델링과 텍스트 분류 알고리즘을 이용한 2022년 선거 국면에서의 ‘이대남·이대녀’ 현상에 대한 언론보도 탐색,"This study identifies the political and social attributes of the ""Men and Women in their 20s"" agenda and analyzes the framing of the media coverage during the 2022 election campaign. In particular, we focus on the tendency of young adults in their 20s, who have been highlighted as a new political force, to be consumed by gender-based political conflicts, and capture how the media limited the complex agenda attributes of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda to gender-conflicting issues in the 20s. First, we conducted topic modeling on 3,431 relevant news articles to identify agenda attributes, and extracted detailed topics of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda and clustered them based on policy-social agenda attributes and male-female agenda attributes. Most of the extracted topics were related to the campaigns of political candidates in the 20th presidential election, confirming the consumption of 'Men and Women in their 20s' in a political context. Next, we analyzed the composition of gender frames in the coverage of the 'Men and Women in their 20s' agenda through an automated text classification algorithm. We, then, examined the effect of agenda attributes on three gender frames: gender issue analysis frame, gender representation frame, and gender conflict frame, and found that among the agenda attributes of 'Men and Women in their 20s', the female-policy agenda attribute 'female quota system', the male-social agenda attribute 'man-hating controversy', and the male-policy agenda attribute 'soldier meals' had a significant positive effect on the use of gender conflict frame. Moreover, at the agenda attribute level, only the female-policy attribute was positively correlated with the gender conflict frame, unlike other agenda attributes, suggesting that women-oriented policy issues tend to be limited to social conflict and controversy. On the other hand, when it comes to the relationship between agenda attributes and gender representation frame, we found that the 'Men in their 20s' are represented as a group attacking feminism and a far-right populist image, while the 'Women in their 20s' are represented as a socially vulnerable group such as victims of crime and a group opposing discrimination against women. We also found that the new media reported male-policy agenda attributes, such as the 'soldier meals' topic, or female-policy agenda attributes, such as the 'female quota system' topic, in a gender-conflicted manner, turning the issue into a kind of gender confrontation by associating election promises for young people with a specific gender. The theoretical contribution of this study is that it examined the relationship between news agendas and gender-related frames based on attribute agenda-setting theory and frame theory, and explored a research method that combines topic modeling and supervised machine learning at the research methodological level.",오다슬,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108634680
유튜브 인플루언서의 사과 영상 내용분석 : 메시지 전략과 비언어적 커뮤니케이션을 중심으로,"This study sought to gain insights into effective crisis communication strategies through an analysis of the growing trend of apology videos among YouTube influencers who are constantly facing intense competition to gain and retain subscribers. Specifically, this study analyzes the content of the messages conveyed by YouTube influencers in their apology videos including image restoration strategies. The study utilized a comprehensive approach to analyzing the apology videos of YouTube influencers, including an examination of how they were represented in their videos, the apology content they used, and how they conveyed their messages. Furthermore, the study looked at nonverbal communication in apologetic videos, such as posture, gaze, and facial expressions. A content analysis method was utilized to sample 61 apology videos from YouTube influencers with over 10,000 followers. The findings revealed that all apology videos included a mortification strategy, followed by a corrective action strategy, an evading responsibility strategy, a reducing offensiveness strategy, and a denial strategy. The apology topics primarily centered on problematic situations raised by viewers or society as a result of inappropriate behavior, with the apology directed towards viewers and the follow-up action given by YouTube influencers focusing on self-improvement. This study found that apology videos predominantly admitted fault or expressed remorse, with few asking the forgiveness or offering compensation. This implies that the apologetic content was designed to keep the influencers’ relationship with their followers, which is critical to their success. Influencers frequently appeared in dark costumes and apologized in a studio setting without music in apology videos. They also commonly employed editing techniques but avoided utilizing black thumbnails. These decisions can be seen as an attempt to demonstrate sincerity and responsibility to their audience. Among the nonverbal signals observed in the apology videos, passive posture was the most frequently displayed, followed by gaze avoidance and sad expression. Male YouTube influencers tended to employ more gaze avoidance compared to females. Results from examining the relationship between image restoration strategies and public responses revealed that when both mortification and denial strategies were used together, the subsequent videos uploaded after the apology video received fewer views and likes compared to when denial strategies were not employed. Additionally, when apology videos incorporated both mortification and corrective action strategies, the view count was higher compared to when these strategies were not utilized together. Finally, the relationship between the inclusion of nonverbal signals in videos and public responses showed that videos with more passive posture had fewer or no decrease in the number of likes for subsequent videos uploaded after the apology video and those with more gaze avoidance had fewer views for the apology video. Based on these findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",송다은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108634681
위기 시 유튜버의 사전 명성과 베스트 댓글이 사과의 진정성 인식과 지속 시청 의도에 미치는 영향: 유튜브 인플루언서의 뒷광고 사례를 중심으로,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of influencers on the public in a crisis, focusing on the recent issues of undisclosed advertisements. In this experimental study, a YouTube influencer apologizes for his faults to the public in the situation of not disclosing the sponsorship in advertising posts. Considering the type of prior reputation and best comment, it was made up of between-groups design of 2(Prior reputation: CA vs CSR) X 2(Best reply valence: positive vs negative) X 2(Best reply strength: strong vs weak). The results of the study showed that the effect of YouTuber's prior reputation did not show any significant difference on the perception of the authenticity of apology. In addition, the main effect of best reply valence was statistically meaningful and the social conformity effect was significant, but there was no influence of the best reply strength. The interaction effect among prior reputation, valence and strength of the best replies was found to be statistically significant. As a result of verifying whether the recognition of the authenticity of the apology and the intention to accept the apology mediate between the independent variable and the continuous viewing intention, the complete mediating effect of the recognition of the authenticity of the apology was confirmed. In the case of the best reply valence and interaction term between independent variables and continuous viewing intentions, there was a complete double mediation of perception of authenticity of apology and the intention to accept the apology. In the case of the best reply strength, the partial double-mediation effect was confirmed. The results of this study provide not only academic significance in that the research was conducted based on a PR perspective through best replies in which prior reputation and conformity effect were confirmed in crisis situations, but also practical implications for crisis response communication of YouTube influencers.",이성주,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108098739
디지털 가짜뉴스에 대한 청소년의 확증 편향 연구 : 경북지역 고등학생을 중심으로,"This study analyzed the confirmation bias of adolescents exposed to fake news. In other words, it examined whether the adolescents who had a strong negative perception of North Korea and those who had a strong positive perception had changed to strengthen their own views after being exposed to fake news about North Korea. The results of the study are as follows. First, the confirmation bias of a group with a negative perception of North Korea has only a limited effect on the consumption of fake news with negative content. Second, the confirmation bias of a group with a positive perception of North Korea had no effect on the consumption of fake news with negative content. Rather, perception shifts in the opposite direction of confirmation bias.
Previous studies have argued that those exposed to fake news have a confirmatory biased news consumption pattern. That is, news consumers accept fake news that enhances their existing perception and ignore fake news that is not. This meant that the impact of fake news could be limited. However, according to this study, a study of adolescents showed that those with unstable recognition tools could not ignore fake news that weakened their existing perception, but rather changed their existing perception under the influence of fake news. The significance of this study is that adolescents have found that the impact of fake news can be much stronger than that of adults.",안태준,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106644098
한국 언론의 저출산 담론의 구성: 동아일보와 경향신문의 ‘저출산’ 보도를 중심으로,"The Korean government has been making long-term responses to the problem of low fertility by establishing the Basic Plan for a Low-Fertility and Older Society every five years since 2006, but the trend of low fertility is intensifying. Under these circumstances, this paper aims to reveal which discourses on fertility have been mainstreamed and which have been marginalized in the Korean media over the past two decades. To this end, we analyzed the frequent words that appeared in the 'low birthrate' reports of two representative mainstream newspapers, the Dong-A Ilbo and the Kyunghyang Shinmun, and conducted a textual analysis of the main opinion articles in which these words appeared. The results showed that the issue of low birthrate was covered most frequently around 2018, when the total fertility rate dropped to less than 1. In contrast, policy coverage was not particularly active during the years when the new basic plan was announced or the presidential election. In terms of the keywords and content that were actively covered in both newspapers, the Dong-A Ilbo emphasized private participation in solving the low birthrate problem from the beginning, and was critical of the free childcare debate. The Kyunghyang Shinmun, in common with the Dong-A Ilbo, covered jobs as the most important issue from the beginning, and in that context, it tended to focus on the poor economic conditions of the younger generation, unlike the Dong-A Ilbo, which emphasized economic revitalization. Over time, both media have tended to reiterate the traditional discourse of emphasizing economic factors, despite the complexity of the problem's causes and solutions. This study suggests that Korean mainstream media need to pay attention to the multilayered aspects of the declining birthrate and present more diverse diagnoses and solutions.",허윤철,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108665753

This study focused on AI speakers, which can help the physical and mental health care of the elderly, and aimed to investigate functional and emotional evaluation of AI speakers through a survey of elderly users. The study found that elderly people living alone were more likely to use AI speaker than ordinary senior citizens and more favorably evaluated it in terms of emotion.
Women also evaluated AI speaker’s emotional aspects more positively than men. For functional evaluations, there was no difference between type of residence and gender.

In addition, the purpose of this study was to confirm the effect of these motivational factors on Facebook and TikTok's advertising attitude, advertising acceptance intention, and sharing intention, respectively. In addition, the mediating effect of social media familiarity was also verified in the influence relationship between advertising attitude and advertising acceptance intention.
As a result of the study, it was found that the 'self-identity' factor influences advertising attitudes of TikTok users. Facebook users found that 'social interaction' and 'entertainment information' influence advertising attitudes, and 'entertainment information' was found to have a higher influence than 'social interaction'. Second, it was found that advertising attitude had an effect on advertising acceptance intention. Third, it was found that advertising attitude had an effect on sharing intention.

In a situation where the metaverse market is booming, interest in the metaverse continues to grow, but the fun factor of continued use of the metaverse is underestimated. Therefore, this study aims to quantify the fun factors that users pay attention to in the game-based metaverse platform and to reveal them through data analysis. To this end, a survey was conducted to collect users who used game-based metaverse applications as research subjects. Through sensory fun, challenging fun, imaginative fun, social interaction fun, and presence, the relationship between user satisfaction and continuous use intention is identified. As a result of the empirical analysis, sensory fun, challenging fun, fun of social interaction, and presence of games increase users’ satisfaction with use and intention to continue using, and it can be seen that the satisfaction with use increases as consumers feel involved. By utilizing the metaverse game platform, consumers can increase their intention to continue using when they feel immersed. This study hopes that it will be meaningful by understanding the fun of game-based metaverse platform users, identifying users’ fun needs, and providing theoretical and practical implications for improving satisfaction and continuous use.",유우새,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108529664
