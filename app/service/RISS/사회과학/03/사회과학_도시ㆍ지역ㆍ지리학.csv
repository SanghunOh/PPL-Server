As competition between live commerce platforms intensifies, many of them attempt to find a new way to attract MZ generation clients that most businesses should aim for their future success.
In order to explore the consumption trends of the MZ generation, this study analyzes several cases of content commerce, a new form of live commerce, which combines live commerce with web content such as drama series, reality show, and game show. Focusing on the main characteristics of the MZ generation, the selected texts are reviewed in terms of four core features of content commerce including entertainment elements, interactivity, the ambivalence of consumption behavior, and gender attributes in consumer culture. The result illustrates the ways in which MZ generation customers actively pursue the pleasure of shopping and getting customer benefit while enjoying high-quality entertainment contents. This study looked at how the new consumption culture centered on content commerce fits the emotions and values of the MZ generation and how they are responding to existing problems in society.",이소현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108589473

일본 후쿠시마 원전 오염수 방류 관련 국제공조 방안,"In April 2011, the Japanese government decided to release 1.25 million tons of radioactively contaminated water from the Fukushima accident nuclear power after filtering system(ALPS) over 30 years from April 2023.
Since tritium and other radioactive contaminants cannot be filtered out by ALPS, released contaminant into the ocean inveitably endanger the safety of food and living environment for citizens of neighboring countries. While radioactive contamination affects the safety of citizens over a wide and long period of time, international legal system is not efficient enough to response to the threat of nuclear material on behalf of the safety and interests of innocent citizens.
The goal of this study is to develop an effective response plan that Gyeonggi-do as a local government can prepare for the safety of citizens when Japanese government actually release radioactively contaminated water.
This study suggests Gyeonggi-do to establish the “East Asia Nuclear Safety Regime” as the final goal in the frame of the urban diplomacy of the local government to promote nuclear safety of citizens. Considering nuclear safety hazards such as the rapidly increasing nuclear power generation facilities on the east coast of China and the occurrence of earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula, a nuclear safety community will be an essential part for East Asian countries. It is time to prepare an international nucelar safety regime with local governments and civil activist groups as major participants.",이성우,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108342779
"미국, 이스라엘, 그리고 이스라엘-팔레스타인 평화 전망 모델","The United States and Israel have formed a special relationship, and they have exercised dominant influence over the Palestinian region based on superior strength. However, the prospect for achieving peace in the Palestinian region remains distant, and as demonstrated by terrorist acts such as the 9.11 incident, the conflict in the region continues to play a strong factor in escalating tension in the world. Based on these facts, one could conclude that the Palestinian region cannot achieve peace without significant changes on the part of the United States and Israel. Therefore, as a Prospect Model for Peace in the Palestinian region, this research attempts to analyze changes in America's Middle-East policies and Israel's reactions to them. The Obama Administration is trying to switch its role to that of a Middle-Course Mediator, thus bringing fresh hope for peace in Palestine. The newly adopted Mediator role will face for much resistance and create conflict within Israel; however, it will contribute to bringing peace in the Palestinian region through cooperation in the international community and other Muslim countries. The implementation of the Middle-Course Mediator role is being delayed as it faces internal resistance and fierce opposition from Israel. Israel is inducing policies that favor itself, as it always has. President Obama himself acknowledged difficulties in achieving his initial objectives in promoting peace in the region. The Obama Administration's successful promotion of peace in the region depends on whether it can act as an unbiased mediator while simultaneously securing its national interests and successfully dealing with the numerous obstacles it currently faces. Also, as the international community points out, it is a task that will take significant amount of time.","윤형호(Yoon, Hyeong-Ho)",2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82363753

MZ세대의 행복 분위에 따른 도시특성 및 요인 분석: M세대와 Z세대의 비교를 중심으로,"In the situation where interest in the MZ-generation has become a social issue, this study has utilized the Seoul Survey data to understand the characteristics of the MZ-generation residing in Seoul and the urban characteristics and factors that affect their level of happiness. We have divided the MZ-generation into the M-generation and Z-generation considering the cohort differences and analyzed and compared the groups by quartiles using the Quantile Regression Model. The analysis results showed that the level of happiness of the MZ-generation (scored 1-50) was 31.65 points, lower than the median, and both the levels of M-generation and Z-generation showed low scores of 31.68 and 31.55 points, respectively. Based on the quantile regression analysis results, this study has identified the urban characteristics that positively or negatively affect the happiness of the MZ-generation. Subsequently, the study has separated M and Z generations, and has found the urban factors that only emerged in the M-generation and the urban factors that only emerged in the Z-generation. When comparing MZ-generations as generations, the study has found that the urban characteristics and factors affecting happiness are different between MZ-generations. This study has divided the levels of happiness into quartiles (Q1, Q2, and Q3), based on the premise that the affecting factors will differ depending on the level of happiness, which is a multidimensional emotion. The results have shown that there were differences in the factors affecting each quartile. Finally, the results of this study, which empirically identified through the quantile regression model what elements must be satisfied for the MZ-generation to be happy in the city, have provided policy implications for the understanding of the MZ-generation living in Seoul, and creating the urban environment in which the MZ-generation can live happily.",김성아,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639860

First, the existing elderly care system is selective, and it is impossible to provide overlapping support despite the need for services. However, community integrated care was a universal system. Second, the existing care for the elderly lacks health and medical services and services linked to the local community. However, community integrated care provided comprehensive services such as health care, housing, convalescence, care, and welfare. Third, the existing elderly care system is in a situation in which public and private institutions cannot participate in an integrated way. However, in the integrated care of local communities, various public and private organizations were participating together. Fourth, if integrated care in the local community is properly operated, health insurance is expected to generate a certain amount of financial income, so it is necessary to secure financial resources through health insurance support in terms of the beneficiary's burden.

In particular, this study selected three countries, Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, as the ‘most likely case’ to promote governance through the European Neighbourhood Policy among Eastern Partnership countries.
As a result of case analysis through ‘causal process tracing’, it was confirmed that the dynamics of promoting governance in Eastern Partnership countries through European Neighbourhood Policy depended on the unique ‘causal mechanism’ and ‘contextual conditions’ of each case. Above all, the effect of promoting ‘democratic governance’ through EU’s ‘values-based Europeanization’ was rejected without being empirically proven. On the other hand, the hypothesis that the EU’s ‘interests-based Europeanization’ would promote the ‘effective governance’ of Eastern Partnership countries was supported in all cases. In particular, it was found that the promotion of ‘effective governance’ through ‘interests-based Europeanization’ produced unintended consequences that contributed to the regime stability rather than the regime reform of Eastern Partnership countries.",김훈,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108035427
저출산·고령화 시대 한국의 인구 정책에 관한 비판적 고찰,"This study attempts to critically examine Korea’s population policy, which takes for granted the state’s control and intervention for individuals to achieve the goal of increasing the fertility rate, in view of a modern population control. There are three major problems with Korea’s population policy from the 1960s to the present.
First, Korea’s population policy has yet to abandon its nationalistic characteristics. Second, rather than thinking about the fundamental causes of the population growth and decline, the focus is on short-term solutions that can be effective immediately. Third, it is unable to explain why such a policy is necessary because it is trapped in its own purpose of increasing or decreasing the population. The “crisis discourse” that underlies Korea’s population policy is that the continued low fertility will lead to a weakening of the nation’s competitiveness by accelerating the aging of the labor force, and decreasing labor productivity. However, it is necessary to fundamentally reconsider whether a higher fertility automatically increases a potential growth and labor productivity, and whether encouraging childbirths is the only solution to the problem. As an alternative to the above-mentioned problems, this study suggests a shift in the view of nationalistic population control and expanding the policy target from married women. Also, this research recognizes the limitations of the promotion of childbirths in a low fertility and aging society, and proposes active immigration policies and the implementation of population policies that can enhance individual labor productivity.",김수정,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106334222
북유럽 지방소멸 위기와 정책적 대응: 스웨덴 사례를 중심으로,"At the global level, while the phenomenon of low birth rate and aging is evident in developed countries, including Korea, among Nordic countries, the concentration of population in cities is intensifying. In contrast, the trend of population growth continues in Sweden. This article is meant to derive specific implications for Korea's local extinction crisis and policy response by looking over the regional policy characteristics of Sweden. As a result of this study, the influx of immigration, universal welfare, and work-life balance policy affected Sweden's continuous population growth in terms of population policy. The problem of regional imbalance between densely populated areas and declining areas can be addressed at the level of regional policy by multi-level governance between transnational organizations (EU)-public (central-local government)-private (third sector). Decentralization and transfer of responsibility from the public to the private sector have been conducted by responding through third-sector cooperation and stakeholder dialogue mechanisms. As a result, the possibility of regional development and population mobility between regions are presented. To respond to Korea’s low birth rate, aging population, and local extinction of Korea, it is necessary to break away from the current fertility-enhancing population and passive labor market policy. Convergence governance in policy establishment and implementation, cooperative structure among multi-level stakeholders, and active regional policy through participation in designing and implementing long-term and comprehensive procedures of the grassroots 3rd sector will be needed.",장선화,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108601345

However, there has been little evidence that the Starbucks effect actually exists. In this respect, this study conducted the analysis to reveal the locational effect of the Starbucks. In order to examine the location effect of Starbucks, we reviewed the year-end change based on the Starbucks stores opened in Seoul in 2016, through such variables as official land values, floating population, homogeneous business, and heterogeneous business. Each variable data were distributed on a map using GIS, and the changes before and after the opening of Starbucks shops were examined. T-test was used to analyze whether there was a statistically significant difference in the variables before and after entering the shops. Among the variables to be analyzed, big difference was not found. However, some differences were found in such variables as the floating population, the homogeneous business, and some of the heterogeneous business. Nevertheless, the variables shown to be different were also influenced by overall social or commercial effects, leading to the conclusion that it is unclear for them to be the products of “Starbucks effect”.

21세기 미중 경쟁에 대한 신냉전 논쟁과 쟁점 연구,"Is the world entering a new cold war? Analysts and officials in Washington are fretting over worsening tensions between the United States and China and the risks to the world of two superpowers once again clashing rather than cooperating. Trump administration’s China policy may be best described as the approach of a New Cold War. In contrast to the Cold War, however, the relation­ship between the United States and China is not a confrontation between two isolated opposing blocs, but a competition for influence within a globalized international system in which the two powers are highly intertwined economically. The US administration wanted to simplify the bilateral relationship by decoupling with China on all fronts. But that approach entails tremendous costs on both sides. American elites have realized that China is challenging American technological supremacy. The most important element of US-China competition globally is economics and economic capabilities, and not military power and military capabilities, which makes it different from the Cold War.

Methods : IoT-based AI robots were provided to 171 school-aged children with developmental disabilities and their parents for four months, enabling the children to use the robots themselves with their parents. For the following six months, occupational therapy professionals conducted the monitoring including counseling, and education for parents during using the robot. The professional monitoring was provided to the parents by telephone calls every month and text messages at least once a week. To analyze the effectiveness of the robots, a usability test was conducted according to general characteristics right before the professional monitoring period. Additionally, to confirm the effects of the professional monitoring, a satisfaction of robot usage and effectiveness of care test were conducted before and after the monitoring period.
Results : The study confirmed that IoT-based AI robots can be useful devices for the care of school-aged children with developmental disabilities, and there was no difference among the participants’ characteristics (p>.05). Furthermore, significant improvements in satisfaction with robot usage and effectiveness of care were shown after the professional monitoring for six months (p<.05). In particular, the interest, performance, and satisfaction regarding the cognitive program were higher compared to other programs, and they significantly improved even after six months monitoring period (p<.05).
Conclusion : This study confirmed that IoT-based AI robots are effective for the care of children with developmental disabilities. To maximize these effects, we suggest that professional management and supervision by occupational therapists be needed. It is guessed that education and management of using AI robots for people with disability could become a new role for occupational therapists in community-based occupational therapy.",한승협,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108727720

Subjective perception of the physical environment was highest in rural areas. In metropolitan, the social activities were the highest but the social networks were the lowest. In correlation analysis, the physical environment and social networks were negatively related to depression in all regions. And Social activities were negatively related in metropolitan. Regression analysis is; the influence of social activities and social networks was significant in metropolitan. In medium-sized cities and rural areas, it was confirmed that social networks and physical environments had a significant influence on depression among the elderly.

A total of 358 researches were selected from 2000 to 2022, and we also explored 43 Korean studies. Previous studies on urban shrinkage have been consistently and continuously conducted about vacant houses, demographic changes, and economic decline. As a detailed analysis, we analyzed the research topics using the co-occurrence network, the strategic diagram and the sankey diagram. We confirmed studies were conducted mainly in the West, such as the United States and Europe in the early stages, but studies have also been recently conducted in the Asian countries. In particular, the keyword “China” has increased dramatically as of 2020. Most of the Korean studies focus on evaluations of the phenomenon of urban shrinkage and alternative solutions in the urban planning and policy field.
To spread the urban shrinkage debate in the future, it is necessary to consider the fundamental discussion of the shrinkage phenomenon and the diversity of research methodologies.",이민주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739362
폐기물 소각시설의 공간적 영향범위에 관한 연구: 서울시 자원회수시설 사례를 중심으로,"It is generally believed that the location of incineration facilities negatively impacts the nearby housing market due to the emissions of various harmful gases. Specifically, the closer the facilities are, the lower the housing prices. The point to note here is the existence of the limited spatial range that these facilities have influences on housing prices. However, there is a lack of research on how to determine this range precisely. Thus, this paper analyzes the distance of the influence of two incineration facilities on housing prices located in Seoul, Korea using a Hedonic model. The results obtained in the paper are summarized as follows: proximity to incineration facilities can impact housing prices up to a range of 500 to 600 meters for the Gangnam Resource Recovery Facility and 500 to 550 meters for the Yangcheon Resource Recovery Facility. The results imply the significance of establishing a long-term compensation plan that carefully considers the degree and range of impact according to the location of the incineration facilities.",최규일,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639861
지방화 시대의 지역발전과 인재지역할당제 도입의 역할,"This study aims at examining the idea of the regional allocation of high-qualified human resource recruitment with regard to its possibility as a device for endogenous regional development. As far as a new model of regional development in the new era of localization is concerned, it is argued that regional development should be based on the knowledge based economy (or the learning economy) where the humanware vis-a-vis hardware (such as infrastructure) is a key constituent. The paper suggests the three ways of the regional allocation of high-qualified human resource recruitment, among which the most idealistic or effective is the provision by regional governments of regionally-valid certifications for some key occupations such as lawyers, doctors, high-rank local civil servants.",조명래,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3136516
독일 윤데마을의 바이오 에너지 생산체제에 대한 경로이론적 접근,"In the early 2000s, the Institute of Interdisciplinary Sustainable Development at University of Gottingen, Germany, designed a Bioenergy Village Model. The Model was consisted of two major systems: one which can generate electricity using methane gas produced from a mixture of agricultural products and livestock manure and another a heating system based on burning wood chips. The Institute advertised the Model over a hundred villages around the Lower Saxony area and called for applications. After several rounds of introductory meetings and selection, Juhnde was chosen as the first of German bioenergy village to adopt the Model. Beginning from 2001, the systems were complited in 2004. Operating from 2005, the Model has been found to be successful as it was able to provide enough heat and electricity to member households of the village. The Model was found to be sound in economic terms as well as environmental terms. Based on the path dependence theory, this paper investigates the process and the outcomes of the Juhnde Model to draw theoretical and policy implications.","신동호(Shin, Dong-Ho)",2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100561957
중국의 국공합작(國共合作)과 내전(內戰)에서 공산당의 승리요인 연구,"This research is designed as the following. It intends to study the cause of Communist Party's victory during a civil war as well as National and Communist parties' cooperation. which was one of the crucial events duriing modern Chines history.
In the establishment of National and Communist parties section. this research briefly surveys the process of both parties' establishment. and the formation of millitary dictatorship and conflict amongst itself. In the section where National and Communist parties' cooperation is discussed. this study examines both paryies' collaboration as well as disputes among themselves. In the National and Communist parties' civil war section. the developmental process of civil war will be analyzed in order to extract lessons.
The research method used in this study develops this study's theory by applying Mao's contradiction and military ideology. The reason for using this methodlogy is because it establishes a standard to understand modern China by grasping and understanding a sense of value and direction embeded within the process of establishing the People's Republic of China in which Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong competed with one another to acquire popularity. and produced numerous policy in order to gain hegemony over another.
The conclusion of this research shows that the reason for the Communist Party's victory is narrowed into three major reasons. First, the cause of victory based on Mao's contradiction ideology was intended to solve contradictions that are different in quality through mmethods of different quality by conducting thorough analysis on the Mao's idea. Second, Mao's military ideology succeeded in uniflying and gaining support from the people and military by appealing to humanism. which eventually led to its victory over the National Party failed to achieve its popularity rhrough renovating both the state and party's governing systems. and their failure lled to the victory the Communist party that pursued a new order for survival.
Through this research, the author intends to analyze every bit of domestic and foreign policy that has been promoted by modern China by using historical facts. By fully understanding these matters. the author would like to use this research as an opportunity to propose adequate solutions and render flezible responses.",나태종,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104700135
서울시 도시열섬현상 지역의 물리적 환경과 인구 및 사회경제적 특성 탐색,"Urban development and densification have led to the Urban Heat Island Effect, in which the temperature of urban space is higher than the surrounding areas, and the intensity is increasing with climate change. In addition, when the city’s air temperature rises in summer, low-income, elderly population, and socially vulnerable people who have health problems lack the ability to cope with the elevated heat environment. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the urban heat island area of Seoul through Hotspot analysis, which is a spatial statistics technique, and explored physical environments, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of urban heat island effect areas using logistic regression models. This study performed urban heat island hotspot analysis using the average air temperatures of the 423 administrative dongs in Seoul. Analysis results identified that the urban heat islands were concentrated in Jung-gu, Jongno-gu, Yongsan-gu, and Yeongdeungpo-gu. Logistic regression analysis results indicated that urban heat island areas of Seoul were affected by residential floor area ratio, commercial facility floor area ratio, overall floor area ratio, impervious surface ratio, and normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI). In addition, as a result of analyzing the vulnerable area of thermal environment considering the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the heat island area, urban heat island areas of Seoul were significantly associated with the proportion of low-income elderly living alone. The result of this study provided useful insights for urban thermal environmental design and policy development that could improve the thermal environment for the socially disadvantaged urban population.",조혜민,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106545336
고령화는 사회적 문제인가? 복잡성 사고로 이해하는 고령화,"The biggest feature of the global demographic structure in the 21st century will be aging. As the fertility rate decreases and life expectancy increases worldwide, the proportion of the elderly population is increasing rapidly.
This study explored how aging can be reinterpreted through complexity thought, looking at aging as a product of complex demographic changes rather than just a social problem. The main findings are as follows. First, aging is not just an increase in the elderly population, but a combination of long-term and complex demographic factors and the forces of social change. Second, complexity thought provides a perspective of understanding the elderly population in the context of multiplicity, noting that aging is organized differently depending on the times and places, and the situation and positionality of individuals and groups. Third, as a population change, aging is a product of the times produced by human co-evolutionary progress, and can be understood as a very complex and selforganizing social system.",이용균,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739359
IB DP(디플로마) 핵심 과목의 내용과 지역 연계: 제주 국제학교의 사례 검토,"Since the agreement of translating Korean of IB curriculum in April 2019, the movement to adopt of IB Curriculum to public school has been raised based on the Daegu and Jeju Province Education Offices. However, controversy over the adaptation of public school for IB curriculum is still in process. The rationale for approval of the adaptation of the IB curriculum is in descriptive essay evaluation system, fostering convergence skill preparing to the fourth industry era, and the opposite is the possibility of the descriptive essay evaluation system by own operation, and discrepancies with Korea’s regional values. In this paper, the structures of TOK, EE and CAS, the core subjects of IB DP, were analyzed to find the emphasis of locality revealed in the operational guidelines. In addition, we selected Jeju International School, which operates an IB program, to investigate IB DP’s Core activities to determine the degree and type of locality revealed. The results of the IB DP study on locality in the IBDP core subjects are as follow. First, we found operational guidelines emphasizing research and participation in ‘local’ in the IB DP operating guidelines. In the TOK essay, students were able to identify local contents with critical view about Korea’s historical cases, conventional concepts and social phenomena, and in EE, local cases related to global issues have been researched. Finally, CAS confirmed that local was looking at the area as a target of service.",정승모,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106443335
