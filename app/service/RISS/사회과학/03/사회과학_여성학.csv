More specifically, this study examines the following: which individual or organization is specified to be the reason and agent of conflict when discussing gender conflict, whose voice is represented as the elites of discord who explain and criticize gender conflict while leading the discourse, the context of gender conflict shown in reports about gender conflict, who is pointed out as responsible of generating gender conflict, and whether reports of gender conflict focus on relaying the conflict or suggesting an alternative. To do this, this study examined and analyzed news from Chosun Ilbo, Donga Ilbo, and Joongang Ilbo in 2021. As a result, this study reveals that discussion of gender conflict in 2021 took place mostly in political circles and online, and the main speakers of gender conflict issues are a small number of elites of discord such as politicians, online male- dominated communities, Jin JoonGwan etc. Also, those who assume systematic sexual discrimination (such as the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, feminism or feminists) and promote policies preferential to women, which is the premise for reverse male discrimination, are targeted as the main contributor of gender conflict. Those excluded from the discourse of gender conflict are the history of sexual discrimination, discussion of existing sexual discrimination, and the voice of men and women of the real world in their 20s. This study points out the risk of the current gender conflict discourse having a negative effect on solving the social reconstruction crisis that Korea’s society is currently facing, and proposes the necessity of a constructive gender conflict discourse.",홍지아,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108174468
징병제의 여성참여 - 이스라엘과 스웨덴의 사례 연구를 중심으로,"  As a thorough male centered institution, conscription has been a foundation for forming masculinized citizenship and has grown providing basic components of civility around the world. Women have not been vocal on the issue of conscription, while conscription has made huge impact on women""s lives. It has related to women""s working rights, social equality as we can see in the controversy over the additional points system to post-conscripts in South Korea. Also it has been the crucial institution legitimizing women""s dependency by emphasizing the binary concepts: men-protector and women-protected.<BR>  This study focuses on the relationship between women and conscription through the comparison between Israel and Sweden, and tries to look at issues we need to consider in South Korea.<BR>  Female conscription has been sustained around 60 years in Israel. Participation and roles of women in the compulsory military service in Israel is going to be expanded and enhanced. It is not easy and simple to measure the impact of women""s participation in the military since Israel is famous for collectivism, state-centered nationalism and strong religion However, it is not imaginable how women sustain civil membership without participating in conscription in such as a nationalistic and militaristic country.<BR>  In Sweden, where gender equality has reached to a high-level, there is not such a concept that men are more qualified manpower than women in the military. Even though government and political parties agree with the ideological necessity of female conscription, the decreasing size of military troops since the end of cold war demeans its effectiveness. The two countries"" cases leave important points for consideration. First, the expansion of women""s participation and roles in the military is now in trend. Second, conscription can be changed in the matter of how to manage, how to aim and how to implement. Third, whether it is female conscription or women’s participation in conscription, that we need to put in priority and discuss.",권인숙(Insook Kwon),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76442341
「성매매 알선 등 행위의 처벌에 관한 법률」의 개정방향,"The controversy over the effectiveness of The Act on the Punishment of Intermediating in Sex Trade and Associated Acts has been going on since the legislation and enforcement of this law.
Especially in the spring of 2011 the attempts to eradicate sex trade in the red light districts in Yeongdeungpo, mainly led by Seoul metropolitan police agency met with failure because of organized responses and fierce protests from pimps and women involved in sex trade. Their main argument is the law just makes ordinary people criminals and is no use restraining or reducing sex trade industry.
In addition, in December 2012 The Seoul Northern District Court has requested The Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality of the penal provision that punish ‘anyone who (voluntarily) trade sex’. This incident raised issues not only about the effectiveness of law but the invasion of constitutional rights.
But sex trade is fundamentally not the same as general trade because sex trade is very serious human rights violation. So the intermediaries (for typical example, pimps) who gained immense profits from this business and clients who buy sex all deserve to be severly punished, then we shouldn’t deny the need for this law.
After this request of the court anti sex trade agencies anticipate the constitutional court will decide to decriminalize only women(part of providing sex) and on the other hand make much efforts to revise this provision in the direction of decriminalizing women.
By the way the law says ‘victims of the sex trade shall not be subjected to punishment for sex trade’. So Anti sex trade agencies also try to revise the definition of victims of sex trade toward enlarging the concept of victims and rearranging the provisions related to protective procedure for women involved in sex trade during police investigation and trial. This is the second-best solution in preparation for possibilities that the decision of Constitutional Court doesn’t meet our hope or the movement for revision in the direction of decriminalizing women is frustrated.
Also it is necessary to reinforce punishment of a person who intermediate in sex trade and associated acts, employ or recruit another person for the purpose of sex selling, introduce work with knowledge that sex trade occurs and advertise activities or agencies where such activities are carried out above mentioned. And it’s needed to adopt the new penal provision that regulate the advertisement on sex trade through the internet.
This paper is mainly about the revision direction of act on the punishment of intermediating in sex trade and associated acts for the right of women involved in sex trade.",고명진,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99883985
저출산현상의 원인과 대책방향,"Recent research reports that the rapid decline of Korean fertility rate is caused by the increased rate of non-marital status, the rise of average marital age, the settlement of general attitudes towards having less-children, and the increased women`s participation in economic activities. Among them, if we point out the two most important factors, it will be the first two; the increase of young people choosing a single life and postponing their marriage. Contradictory to such reality, the current governmental on-going policies for raising fertility rate is focused on the married women providing birth-subsidy (or birth-gift) to the third-and-after birth or supporting nursing fee if they use day-care centers. According to a statistics, the effect of such policies, however, is expected minimal because the married women have maintained high fertility rate for the past 20 years. Thus, the future solutions for the low-fertility problems should be focused on unmarried young women by driving governmental policies for inducing them not to give up marriage for their work. For this, two suggestions are made; the increase of governmental share in the maternity protection action for working women as measure of minimizing the employers` avoidance of hiring married women and the expansion of public day-care facilities especially for infants making it possible for working mothers to return to workplace right after their maternity leave.",박숙자,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A327033
친밀환상의 작동 방식: 팬플랫폼 ‘버블’ 이용자를 중심으로,"Fan platform “Bubble” is a service in which one-sided message exchange between k-pop idols and fans consists of conversations. Its emergence reinforced the intimacy fantasy of k-pop fandom and, at the same time, exposed the structure. This study attempted to see what emotions and relationships the use of Bubble causes and how it is accepted and managed. To this end, 22 people with experience in using Bubble were interviewed and analyzed. How do people enjoy the unique relationship and conversation in Bubble even though they understand that it is hypothetical? The reasons for it were fantasy and reality being mixed, the sense of intimacy being sensed first and considered more important than the recognition of fantasy, and the possibility of having intimate conversations itself functioning as a fact. The intimate sense felt in Bubble also showed desire and limitation. There was a desire to peek into the privacy of idols and to seek a romantic relationship, but the emotional norms based on fandom and age limited this. These desires, however, have sometimes been tolerated through various strategies and justifications. This paper is significant in that it was able to examine how consumers in the emotional market consume intimacy fantasies and emotions, and how they perceive norms and coordinate them with reality.",이나은,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108174469
한국 국회는 대표의 다양성을 보장하는가?: 비례대표제와 여성할당제의 효과와 한계,"Proportional Representation(PR) has been put forward as the most appropriate electoral institution to realize a democratic and diverse political representation. In South Korea, however, gender-blind discussion of PR and critical feminist discourses on gender quotas have undermined arguments for PR and quotas while showing little understanding of the interplay of the two institutions. This paper examines party lists to examine the features of PR quota women through intersectional analyses of the socio-economic backgrounds of all the members of the 17th to 20th National Assemblies. The findings disclose that PR women embody intersectional diversity better than PR men and representatives of the majoritarian seats. This substantiates the argument that PR and gender quotas in tandem have contributed to securing diversity of representation - however partially - in the National Assembly in South Korea, in spite of institutional constraints created by the small portion of PR seats and opaque candidate selection processes of political parties.",이진옥,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104500515
군가산점제는 어떻게 ‘젠더갈등’의 전선이 되었나? : 병력동원-보상체제의 형성과 동요,"In the past, South Korean men who had completed their compulsory military service had been rewarded with bonus points when they had applied for jobs. In 1999, the Constitutional Court ruled that the compulsory military service incentive system was unconstitutional. Since then, the issue of “rewarding” compulsory military service, including the reintroduction of the extra points system, has become a main conflict issue in South Korean society. When this extra point system was abolished, those subject to military duty compared themselves to women exempt from military service, claiming that they were victims of the unrewarded military service and reverse discrimination. The controversy over this compulsory military service incentive system has turned into a gender antagonism, leading to calls for the introduction of an “equal service system for men and women” and “mandatory military service for women”. Behind the problem of mandatory military service emerging as “gender conflict,” there is the history of the discourse and the institutional practice making military service obligation the basic foundation of citizenship and the best contribution to the nation-state. The establishment of male citizenship based on military duty and the military mobilization and reward system were formed in the process of reorganizing the draft system based on the expanded concept of military service during the Cold War. After the democratization, the differences in national citizens centered on the military service obligation became visible, causing disruption and resistance in the military mobilization and reward system. In this process, the conflict between men and women has intensified over the definition of equality, difference, and discrimination. This “gender conflict” temporarily serves to seal the cracks in the military mobilization and reward system.",강인화,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108534133
공무원시험에서의 제대군인가산점제도를 둘러싼 논의에 관한 검토,"Now the point that the systematic device of introducing political gender Even Though in 1999 constitutional court of korea ruled that the incentives of civil service examination for discharged soldiers is unconstitutional, there have been controversies in connection with this subject. Recently the debate about amendment for the reintroduction of the incentives is hotting up. ‘Proincentives’
argues that the state has to compensate for the military service, and the incentives are not unconstitutional, if their rate and number of times are reduced. However the incentives are actually very little value as a reward for discharged soldiers. Above all constitutional court of korea decided that the incentives were unconstitutional, because it was a constitutional groundless institution and violated fundamental rights of women and disabled persons, futhermore, the rate were too high and the number of times were not limited.
The better and practical reward and support should be provided for the military service instead of unconstitutional incentives. The debate for the valuable support policy has to go on rather than the pros and cons about the incentives. In this article reward and support policy for the military service in germany and singapore are described. It was founded from this study that these countries provide considerable compensation and any other various support for the military service.",박귀천,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82631002
현대가족 변화와 새로운 가족정책 방향,"By analyzing the changes in Korean families, this article aims to explore the direction of family policy. The changes of Korean families are reviewed in terms of their main values, structure, and functions. The Confucian values which had dominated Korean society for a long time have been fading away and the structure of Korean family system has altered rapidly mainly due to the increase of divorce and remarriage. The traditional functions of Korean family as a social welfare system and an institute for child bearing and rearing are weakening while emotional family relationships, in particular between husband and wife are becoming strengthened and important.
The government should provide comprehensive family policy for the family members. The family policy should be a policy for the family itself instead of being a welfare policy through family, and recognize the variety of family structures and promote a democratic family reflecting gender perspectives. In other words, family policy should support the family members who suffer from the rapid changes of values, structure and functions, and encourage them to have democratic and equal relationships.",김경애,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A327030
낙태에 대한 여성의 인식과 태도- 낙태 허용도와 여성의 낙태 결정권을 중심으로 -,"Women entirely have had to burden damage from abortion since the Korean government regulates abortion in 2010. However, women are being forced to keep silence by structure of society because abortion is recognized as a murder or crime in our society. This article represents how women can break the silence and discourse on abortion as main agents. For this purpose, this study analyzed women's awareness and attitudes toward abortion focusing on a degree of acceptance and women’s right to determine abortion. Based on the analysis, women have a relatively receptive awareness and attitudes toward the abortion’s degree of acceptance and women's right to determine abortion. In addition, both the abortion’s degree of acceptance and women's right to determine abortion function as important variables because they have adequacy of explanation. However, women tend not to be free from social stigma of abortion. In the feminist movement, an abortion should be regarded not only as an act of abortion but also as social context and women's human rights. Moreover, it will be necessary to systematically provide opportunities that women can create a discourse of abortion as agents.",김도경,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104862989
청소년의 디지털 성폭력 피해 경험에 관한 내러티브 탐구: 디지털 세계의 폭력적 젠더 질서 속에서 살아남기,"This article examines the adolescents’ experiences of sexual violence in digital media space in the context of gender order. It employs a narrative inquiry to analyze the stories of four youths who experienced digital sexual violence. This study found the following: First, the digital media space is space where youths are at risk of gender-based violence, while simultaneously is a space to form identities, build relationships, resist and learn. Second, the research participants objectify their experience of digital sexual assault as a socio-structural problem, an attack on feminists, or something raunchy and unpleasant. It is a survival strategy they employ to minimize the damage of the violence. Third, only those with available resources and networks can objectify their experience, whereas those disconnected from the discourse cannot. Fourth, digital sexual violence develops into a source of fear when it poses physical threats offline. On these accounts, adolescents‘ survival strategies in a digital space tend to be inadequate to provide safety from violence.
These findings suggest that gender order in digital space needs to be carefully considered to address the issue of digital sexual violence in adolescents. They also imply that institutional and policy-related efforts are required for our society to imagine adolescents as subjects who can express their sexuality.",이혜정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108280083
내 뜻대로 삶 쓰기: 20대 여성의 4B 가치관 형성 과정 연구,"The purpose of this qualitative research is to introduce people who choose to live a 4B(NO dating, NO sex, NO marriage, NO child-bearing) lifestyle, and to understand their experience. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 research participants who live in Seoul, Korea, and its outskirts. All participants said they had firmly “decided to live a 4B life."" Interview data were analyzed through Taylor and Bogdan’s (1984) six-step process. For interviewees, the 4B lifestyle was ""the most basic, personal and fundamental movement to topple the patriarchal system"", and ""the choice made by loving oneself"". In the process of forming 4B values, their experiences related to 'SNS/Online community', 'Escaping from corset', and participation in ‘Uncomfortable Courage Demonstrations' played critical roles.
Through these practical actions, participants experienced solidarity and sisterhood. On the other hand, they acknowledged the ambivalence that comes from the contradiction between one’s personal life limited to neo-liberalism and the practice of 4B life. They were trying to understand the meaning of the affect they felt through the process of self-questioning and interactions with people who share their values. They wanted to see something other than the “uneven playing field” and “collectivization of 4B”. Although they wanted to deliver a message to society through a collective lifestyle, they also wanted to see themselves as individuals, not as a group. With this attitude, they were fulfilling the phrase, ""the personal is political"". Under the blanket identity of a marriage-free and child-free group, there were individual narratives behind choosing 4B as a value and a lifestyle. I wanted to convey the need for an effort to understand and respect their choice of 4B.",강미선,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106930455
여성이주노동자의 노동환경과 건강에 관한 연구: 2020년 이민자 체류실태 및 고용조사를 중심으로,"This study aims to identify the health status of female migrant workers in Korea, and analyze the factors affecting their health. We derived the factors affecting the self-rated health of 5,264 employed female migrants, based on the 2020 Test Survey on Immigrants’ Living Conditions and Labour Force, for this purpose. The result showed that the self-rated health of female migrant workers was above average and generally positive. However, there were differences in health according to their socio-economic characteristics and working environment. In addition, job satisfaction, income satisfaction, working hours, and enterprise size affected the health of female migrant workers. This implied a health gap, depending on socio-economic characteristics and working environment among female migrant workers. The study’s results have the following implications. It is necessary to guarantee working conditions for female migrant workers through stable employment, examine the company's characteristics in a multidimensional way, improve their labor satisfaction by increasing awareness, and develop a measurement tool for a more specific and in-depth understanding of their health.",김나경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108567330
맞벌이 남성과 여성의 배우자 지지 및 일-가정 양립 촉진적 자기와 심리적 안녕감의 관계: 일-가정 향상의 매개효과,"The purpose of this study was to identify the mediating effect of work-family enrichment when spousal support and work-family reconciliatory self affect psychological well-being. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with a sample of 328 married dual-income adults aged 30 to 40. The findings from the study are summarized as follows: First, spousal support and work-family reconciliatory self contributed to increasing psychological well-being through family-to-work enrichment(FWE). Second, two paths in gender difference were identified: 1. spousal support to work-to-family enrichment(WFE). 2. work-family reconciliatory self to work-to-family enrichment(WFE). Third, spousal support and work-family reconciliatory self of both male and female groups increased psychological well-being through family-to-work enrichment(FWE). However, there was no mediating effect on the path of spousal support and work-family reconciliatory self to psychological well-being through work-to-family enrichment(WFE) in both male and female groups. Based on these findings, implications for counseling and study limitations were discussed.",김지민,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108490465
남성의 육아휴직 사용은 돌봄의 탈젠더화를 촉진할 것인가?: 2010년대 중반 이후 남성 육아휴직자의 경험을 중심으로,"This study examines the implications of fathers’ use of parental leave for changes in gender relations in Korea by in-depth interviews with men who have taken parental leave since the mid-2010s. In a trend where the expansion of fathers’ leave has impacted encouraging fathers’ involvement in childcare, this study analyzes whether fathers’ use of parental leave will be an opportunity to introduce the degenderization of care and ‘caring masculinity.’ Fathers who have taken parental leave shared housework before parental leave because their spouses were those with high income and job security. Moreover, they did not want to sacrifice their family life for promotion and distanced themselves from the gender stereotype that childcare was a woman’s job. However, only men whose spouses and grandparents could not participate in care could use parental leave, and most of them were unable to continue caring after returning to their jobs. Furthermore, the meaning of care during parental leave was usually focused on an opportunity to build close relationships with their children. Therefore, the expansion of fathers’ parental leave-taking did not mean the degenderizaion of care and ideal worker norm and gender inequality in the labor market should be changed.",정수빈,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108081608
유아 부모를 위한 성교육프로그램 개발 및 효과 분석,"The purpose of this study was to enhance sensitivity of sexuality on a view of sex equity and to develop a sexuality education program for parents with children in early childhood to help them give effective sexuality education appropriate for the developmental stages of their children, and to verify the effect of the program. Based on earlier studies and references, the investigator developed eight hours program. The program included not only the knowledge and techniques for parents to give sexuality education to their children, but also the orientation towards the values of respect for life and human, and includes the content about the concepts of sexuality and sexuality education, the comprehension of sexual development in early childhood, safe sex instructions, and gender equality education. To analyze the effects of the program, the study divided 53 parents with young children from three kindergartens in Gyeonggi Province into the experiment group(26) and the control group(27). The pre- and post-test results of their sex knowledge, sex attitude, and parent efficacy show that the experiment group made a statistically significant increase. The investigator also analyzed their reviews and discovered their changes that met the developmental goals of the program. Those findings indicate that the development direction and contents of the sexuality education program developed in the study was effective for increasing their sex knowledge, making positive changes to their sex attitude, and improving their parent efficacy for sexuality education for young children among the parents with children in early childhood. The findings also provided implications for sexuality education for parents with young children.",이은경,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104861933
성별화된 위험이 야기하는 존재론적 불안 : 청년여성의 자살생각 내러티브를 중심으로,"This study investigates the factors contributing to suicidal ideation among young women, particularly in the context of a rising suicide rate in South Korea. Analyzing narratives from 18 individuals who experienced suicidal thoughts during the past year, it uncovers gendered risks associated with labor, family dynamics, and caregiving responsibilities. These risks, influenced by the governmentalities of neoliberalism and patriarchy, are often individualized rather than recognized as structural concerns. Despite efforts to embrace feminist discourse and shape their own trajectories, societal norms continue to relegate young women to secondary roles in the labor force. As the institution of marriage transitions to being elective as opposed to obligatory, the potential risks associated with work, familial responsibilities, and caring intersect with the prospect of a solitary life. This convergence intensifies the gendered risks, generating existential anxiety. The perception of insurmountable circumstances is a contributing factor to suicidal ideation. In conclusion, this study highlights the complex interplay of gendered risks, emphasizing the role of societal structures in exacerbating vulnerabilities and underlining the need for comprehensive interventions to address these challenges.",이소진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108758445
