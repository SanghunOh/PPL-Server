"미국, 이스라엘, 그리고 이스라엘-팔레스타인 평화 전망 모델","The United States and Israel have formed a special relationship, and they have exercised dominant influence over the Palestinian region based on superior strength. However, the prospect for achieving peace in the Palestinian region remains distant, and as demonstrated by terrorist acts such as the 9.11 incident, the conflict in the region continues to play a strong factor in escalating tension in the world. Based on these facts, one could conclude that the Palestinian region cannot achieve peace without significant changes on the part of the United States and Israel. Therefore, as a Prospect Model for Peace in the Palestinian region, this research attempts to analyze changes in America's Middle-East policies and Israel's reactions to them. The Obama Administration is trying to switch its role to that of a Middle-Course Mediator, thus bringing fresh hope for peace in Palestine. The newly adopted Mediator role will face for much resistance and create conflict within Israel; however, it will contribute to bringing peace in the Palestinian region through cooperation in the international community and other Muslim countries. The implementation of the Middle-Course Mediator role is being delayed as it faces internal resistance and fierce opposition from Israel. Israel is inducing policies that favor itself, as it always has. President Obama himself acknowledged difficulties in achieving his initial objectives in promoting peace in the region. The Obama Administration's successful promotion of peace in the region depends on whether it can act as an unbiased mediator while simultaneously securing its national interests and successfully dealing with the numerous obstacles it currently faces. Also, as the international community points out, it is a task that will take significant amount of time.","윤형호(Yoon, Hyeong-Ho)",2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82363753

일본 사회의 매뉴얼과 ‘보통’의 삶에 대한 고찰 - 편의점 인간 을 통해 본 사토리 세대의 고민,"This study is intended to analyze the characters and events described in the novel “Convenience Store Woman”(“CSW”) written by Sayaka Murata, for the better understanding of the Satori generation in Japanese society. CSW depicts the personal and also common problems that youth of the Satori generation faces in the modern society. A community or society is a network that can be established only when individuals are connected to each other. This novel connects such individuals with literary imagination and binds them into a single community.
The author will trace the worries about a “manual for life”, centering on the main character Furukura. By analyzing the perceptions and differences of the people around her through events related to their occupations and marriages, and examining the meaning of the protagonist’s choice in the latter part of the novel, it is expected to reconsider the ethical judgment and values for an “Normal” life.
The “manual for life” consists of what we conventionally believe “normal people” should have in their lives - for example, job, spouse and family. The characters in this novel aspire to a “normal” life defined in the “manual for life” - a life where they have “a regular job, a spouse, and a baby”, while Furukura wants to live a “normal” life because what she really desires is keeping a relationship with her family and friends, not the life everyone else are longing for. At the end of the novel, her choices change as she decides to live for her own happiness.
Furukura, the protagonist of CSW, gives up a job interview for a steady job and concludes that her purpose in life is to be a “Convenience Store Woman”, a part-time worker at a convenience store. Her choices have been oriented toward maintaining an identity acceptable to family or friends around her, but at the end of novel, she now thinks her happiness as a top priority in her life. Furukura’s decision to be a “Convenience Store Woman” is a rejection of conventional wisdom in Japanese society, and also a question about what a “normal” or “ordinary” life is. Hence, understanding the Satori generation will give an opportunity to think about how the conditions to lead our lives are changing with insight of the multi-layered society",신현선,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108075315

The conclusions of the study are as follows. First, in terms of the total population structure, the population growth rate is decreasing, and the proportion of the working-age population aged 15-64 is decreasing. Second, the rural population is decreasing significantly, and in particular, the size of the potential farmer aged 0-14 has decreased significantly. Third, in terms of the demographic structure within the peasantry, the growth rate of the peasantry. Third, in terms of the population structure inside the Nongmingong, the growth rate of the Nongmingong is decreasing, and among them, the proportion of the new generation of the Nongmingong and the proportion of the elderly Nongmingong is increasing.
The implications of this study are as follows. First, the deepening of Mingonghuang phenomenon will make it difficult to obtain labor in the labor market. . Second, as Mingonghuang phenomenon intensifies, labor costs will continue to increase.",김경환,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108250319
K-pop이 일본 대중문화에 미친 영향에 대한 연구 : 일본 아이돌계를 중심으로,"Japan has been regarded as an essential market for overseas expansion of K-pop. Also, in fact, K-pop idol groups are gaining great popularity, mainly among the younger generations in Japan. As the younger generations(especially girls, middle and high school students), who are the main consumers of the idol industry among Japanese, have become more interested in Korean K-pop idols, which are different from existing Japanese idols. For example like BTS, Blackpink, Twice became famous among Japanese younger generations. As such, K-pop has become a large part of the Korean Wave culture industry targeting Japan. Meanwhile, the popularity of K-pop in Japan has led to a major change in Japanese pop culture, especially Japanese idol culture. First, the popularity of the Japanese members among K-pop idol groups has led Japanese younger generations to become interested in Korean idol. Second, many young Japanese generations have challenged the audition program to become a K-pop idol. Third, Japanese entertainment companies have also actively accept the K-pop success factor and K-pop style performance to their J-pop idol groups. To study these phenomena, this paper attempts to analyze how the popularity of K-pop influenced Japanese idol business based on cultural communication. Therefore, this study is developed as follows. First of all, after looking at cultural communication, which is the theoretical basis of the research. Second, how did the K-pop group, which possess Japanese member in there group, influenced Japanese idol culture. Third, how did Japanese younger generations challenged K-pop.

외국인 유학생 유치 및 관리 방안 연구,"Today, when the era of internationalization is progressing rapidly, major countries around the world are making various efforts to attract foreign students, and the Korean government is no exception. This is because there are great national benefits that can be expected through attracting foreign students. According to the increasingly poor and rapidly changing educational environment, such as a decrease in educational demand due to a decrease in the school-age population and a contraction in university finances due to a freeze in tuition fees, universities are seeking survival strategies while strengthening their competitiveness through internationalization. As part of this, universities are competitively attracting foreign students through various methods, and various support programs are planned and implemented so that international students can settle down well. Based on the PUSH-PULL theory, this study analyzed social, cultural, and historical backgrounds at the national level as transmission factors of Mongolian, Vietnamese, and Chinese international students attending C University. Based on this, three suggestions were made to establish an efficient foreign student attraction and management system by analyzing the current status of international students. First, strategic international students and diversification of international students.",이길연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108049737
의료기관의 감염병 관리 대응체계 현황,"This study investigated organizations, regulations, education and manpower, and isolation facilities for responding to infectious diseases by type of medical institution to confirm the response system for infectious diseases of medical institutions. Tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals, and long-term care hospitals across the country were targeted for the study, and a total of 104 institutions (20 tertiary hospitals, 53 secondary hospitals, and 31 long-term care hospitals) participated. Infection control staff filled out a questionnaire on the general characteristics of their medical institutions (3 questions), and their organization (8 questions), regulations (3 questions), education and manpower (12 questions), and isolation rooms (14 questions) for infectious disease control. The difference in the infectious disease management response system by type of participating medical institution were analyzed using chi-square test. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that tertiary hospitals have well-equipped organizations, regulations, manpower, and isolation facilities to respond to infectious diseases, while some secondary hospitals or long-term care hospitals, where with high risk of outbreak due to the substantial number of elderly patients, lack an infectious disease management response system. Since infectious disease patients can occur anywhere regardless of the size of medical institutions, it is necessary to guide small hospitals and long-term care hospitals to have an organization, manpower, and facility system to respond to infectious diseases. In addition, the rapid response of infectious disease response personnel with appropriate capabilities is an important factor in preventing the inflow and spread of infectious diseases into medical institutions. Accordingly, not only should medical institutions voluntarily make efforts to systematize infectious disease response education, prepare an organizational system of medical institutions, and strengthen facilities, but also related government ministries, academia, and organizations need to make various support and efforts together.",차경숙,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108407592

To this end, first, in order to find the most suitable research model, the non-change model, the linear change model, and the secondary change model set as an unconditional model were compared, and the linear change model was adopted as the most suitable model. Second, the adopted research model was applied to confirm the longitudinal change in career maturity subject to the experience of the semi-free semester system. The analysis results are as follows. First, in the adopted model, students' career maturity increased significantly as time increased, and the rate of change varies depending on the initial value of individual career maturity. Second, it was found that the experience of the semi-free semester system did not affect the change in students' career maturity. These results imply that career education in Daegu may have significantly increased students' career maturity, while suggesting that it is necessary to review whether career education is being properly conducted in semi-free semester system.",장휘창,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108589486
‘혐한’ 현상 앞에 선 재일문학- 최실의 『지니의 퍼즐』과 황영치의 『전야』를 중심으로 -,"This study addresses the aspect of Zainichi Korean literature facing the serious ‘anti-Korean’ phenomenon multilaterally by renewing the interpretation of Jini’s Puzzle and closely examining The Night Before.
The ‘anti-Korean’ phenomenon of Japanese society began around the 2000s and has been a motive for Zainichi Korean literature to discuss ‘serious’ matters, such as ‘ethnicity,’ ‘ideology,’ and ‘nationality,’ as literary themes. Whereas young writers in the 1990s like Yu Miri and Kaneshiro Kazuki avoided these themes or handled them with a very ‘soft’ feeling, new Zainichi-Korean writers who appeared after 2010 illustrate the world as a space full of ‘seriousness.’ Among them, The Night Before by Hwang Yeong-chi and Jini’s Puzzle by Che Sil focus on the Zainichi Korean protagonists who struggle to find solutions to the ‘anti-Korean’ phenomenon. These works draw attention by embodying the reality of ‘serious’ Zainichi Korean society in the front line. The former reveals diverse desire structures of Japanese society entwined with the ‘anti-Korean’ phenomenon through the protagonist, who directly confronts hate demonstrations. The latter sheds light on the irrational reality faced by Zainichi Korean society through scars of the protagonist who experiences exclusion and discrimination at school.
The differences in the view of the ‘anti-Korean’ phenomenon between the two works show that Zainichi Korean society is bearing a very complex issue. However, Zainichi Koreans have been seeking literary solutions to ‘unsolvable’ problems surrounding their reality ever since the 1950s, when Japan was regarded as a place for settlement. The important fact is that Zainichi Korean literature still pays attention to the ‘unknown’ aspect of Zainichi Korean society and its members, which will be continued in the future.",이승진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107017046
기후환경변화와 아프리카의 미래,"Recently the world is focusing on the issue of ‘climate change’. In particular the problems of COVID-19, climate change, resource depletion and global inequality have become very serious. There is an urgent need for a transformative response from the international community in this regard. In recent years the world has gone through a climate crisis from climate change, and now the intensity and awareness of the crisis are increasing enough to use the word ‘Climate Disaster’ without hesitation.
Meanwhile global temperature rise, drought, large-scale floods, earthquakes, soil degradation and desertification are all factors that increase violence and conflict. Disruptions caused by such changes in the climate environment have now become commonplace, and population growth is already exceeding the limit of water use and putting a burden on food supply. In addition there is a threat to survival due to the risk of random terrorism and they are facing a catastrophic level of crisis due to migration to obtain food. However the world is not responding sufficiently to the climate change which is the worst crisis. Although problems due to climate change are already appearing in many regions of the African continent, they are in a difficult situation to solve due to problems related to politics.
It will be meaningful to find out whether it is possible to overcome such climate change through analysis of the relationship between human history and civilization. Therefore, in this thesis, I will consider climate change, human society and global warming and climate change in Africa. It is intended to examine whether global warming can be overcome by human will rather than discussing climate change in general.
It is difficult to respond because various risk factors such as infectious diseases, climate change, rapid automation, financial collapse, rising real estate prices and geopolitical tensions are rapidly appearing in the world. However it is important for us to cooperate closely and enhance management and cooperation with nature to respond to changes in the climate environment. Only the government's exclusion of individualism including nationalism, human greed, restoration of the creative order, and social sanctification can cause changes in the Earth's climate environment.",장훈태,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108183916
막스 베버(Max Weber)에 있어 관료제 통제의 제 측면들,"Weber's social science discussion is focused on finding the logic of development of Western modern society. The key concept that differentiates society between pre-modern society and modern society is rationality. In terms of politics, Western modern society is distinguished in that rationality was achieved as the modern state, especially the bureaucracy, was established. Bureaucracy is based on law and operates under rules such as formal recruitment, salary, pension, promotion professional training and authority, and documented procedures. This bureaucracy is inseparable from popular democracy as it treats everyone the same as the implementation of formal rationality. However, the rationality of these bureaucracy can lead to conflicting results with democracy due to the paradox of rationality in which bureaucrats seek their own power, which takes administration out of political control.
In order to overcome these problems, Weber suggested a leader democracy and a strong parliament, where politicians can cooperate while controlling the administration. Although Weber himself did not directly mention it, this paper attempts to suggest that Weber's own alternative lies in political education on the premise in order to be realized in detail. As the basis for this, Weber mentioned that for the election of leaders by popular vote, the public's ability to select political leaders with charismatic qualities is necessary, and in his professor’s inauguration speech, the ultimate goal of his study was political education. In addition, Weber assumed the bourgeoisie and proletariat, that is, members of the political community, as the subject of such political education, and mentioned their political maturity and the qualities necessary for those who want to make politics their profession and vocation.
Weber's discussion has clear implications for the current Republic of Korea, which is criticized as a bureaucratic republic after democratization and has high distrust of the parliament and politicians. In other words, it is necessary to reflect on the meaning of political education in terms of nurturing politicians with political qualities to control bureaucrats and improving the public's ability to demand and choose politicians with such political qualities.",김경래,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108284699
관광 빅데이터와 인공지능 기술을 활용한 스마트관광 활성화 방안 제언 : 강원지역 사례를 중심으로,"The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the tourism industry and prompted social evolution, resulting in a shift in the tourism paradigm, a sharp movement to the online market related to technology, the growth of remote businesses, and changes in the platform business-oriented industrial structure. Tourism in the post-COVID era must accept these changes to achieve competitiveness, and evolution is required to strengthen competitiveness and advancement. The world is committing to strengthening industrial competitiveness using big data and artificial intelligence. In line with this trend, tourism is also increasingly demanding a new strategy through a digital transformation of the existing tourism industry that actively utilizes cutting-edge technology. This paper presents problems and policy solutions by analyzing the current status and case studies of smart tourism, the current status of open tourism data in Gangwon, and the conditions of consumers and suppliers in the tourism industry. First, in terms of infrastructure development, we emphasize the need for “digitalization” in revitalizing smart tourism in Gangwon-do to develop infrastructure and recommend the construction of a data distribution platform, the collection of high-quality tourism big data, and the development of a big data collection and analysis system to stimulate smart tourism based on the tourism big data.Second, we propose to improve accessibility by applying information and communication technology to tourism content, such as augmented reality, virtual reality, artificial intelligence (AI), and metaverse, to expand tourism content in response to consumer trends. Third, we propose the development of customized AI models for tourism consumers in Gangwon, the operation and gradual expansion of smart tourism by designating tourist hot spots in Gangwon, and the establishment of a sustainable global AI-tourism research and development ecosystem. The findings of this study are expected to serve as reference materials for developing practical business strategies for institutions and managers who plan and implement smart tourism.",장원중,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108572095
‘질병’의 사회적 삶: 미나마타병의 계보학,"The theme of this manuscript is to review the history of Minamata disease in Japan, which is well known as a major environmental pollution disease, to reconstruct the history of the disease from a social constructive perspective, and to reflect on meanings of laws and lawsuits around the disease in the age of bio-political governmentality. By taking the social constructionist point of view, I conjure the whole process of the acts and conflicts of the various agents who have been acting in all arenas surrounding the Minamata disease, encompassing local residents, medical workers who have devoted themselves to determining the cause of the disease and treating it, patients’ associations and support groups, Chisso company that discharged wastewater, the central government, and lawsuits over compensation and recognition of the disease. To this end, this study largely divided the history of Minamata disease into three periods: (1) the birth of the disease, (2) the path to compensation after obtaining the official name of disease, and (3) the struggle for recognition: litigation of the unrecognized patients. This enabled the researcher (or me) to reconstruct the entire history of Minamata disease as a ‘social drama’.
The history of Minamata disease shows the pathological structure of Japan’s postwar high capitalism itself, considering the long time it took for the disease to become formally recognized since the outbreak, enormous suffering of patients who had to endure in the process, and the continued lawsuits over recognition of legal responsibility and compensation. Furthermore, this still is an ongoing process, in that similar issues continue to be structurally repeated around the world, as seen in the recent ‘humidifier disinfectant damage’ in Korean society. The primary purpose of looking back at the past history of Minamata disease at this point of time, is to reflect on how the errors caused by ‘the will to know’ around Minamata disease only worsened the problems and identify the possibilities that could have prevented the spread of the disease. Furthermore, an important future research question appears to explore answers to the question: What ‘form of life’ may deal with the process of managing the damages caused by environmental pollutions without taking them to the court of law in the world currently dominated by the bio-political governmentality.",이영진,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107809603
미중간 공급망 경쟁과 시사점,"The purpose of the report is to analyze the intensifying competition between the U.S. and China since the launch of the Biden administration in terms of supply chain competition and to present policy suggestions from the Korean government due to intensifying competition between the two countries.
In 2021, the U.S. and China have been seeking internal and external countermeasures against decoupling, such as enhancing domestic production capacity and strengthening cooperation with the international community, and global supply chain competition is expected to begin in earnest from 2022.
The two countries recognize that the high-tech field will be the core of strategic competition, and accordingly, rather than expanding competition across the supply chain, the focus is on reorganizing the supply chain in the high-tech field.
If the U.S. and China compete to build their own global supply chain, it will lead to significant changes in the industrial environment of neighboring countries. The Korean government is expected to need a strategic response based on the national interest by closely analyzing the impact of supply chain competition between the U.S. and China on our industrial environment.",유현정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108042089
한국 2022: 윤석열 정부의 출범과 민주주의 후퇴,"This study analyzes major political issues, focusing on the democratic backsliding, and the notable changes in socio-economic conditions and relations with Korea’s neighboring countries in 2022. It shows that Korean citizens could gradually return to their normal daily lives last year despite the rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. Although the surge in housing prices stopped and employment rates increased, the burden of repayment of loan interest, due to high interest rates, increased for citizens. In response to North Korea’s repeated missile tests, joint military drills and financial sanctions of South Korea, the U.S., and Japan and President Yoon’s “Audatious Initiative” for denuclearization failed to change North Korea’s hostile attitudes. Political polarization intensified during the 20th presidential election and the 8th local elections, and various signs of democratic backsliding, such as the over-reliance on the presidential decree, political partiality of the prosecutors office and the police department, personalization of party politics, and the encroachment of freedom of the press and (academic) expression, have emerged. Although Korea has strong democratic resilience, such emerging concerns of democratic backsliding show that it is necessary to drive political reforms for the establishment of the ‘checks and balances’ between the branches of the government.",지병근,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108532996
시진핑 시대 민족국가 통합과 소수민족의 서발턴화,"This paper analyzes the characteristics of the Chinese Communist Party's national view and historical perspective centered on the “Chinese nation(中華民族),” along with the features of national common language character policies aimed at fostering national identity. In addition, the situation and issues of national education policies changed in accordance with this state-led integration policy were examined focusing on Xinjiang, Yanbian, and Hong Kong. Since the expression “The great revival of the Chinese nation” was included in the Communist Party and National Constitution, it has been reorganized into the goal that the Chinese Communist Party has always dreamed of for the past 100 years and has become an ideology that the entire country should pursue. In order to realize this dream of national revival, the creation of a “Chinese national community consciousness,” succession to the “Chinese children(中華兒女)” generation, and education on the “correct view of history of the Chinese nation” are being emphasized. As the concept of the Chinese nation gains prominence for national unity, minority groups that have maintained their cultural identity through ethnic language education are gradually marginalized. In other words, within the process of the “political subjectivization” of the Chinese nation, which is planned and executed by the ruling power, the opportunity to voice their perspectives is gradually diminishing, resulting in suppression and subordination.",장윤미,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108737636

Currently, the mutual animosity of the Korean and Chinese youth is the result of the chemical combination of perceptions and emotions between nationalism and individualism and between fandom and hate which is at first glance independent and unencountered. The mechanism of resonance of these different factors has differences in the situation and context of each country, but there is no significant difference between Korea and China in the basic structure and method. This study focused on the emotions of Chinese youth formed within the mechanism without defining extreme nationalism as the basic temperament of Chinese youth. In doing so, it was concluded that the alternative in question should not be limited to the alleviation of nationalist conflict, but should be expanded to a more fundamental area of youth life.",정주영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108262783
여성 없는 민주주의와 ‘K-페미니즘’ 문학의 경계 넘기 - 일본에서의 『82년생 김지영』 번역수용 현상을 중심으로 -,"This study examines the dynamics surrounding women's voices in the realm of politics and social movements in contemporary Japan, and against this backdrop, the context and aspects of the recent “K-feminism” literary boom in Japan from a perspective of cultural translation. More specifically, by examining each context of and the correlations among democracy without women, the relative weakness of feminism as a social movement, and the reception of “K-feminism,” the study explores how the women’s voices in the realm of politics, social movements, and culture are being transmitted and connected.
In Japanese democracy, which is characterized by the absence of women, there is a structure in which women's voices are not adequately reflected in setting the social agenda. On the other hand, compared with the women’s movement and feminism developed in various forms in the 1970s and 1980s Japan, Japanese feminism in the 1990s lost its popular base as the advent of the post-feminist situation and gender backlash interlocked. Moreover, as feminism was incorporated into the realm of academia, it failed to address the everyday feminist agenda. Under this circumstance, it can be said that it was “K-literature” led by the novel, Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982 by Cho Nam-Joo that transgressed the boundaries of language and penetrated this void through translation. Thus, the reception of “K-feminist” literature in Japan is a response to the vacuum created in the development of Japanese feminism, namely, the absence of everyday language to talk about feminist issues. It remains to be seen what direction Japanese society and democracy will take while appropriating the linguistic resources of “K-feminist” literature.",김지영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108248275
이라크 전쟁과 이·팔 평화과정의 장래,"This study attempts to explore the direction of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and peace process, relating the war in Iraq of 2003 to the peace process. Does the war result influence the conflict and peace process? What effect on the conflict and peace process, and in what direction are the trends running?
This paper reviews briefly the backgrounds, assumptions, contents and implementations of the Oslo accords since 1993, and examines the positions of Middle East Quartet including the Bush administration of the United States, Israel, and the Palestinians. And then, four possible scenarios of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians are discussed relating the Iraqi war in 2003 with the Israeli - Palestinian conflict and peace process. The first scenario, which is an optimistic prospect though its probability is low, envisages a comprehensive agreement resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through peaceful negotiations. The second scenario assumes an exacerbation of the current bloody confrontation that would lead to an all-out regional war. And the third scenario predicts a cease fire between the two parties while the fourth scenario assumes a continuation of the current violent and painful situation for both parties. The fourth scenario is the most likely outcome under the Sharon government but in a longer term the author is more optimistic.
The short-term prospect for a settlement and peace including the issue of Jerusalem is uncertain but in a longer term I am optimistic because there is no military solution. And both Israelis and Palestinians still support for efforts to bring peace and reconciliation between the two parties.
It is, therefore, reasonable to believe that someday, when the two sides are more ready for agreement, they will return to those principles, provided at the Camp David summit and they will once again serve as the base for any future agreement.",최영철,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40026377
영화의 자발적 동원:이탈리아 네오리얼리즘 영화에 나타난 파시즘 ‘덮어두기’에 관한 연구,"This paper analyses the evaluation and recognition of fascism from the cinematographic world of the Neorealism after the end of the World War II. Postwar Italian politics and socio-cultural society had to face the question of how to view and evaluate the fascist regime that has dominated Italy for the past 20 years. First of all, the evaluation and recognition of fascism was closely related to the international status and fate of Italy in the future. Domestically, the evaluation and perception of fascism was also closely related to the identity issue of the new Italian government. On May 14, 1949, the government of De Gasperi ended the ongoing trial of punishment for prisoners and halted the execution of prisoners already imprisoned. The failure of liquidation of fascist collaborators was the result of the evaluation and recognition debate on fascism that had been raised steadily since the liberation of Rome in June 1944.
This debate was led by the socio-cultural community at the time, and the film industry actively participated in. In particular, the Italian film industry, which presented a new type of film movement called Neorealism, used to suggest the construction of a new Italy by burying the memories and experiences of fascism through films. This 'burying fascism' was expressed through various types of metaphors placed throughout the films. Based on the above-mentioned background, this study examines the correlation between the Italian situation and fascism-awareness debate immediately after World War II. Later, we will examine the political meaning of neo-realism films in terms of politicizing the film. Next, we will consider how these films participated in burying the fascism, focusing on the metaphors expressed in neo-realism films produced immediately after the war.",이선필,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106957029

In this study, we utilized an open-source web-based application called Voyant-Tools to examine the vocabulary frequency and range of each text, and based on this, we made inferences about the characters and their characteristics in each text. The two texts selected for analysis were Robinson Crusoe and Foe, with the latter being re-read and re-written from a postcolonial perspective, which is noteworthy. By extracting the most frequent vocabulary for each text and analyzing their distribution, we were able to deduce the characters for each text. Additionally, by examining the passages and paragraphs in which the derived vocabulary appeared, it was possible to understand the context in which the vocabulary was used, even without reading the texts closely. Africa is comprised of 55 countries, and as such, its literary output is vast. Therefore, it has been practically impossible to read and comprehend all African literature up to this point. Through distant reading utilizing text mining, it becomes possible to gain a better understanding of African literature that has been inaccessible for various reasons. In particular, this study employed text mining to compare and analyze European classics and their re-writings, enabling an objective comprehension of the differences between each text. However, when it comes to understanding African literature, which cannot be discussed without considering post-colonialism, distant reading alone has its limitations. For the time being, a combination of distant reading and close reading is necessary.",윤서영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108658085
탄소중립 실현을 위한 탄소배출권과 블루카본의 최근 연구동향분석: 네트워크 인터페이스 및 토픽모델링 분석을 중심으로,"The whole world has been making efforts to respond to climate change internationally since the 2015 Paris Agreement through carbon neutrality. Korea has also announced its ‘2050 Carbon Neutral Strategy’for transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Blue carbon-related technologies have emerged as pending issues in the ocean, it is time to make a systematic plan for scientific, technological, and policy management support. This study examined the flow of blue carbon and blue carbon credit research around the world over the past 20 years, focusing on academic research papers, and tried to derive social and policy implications of carbon trading from network analysis of research trends. As for the research method, network mapping analysis using VOSviewer and LDA topic analysis were performed on papers included in KCI and papers included in SPRINGER with Net-Miner's Biblio Data Collector. As a result, carbon credit research was actively conducted around 2016, and interest in carbon emission and reduction increased according to the Paris Agreement in 2019, and in 2022, plant materials, especially halophytes, mangroves, etc. A trend was found in the progress of the research. In addition, carbon credits show a wide range of connectivity to research on issues related to existing carbon, but the connectivity related to blue carbon is still low. Through the LDA topic analysis, it was found that research related to carbon credits has increased globally since 2010, but studies related to blue carbon have been actively conducted in the 2020s.
According to the conclusion of this study, existing studies on carbon credits account for a large proportion, whereas studies on blue carbon and blue carbon credits are still insufficient as they are in their infancy. Therefore, blue carbon research in the future will shed light on the value of tidal flats and salt marshes through complex integrated research between disciplines, and through efficient use and preservation, blue carbon will need international agreement and certification as a new carbon sink. In future studies, additional research on qualitative analysis of blue carbon reduction using carbon credits, existing plant materials, and halophytes is needed.",김두원,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108396202
도시 및 농·어촌지역 미충족 의료서비스 경험 영향요인 : 2019년과 2020년 비교,"COVID-19 has changed our lives overall and has brought particularly many changes in the area of medicine. There have been many changes in the provision of medicine and modes of using medical services, too. In research to identify and reduce the inequality and imbalance of medical systems and services between regions, it is necessary to consider how things have been changed due to COVID-19. Therefore, this study is aimed to identify the current status of urban and rural unmet healthcare before and after COVID-19, provide data to check related factors, and present basic data to make policies in consideration of the causes of unmet healthcare.
This study utilized data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey conducted in 2019 and 2020 before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Cross-tabulation analysis and dichotomous logistic regression analysis were done on 426 and 368 respondents in 2019 and 2020 respectively, who said they had experienced unmet healthcare. According to the findings, both urban and rural local insurance subscribers indicated increase in the experience of unmet healthcare, and the increase rate was greater in rural local insurance subscribers, and the experience of unmet healthcare decreased in the group with low income. Also, regarding patients with chronic diseases, the experience of unmet healthcare decreased more in rural areas than in urban areas. However, the analysis showed that the group that said they had depression had twice more experience of unmet healthcare after COVID-19 than before.
This implies that it is needed to consider such situations as the reduced income of self-employed people and the deepening depression of people resulted from social sanctions, for instance, restrictions on business hours or refraining from private gatherings.
Also, aside from regional differences between urban and rural areas, expanding medical support with emergent medical aid or non-face-to-face treatment did reduce the factors of unmet healthcare in the low-income group during the pandemic situation. In addition, political efforts involving medical reservation services, tele-medicine care, or the roles of health centers and health clinics strengthened seem to have influenced the modes of using medical services. The limitation of this study is that the survey was done simply by asking questions about whether they had visited hospital or not without considering various situations like social foundations or policies. However, it is meaningful in that it examined the differences in the experience of unmet healthcare between urban and rural areas before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study attempted to identify politically whether unmet healthcare is caused not by individual differences but by regional, particularly, urban-rural differences. This author also suggests that follow-up research will have to be done to complement the environment and conditions for medical use as well as quantitative and qualitative differences in the medical infrastructure.",김귀현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108396208
2018년 이스라엘/팔레스타인 분쟁 전망,"This paper intends to establish the main causes and drivers of the recent Israeli-Palestinian conflicts and forecast for the future. These conflicts are the problems not only between Israel and Palestine, but of the International community involving world powers and the United Nations. Seemingly, these are religious or political problems, as shown by Donald Trump’s announcement in December 2017 that the US recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. However, these are in fact economic problems: the core cause of the conflicts is the natural gas fields in Gaza and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. This paper analyzes policies of some regional states, the United States, and the United Nations concerning Israel and Palestine as well as Israel’s policies for energy hegemony in the East Mediterranean gas fields.",홍미정,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105272034
"EU의 유럽근린정책이 동방 파트너십 국가의 거버넌스 증진에 미치는 영향: 우크라이나, 조지아, 몰도바 사례를 중심으로","The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy(ENP) on the governance promotion of Eastern Partnership(EaP) countries from the perspective of international cooperation. In particular, this study selected three countries, Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova, as the ‘most likely case’ to promote governance through the European Neighbourhood Policy among Eastern Partnership countries.
As a result of case analysis through ‘causal process tracing’, it was confirmed that the dynamics of promoting governance in Eastern Partnership countries through European Neighbourhood Policy depended on the unique ‘causal mechanism’ and ‘contextual conditions’ of each case. Above all, the effect of promoting ‘democratic governance’ through EU’s ‘values-based Europeanization’ was rejected without being empirically proven. On the other hand, the hypothesis that the EU’s ‘interests-based Europeanization’ would promote the ‘effective governance’ of Eastern Partnership countries was supported in all cases. In particular, it was found that the promotion of ‘effective governance’ through ‘interests-based Europeanization’ produced unintended consequences that contributed to the regime stability rather than the regime reform of Eastern Partnership countries.",김훈,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108035427
북유럽 지방소멸 위기와 정책적 대응: 스웨덴 사례를 중심으로,"At the global level, while the phenomenon of low birth rate and aging is evident in developed countries, including Korea, among Nordic countries, the concentration of population in cities is intensifying. In contrast, the trend of population growth continues in Sweden. This article is meant to derive specific implications for Korea's local extinction crisis and policy response by looking over the regional policy characteristics of Sweden. As a result of this study, the influx of immigration, universal welfare, and work-life balance policy affected Sweden's continuous population growth in terms of population policy. The problem of regional imbalance between densely populated areas and declining areas can be addressed at the level of regional policy by multi-level governance between transnational organizations (EU)-public (central-local government)-private (third sector). Decentralization and transfer of responsibility from the public to the private sector have been conducted by responding through third-sector cooperation and stakeholder dialogue mechanisms. As a result, the possibility of regional development and population mobility between regions are presented. To respond to Korea’s low birth rate, aging population, and local extinction of Korea, it is necessary to break away from the current fertility-enhancing population and passive labor market policy. Convergence governance in policy establishment and implementation, cooperative structure among multi-level stakeholders, and active regional policy through participation in designing and implementing long-term and comprehensive procedures of the grassroots 3rd sector will be needed.",장선화,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108601345
『천변풍경』에 나타난 사회상과 작가의식,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the social characteristic and the consciousness of author by taking notice of city life in 1930's described in Park, Tae-Won's Chunbyun Pungkyung. In the work, the anomie of social structure arisen from Japaness colonial policy was demonstrated, which is found culturally in the destruction of moral value and economically in the reification of sex.
To grasp the consciousness of author toward the social situation, first of all I have examined implied author's psychic distance by classifing the character type and attempted the conscioussness of author toward the social regime by investigating the conflicting structure. On the basis of the consciousness of community and the norminative means, the character type was classified into conformist-type, ritualist-type, destructor-type, and innovator-type.
Being related with the character type, the psychic distance is near in case of conformist-type and innovator-type, but is far in that of ritualist-type and destructor-type. The conflicting structure in this work is divided into two parts. One is a confrontation between the observance the haves and have-nots.
In this work the former has been central while the latter has appeared faintly and symbolically, which is a reflection of the author's recognition toward the social system. The fact that complicated structure with conformity and moral value is strong while the economical conflict-structure with the conservativeness is weak is the reason why the author intends to find a solution to the social anomie is a permitted meaningful function.
Therefore, Chunbyun Pungkyung is composed of the unique structure, namely, a mosaic structure of a short-story, and attempts an experimental technique that moves a point of view variously. But judging from the situation of the times, this novel is a conformable to the regime and belongs to passive category from the viewpoint of describing the distorted cultural phenomena and the restoration of moral.",韓昌燁,1990,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2006752
