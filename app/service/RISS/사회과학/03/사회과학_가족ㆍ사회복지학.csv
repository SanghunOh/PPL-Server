Fourth, a national research center(institute on aging) conducting studies on the variety of issues on aging should be established and the results founded by the center should be used four the social policies for older Koreans.
Fifth, elder rights protection acts should be initiated and included in the Older Koreans Act. To protect the elderly living in the community as well as in institutional. settings against elder abuse(physical and emotional), neglect, and material exploitation, elder abuse protection act should be initiated. Also the Ombudsman program which advocates for the residents of nursing homes, board and care homes, assisted living facilities and similar adult care facilities, should be initiated.
Sixth, the Korean government's social policy for the elderly, known as `family support first, pubic support next policy', should be changed.

청소년의 도박접근성과 도박문제 수준과의 관계에서 비합리적 도박신념의 조절효과,"The purpose of this study was to examine the moderating effect of gambling-related irrational belief on the relationship between gambling accessibility and gambling problems among adolescents. In order to achieve this purpose, the present study used secondary data obtained from the Korea Center on Gambling Problems, and study sample consisted of 1,530 adolescents (ages 13 to 18). Results of moderated regression models demonstrate that a higher level of gambling accessibility and a higher level of gambling-related irrational belief tended to increase gambling problems. Also, an interaction effect of gambling accessibility and gambling-related irrational belief was significant, which implied that gambling-related irrational belief moderated the relationship between gambling accessibility and gambling problems among adolescents. Study results imply that gambling problems are affected by a complex interaction of environmental factors at a macro-level and individual factors at a micro-level. Therefore, it is necessary to make an effort to decrease gambling accessibility at a macro-level and modify gambling-related irrational beliefs at a micro-level in prevention and treatment of gambling problems among adolescents.",이슬행,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106867413
