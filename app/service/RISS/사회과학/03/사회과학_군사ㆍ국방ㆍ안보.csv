It comes as no surprise that different perspectives on this war exist.
This study analyzed a year of the Russia-Ukraine War from the perspective of offensive realism. This war is of particular interest, because it heralds a new way of war that differs from the Post-Cold War conflicts appeared after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and is also different in every way from the War on Terror, the epitome of contemporary military operations. Carrying out this analysis of these changes is essential to the discussion of security issues and a future war on the Korean Peninsula.
Subsequent analysis therefore focused on defining the paradigm shift in the way wars are fought, considered from the perspective of military strategy, the operation of military power, and the construction of military power. The current frontline stalemate can be explained as due to the failure of Russia’s military strategy and the use of military force and, by contrast, Ukraine’s the creative use of its military power.
The implications of this war for the security and future war on the Korean peninsula are as follows: South Korea must be prepared for Chinese invasion of North Korea. The direction of preparedness is, first, to actively pursue policies of strengthening military cooperation with neighboring countries on the Korean peninsula such as India, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Australia. Second, to have an asymmetric response capability to repel Chinese invasion. Third, to conduct cognitive warfare to open up North Korean society. Fourth, to develop a ROK-US combined defense system led by the ROK military. Fifth, to formulate a policy to strengthen citizen’s spiritual combat power by reviewing the necessity of institutionalized education of patriotism.
Fundamentally, future wars are likely to occur in the gray-zone between war and peace. It is difficult to distinguish from enemy to friend. The line between military and non-military threats blurs. And each nation, focusing its own will and military capabilities may come into conflict with one another in invisible domain in a complex way. In other words, combined manned and unmanned warfare can occur the crowd. We must be prepared for this mode of warfare.",허광환,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108648950
6.25전쟁의 발발원인에 관한 연구,"Since the Korean War, multi-laterally analyzed by Traditionalism, Recisionism, Post-Traditionalism, and Post-Revisionism, was an international war with a notion of civil war, researches have taken a similar approach as the studies on the Cold War. As John G. Stoessinger puts it, wars, which may determine the rise and fall of a nation, represent the extremely interdependent situation. For that reason, making a rational judgment requires a foundation of so-called principles and rationality, more than just fragmentary knowledge or orders of a leader. Based on the idea that wars are the outcomes of strategic judgments of leaders who represent the nations, this article analyzes the decision making processes of Kim, Il-Seong and Stalin via game theory along with the survey on the previous literature. After the analysis, we found that Kim's strategy in preparation of the Korean War served as a foundation to make Stalin to choose the strategies that Kim wants, and Stalin as well responded in an anticipation of Kim's strategies in order to maximize the benefits upon the victory of the war.",김도영,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106923095
여군 인력의 효율적 활용을 위한 시론,"The gist of this paper is that change in the awareness of female soldiers should be made before applying the way of utilizing female soldiers argued by researchers. To this end, the same physical fitness testing standard should be applied to both male and female soldiers and awareness on the management of female soldiers, which is different from that of male soldiers should be changed as a natural welfare dimension. The change in the awareness enables us to differentiate the matters that should be applied equally to both male and female soldiers and matters that should be applied differently to female soldiers considering bodily difference and physical capability differently. The application of the same standard as male soldiers at the starting point to be a solider is a mandatory course for female soldiers to be not a ‘female’ solider but an independent soldier. However, naturally, there is bodily difference between men and women. Therefore, the difference should be respected systematically by the society at a welfare level. However, the respect for natural difference should not be translated into a way of marginalizing women.",정계룡(Ge-Ryong Jung),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105435797
AI 공격용 드론 개발 방향 및 시사점,"The role of attack drones in the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia is drawing worldwide attention.
In order to prepare for changes in the defense security environment and rapid decline in military resources, the Ministry of National Defense announced the National Defense Innovation 4.0 Basic Plan in March 2023, and established the concept of joint operation by reflecting the operation of AI-based manned and unmanned complex systems and new concept weapon systems. did Drones are the most important force in building manned and unmanned complex systems, and the dronebot combat system will be the basis for promoting Defense Innovation 4.0. Drones are a system that can be operated for multiple purposes that change their use according to mission equipment, and it is key to have advanced technology that is suitable for the future battlefield environment and efficient.
If the existing attack drone is an operating system in which combatants remotely control the ground control device while watching the ground control device, the future direction of the development of attack drones for the Korean military to apply to dronebots is an AI attack drone in which the drone detects the target by itself and directly strikes and self-destructs. will develop into In order to develop AI attack drones, not only the performance of the drone system, but also AI-based cutting-edge technology for object tracking technology, object identification technology and shape recognition technology of reconnaissance equipment (EO/IR), which is mission equipment, as well as attack ammunition or Small, high-performance warhead design technology, ultra-small fuze design technology, shock absorption and launch control device technology, etc. must be developed to mount the projectile.
In addition, as the amount of image information acquired through mission equipment increases, high-speed data transmission technology development to improve the transmission rate between the aircraft and the ground control equipment in real time must be simultaneously developed. It is necessary to quickly overcome drone and AI technologies, which are currently very poor compared to advanced countries, and take the lead in developing intelligent AI attack drones with excellent autonomy based on Korea's excellent ICT technology.
Therefore, this study aims to find out the technological trends of domestic and foreign attack drones and to consider the development plans and tasks of AI attack drones.",유재명,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108569453
국방환경 변화에 대응하는 육군 ROTC 제도 개선 방향 탐색 연구 : 관련 법령을 중심으로,"The ROKA ROTC system has been a major acquisition method for entry-level officers for the past 60 years, but recently, the application rate for military officer candidates has plummeted and the number of dropouts has continued, making it difficult to acquire excellent primary grade officers. Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to provide policy improvements to acquire excellent primary grade officer resources by using Easton's system theory. For this, this paper searched changing environments both inside and outside our military, analyzed related laws and main issues for operating ROTC system, and then suggested policy improvements focusing on the analysis and amendment needs of ROTC system.
First, as factors for defense environmental change, the population decline, the change in people's perception of the military, the characteristics of the MZ generation, and continuous improvement of service conditions for enlisted soldiers were analyzed.
Second, this study asserted that laws related ROTC establishment and course operation, ROTC cadets status and treatment, short-term service officer service period, and employment support for discharged ROTC cadets needs to be amended.
Last, The following related policy improvement directions are required. It is necessary to amend related laws so that the results of the evaluation of universities by the Ministry of National Defense can affect the actual operation of the universities. In addition, it is necessary to improve the treatment of ROTC cadets, such as treating them as quasi-military and providing monetary support. Also, it is required to gradually shorten the service period for ROTC officers and to actively strengthen post-discharge employment support for officers who were discharged from military after a short or middle service.",김세용,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108490178

강대국들의 하이브리드전(Hybrid Warfare)과 주요 사례분석,"This paper establishes the concept of hybrid warfare and the stage of war and analyzes the cases carried out by powerful countries. In the early 21st century, hybrid warfare evolved to reflect the changes in the environment of globalization and informatization, and the war took on the character of a limited war suitable for more political purposes, and is carried out at the national strategic level. According to the analysis of the U.S. annexation of Hawaii, Japan's annexation of the Korean Peninsula, Russia's annexation of Crimea, and China's internalization of the Spratly Islands, Hybrid warfare has been proven to be a way of conducting war that has existed since the past and has proven its effectiveness in modern times. It was confirmed that the procedure of hybrid warfare by the major powers was carried out in the form of 'targeting political core weaknesses → proxy operation → regime weakening (regime change) → termination'. The implications of this shift to hybrid warfare are that no superpower can wage a military-oriented war and In wa timer, the country should be considered interstate war and intrastate war at the same time. In addition, the South Korean military needs to re-establish clear national security goals in preparation for hybrid warfare, break away from proxy war and the danger of buffer zones, and thoroughly prepare for North Korea's hybrid warfare.",김남철,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108177175

인천상륙작전과 북한군의 대응,"The Inchon Landing Operation commanded by General MacArthur in the Korean War has drawn attentions from many scholars as a milestone that had changed the course of war. It has been pointed out that its success was attributed to MacArthur's achievement of the impeccable surprise attack by deceiving the enemy and concealing the operational plan.
Whether North Korea had foreseen the Incheon Landing Operation has yet been confirmed until concerned documents of North Korea were examined.
Myeng Rim Park was the first to discover among archives seized by the United Nations (UN) operational documents of North Korean Forces stationed in Incheon area and to investigate them. Based on new information obtained from his research, he asserts ""the Incheon Landing Operation was never a surprise attack"", for North Korean Forces had known in advance that Incheon would be the landing location and taken measures to prepare for the possible attack. Precisely for these reasons, he explains, it took 13 days for the UN Forces to capture Seoul even after they had landed at Incheon.
This paper intends to study how accurate the North Korean prediction had been on the Incheon Landing Operation before its execution and in what ways North Korea planned to respond to this new development after the UN landing by comprehensively investigating North Korean and Soviet records around the time of the Incheon Landing Operation.
Close reconstruction of North Korean response around the Incheon Landing results in the following conclusions: First, before the Incheon Landing Operation North Korea had taken measures to reinforce the coastal defense against the possibility of the UN Forces landing at the rear of the occupied In conclusion, with immaturity of strategic operational leadership, Il Sing Kim and North Korean military leaders could not prevent the main body of the North Korean Forces from being entrapped into the encircling net created by UN Forces landing at Incheon. Some Chinese and Soviet leaders had advised to withdraw the main body and to reinforce the rear after the North Korean failure of the August and September offensives, but Il Sung Kim and North Korean People's Army leaders refused to abandon the optimism of ""Occupation of All Korean Peninsula by Ultimate Offensive."" Even after the Incheon Landing Operation had been carried out, they did not make a prompt response to the threat at the rear, thus resulting in the destruction of the military main body.",김광수,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101591892
냉전 초기 소련의 핵개발 특성과 핵전략,"In order to effectively respond to North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, it is necessary to identify the Soviet's initial nuclear strategy, which had an absolute influence on North Korea's nuclear development. North Korea was founded based on the Soviet socialist system, and the military command system was affected by the Soviet Union.
The Soviet's early nuclear strategy had been developed in a competitive landscape with the United States. In the Stalin era, the nuclear power gap with the US was too large and the absence of a strategic bomber capable of carrying nuclear warheads had made the Soviet nuclear weapons useful only as a deterrent to the United States. But later in the Khrushchyov era, efforts were made to balance US nuclear power by focusing on the development of hydrogen bombs and long-range ballistic missiles.
As with the Soviet Union, North Korea is likely to continue to develop its nuclear weapons strategy, such as reforming its command system and declaring its nuclear doctrine. Just as the Soviet Union had focused on developing long-range missiles instead of strategic bombers to counter the US, North Korea is also expected to make efforts to diversify the means of transport, including SLBM. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a suitable countermeasure strategy.",김길준,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104296864
중·일간 센카쿠열도 영유권 분쟁 연구,"Since the Senkaku(Diaoyudao) Islands are uninhabited islands located in the East China Sea and have geo-strategic importance as abundant natural resources and SLOCs, both China and Japan have endeavored to gain sovereignty in the disputable territory through historical title,administrative action,international solidarity and military power.
China insists that as China's indigenous territory attached to Taiwan since the Ming(明) Dynasty, the Islands are Chinese fishery, and many historical records about the sovereignty are still well-preserved. China also insists that Japan robbed it of the islands through the illegal treaties like Shimonoseki, San francisco,etc.On the otherhand,Japan insists that it first discovered the islands in1884 year, and through the continuous exploration since 1885 year, it at last confirmed the islands as uninhabited islands.Japan insists that the Senkaku Islands are not attached to Taiwan, but are its' indigenous territory.
In the early-1970s to the mid-1990s, the dispute didn't escalate because of mutual strategic needs. But, in the late-1990s to the late-2000s, because of threat from China, USA's active engagement policy and Japan's return to anormal country, Sino-Chinese dispute hasbeen increasingly escalated, but the chance of cooperation still exists.

중국의 6ㆍ25전쟁 개입과 영향 연구 - 중국의 진보적 시각을 중심으로 -,"Sixty two years have passed since the outbreak of Korean War. The security and regionalorder in NortheastAsia have been very precarious because of the competitions on hegemony, maritime conflicts, and issues about North Korea. The Korean War was a kind of Hot War waged by some global powers that had ideological, confrontational relationships among themselves during the Cold War. The military showdown had brought about millions of casualties, separation of families, and the division of Korea that continues eventoday. The People's Republic of China(PRC), a newborn regime at the time, had intervened in the war to suffer huge damage in human and material resources, and had paid a high price in its domestic affairs, economy, politics, and diplomacy. However, the PRC did not shrink away from its fight with the Western troops led by the United States. Samuel Huntington said, ""The Korean War is an example that symbolically shows full-scale clashes between the Chinese and the Western civilization.""Due to the insufficiency of data available, it was not easy to find out ""Why, How, and For what ""China had intervened in the Korean War.

It is the transformation into a technical group in our efforts that is the key to success. However, it not only means properly establishing the technology and weapon system, but also means securing enough skilled and professional manpower to carry out this task. That the acquisition rate of officers is rapidly declining is a very serious problem together with the recent shortage in military personnel. Major countries, such as the U.S. and the U.K., guarantee the employment of discharged soldiers through private military companies as one of the measures to improve these problems, thereby they can achieve optimum results in both increasing combat power and helping discharged soldiers successfully translate their transferable and specialized skills into the civilian workforce to ensure their professionalism and reliability. The Korean military needs to make efforts to improve the employment environment for discharged soldiers through the use of private military companies as shown in the cases of foreign military forces.

러시아의 회색지대 갈등 전략과 우크라이나 전쟁 결정,"From the perspective of the ‘Grey zone conflict strategy’, this paper examines the war on Ukraine triggered by February 24, 2022 that has unfolded since 2014 and the crisis created since December 2021 after the Russian military mobilized at the Russian-Ukrainian border, and presents decisive factors that influenced Russia's decision to invade Ukraine.
The gray zone conflict strategy was quite effective when Russia took control of Crimea in March 2014 and Civil war broke out in Ukraine's Donbas region, but as time went by, Russia attempts to use the gray zone conflict strategy in central Ukraine, including Kyiv. In addition, the war on Ukraine created around the border with Ukraine since December 2021 has deviated from the basic framework of the gray zone conflict strategy to gradually benefit from the war without crossing the threshold of war.
Russia eventually decided to use gray zone conflict strategy in the pursuit of negotiations, 1) withdrawal of troops, 2) armed attacks, and 3) negotiations, which were possible just before the war in Ukraine. The policy-making process similar to the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan seems to have been reenacted during the invasion of Ukraine. The similarities include unrealistic political goals, discussions and decisions by a small coterie, low awareness of the international environment, optimistic success scenarios, and disregard for international political and economic costs.
In sum, Russia succeeded in achieving the tactical goals of the Grey zone conflict strategy, but turned to war by failing to achieve the strategic goal of preventing Ukraine from being incorporated into the West. Russia decided to intervene by force, judging that the gains from the war were greater than the losses that would be lost, but this would cause unexpected damage.",우평균,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108173765

조선후기 전술변화와 중앙 군영의 편제 추이,"This article focuses on the military organization of the central military camp and its transformation during the later period of the Joseon Dynasty. To prove the details regarding the military organization, some of them, such as Eoyeongcheong (御營廳) and Geumwiyeong (禁衛營) were discussed chronologically, with a focus on the first military camp which became the standard of military organization at the time―Hunryeondogam (訓鍊都監). In the early state of the Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592, or Imjin War, Joseon was defeated by the Japanese military armed with matchlock muskets. In early 1593, Joseon paid attention to Ming’s forces’ new tactics that they employed to recapture the Pyongyang Fortress. After Joseon’s officers observed the Ming’s effectiveness at defeating the Japanese forces, the Joseon military changed its military organization and training according to Ming’s way of fighting. From the early 17th century, northern Jurchen posed a major threat. To deter attack of the Jurchen cavalry, the Joseon military attempted to train their own cavalry, and designed new tactics that integrated the cavalry, infantry, and artillery. In this process, some special organizations were established: Chongyungchong (摠戎廳) for capital area defense, and Eoyeongcheong (御營廳) for strengthening the king’s guard. Joseon’s new military camps, which were reinforced with sword-and-spear soldiers, archers, and artillery gunners in the center and to which cavalries were added, demonstrated its organizational effectiveness in several battles during the Manchu War of 1636. Through many combats in this war, the notion of effectiveness of matchlock muskets comparing to bows and arrows pervaded Joseon. Inevitably, the search for tactics that centered around artillery gunners led to the organization that centered around artillery gunners.
Joseon encountered new circumstances in the late 17th century: threat of Manchu has decreased and the plan to conquer the North was interrupted. Accordingly, the Joseon reduced military strength, which caused establishment of Geumwiyeong (禁衛營). It was Kim Seok-ju, the Ministry of War who suggested to integrate Hunlyeonbyeoldae (訓鍊別隊) and Jeongchogun (精抄軍) camps into Geumwiyeong (禁衛營) in 1682. With an advent of Geumwiyeong (禁衛營), the practice of five military units system was established. The development of many military camps that occurred during the 17th century indicates that the Joseon Dynasty indeed actively met the military needs of the rapidly altering international politics in East Asia. In conclusion, the development military camps in this period has a significant meaning not as a simple change of political or military system, but as a practical example of Joseon’s response to the dynamic international politics in East Asia from the end of the 16th century to the middle of the 18th century.",노영구,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104296858

주일미군과 유엔사 후방기지의 전략적 가치 고찰,"This study seeks to explore the value of the U.S. forces in Japan and UNC rear bases in Japan, which are important, but not well known to the public. For this, it was necessary to understand USFJ and UNC rear bases in a macroscopic perspective by analyzing their role, and the role of Japan in the case of the Korean War, what capabilities and status the current USFJ and UNC rear bases in Japan have, and how they are related to Japan.
Through the Korean War, the United States became aware of the importance of Korea; hence it intervened quickly through the United Nations Security Council and created the UNC, and in a short period of time of less than a week, the US Army of the Far East appeared on the Korean Peninsula. On the other hand, Japan made a major contribution to the victory of the war by producing war supplies, providing bases, and clearing sea mines throughout the war.
In this context of the Korean war, the UNC rear bases were created by a treaty between the US and Japanese government in order for the UNC to carry out the war. In September 1951, through the ‘Yoshida-Acheson Exchange Memorandum’, the Japanese government provided facilities and services to the UN forces operating in Korea. In February 1954, by “UN Forces Status Agreement” between UNC member states and the Japanese government, 11 countries including the USA gained free access to the 7 UNC rear bases without prior approval from the Japanese government. However, as these UNC rear bases were selected among the USFJ bases in Japan, it was accorded the UNC rear bases would withdraw within 90 days if UNC was disbanded.
When we look at the UNC, we tend to have a limited view considering it simply as an armistice agreement. The UNC is linked to various elements of war, such as the USFJ, the Japanese government, the Japan Self-Defense Forces, and the UNC member states through the UNC rear base. War is an essential matter that determines the fate of the country, and it is desirable as it will serve as an opportunity to reflect on how to incorporate these important elements into the national security strategy.",박종근,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108119599
러시아-우크라이나 전쟁 분석: 러시아의 해군력 운용과 함의,"This paper analyzes the factors behind the usefulness and limitations of Russian naval power usage in the Russo-Ukraine war and explores the policy implications for the Korean Navy. In July 2022, Russia presented a strong image of itself in the new maritime doctrine, emphasizing its strong naval power. Additionally, the Atlantic Ocean, including the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, was declared a vital region for the country. However, despite its formidable naval power, the Russian Navy has been unable to make a significant contribution to the ongoing war in the region. This can be attributed to the traditional and outdated operational methods of the Russian Navy and Ukraine's anti-access area denial strategy. Despite a year of imposing a strong naval blockade, the risks were overlooked, and the importance of rising collective maritime powers, continuous military projection across different theaters, and effective integration of forces were neglected. Furthermore, deficiencies in operational planning due to ship construction, education and training, and lack of information were also brought to attention. Ukraine's anti-access area denial strategy, consisting of mines, coastal defense cruise missiles, high-speed patrol ships, and drones, explains why the Russian Navy is limited to maintaining its fleet in the region. The usage of Russian naval power in this war provides valuable insights for Korea, as the current battlefield resembles the East Asian Ocean, which is a stage for the hegemonic competition between the United States and China. This war highlights the need for Korea to establish a strategy for protecting sea lanes of communication, develop effective asymmetric strategies, establish the concept of swarm warfare, strengthen mine warfare capabilities, and focus on shipbuilding and education and training.",최영찬,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635987
낙동강선 방어 작전시 맥아더와 워커장군의 작전지도 고찰,"Operational conduct consists of decisions and actions of command and control which links the strategic and tactical levels of war. Operational level commanders translate strategic guidance into military operations and create conditions of tactical actions.
To better understand the process of changing strategic guidance into military operations, I studied General McArthur & General Walker in the Korean war (6·25war) and how they were able to understand national strategic objectives, solve problems regarding insufficient resources as well as plan and execute the Nakdong river line defense operation and Incheon amphibious operation.
In regard to create conditions of tactical actions, I studied General McArthur's & General Walker's ability to coordinate several battles consecutively as well as simultaneously, to create the most advantageous conditions for success.
General Mc Arthur created favorable conditions for General Walker without a squad leader mentality which enabled General Walker to employ his forces as he deemed appropriate. As a result, General Walker was able to create leverage while successfully conducting the Nakdong river line defense operation, despite having very limited reserves. This gave General McArthur the conditions he desired for the Incheon amphibious operation.
Through the study General McArthur's & General Walker's operational conduct during the Nakdong river line defensive operation in the Korean War, it is impossible to exaggerate their contributions and one may even say they performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the Korean peninsula itself.",나현곤,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101591873
군무원 선발제도 개선 방안 연구,"This study aims to derive the current status and improvement plan of the selection system for military personnel according to the defense reform 2.0, which increases the role of military personnel and expands the quota. The selection of human resources with the importance, expertise, and continuity of the role of military personnel in the defense organization is a decision-making process to select appropriate human resources as a serious task directly related to military combat power. Therefore, it sought to develop a selection system for NCS-based competency-based recruitment, such as job-based competency evaluation and interview evaluation, which are the core of NCS(National Competency Standards)-based competency-based recruitment, and proposed an efficient use of the organization and system.
First, it is necessary to improve the selection system centered on job competency required for the position after hiring by switching to the NCS recruitment process rather than the existing career and theoretical evaluation. Second, it is necessary to review as a way to expand professional interviewers and use them professionally in the interview stage. Third, the Ministry of National Defense and the Army, Navy, and Air Force's military personnel selection organizations are integrated under the Ministry of National Defense to be in charge of selection, thereby establishing a professional and efficient work support system.
The significance of this study can be used as a document based on legal and institutional improvement in relation to the military personnel selection system, and can be provided as basic data related to the military personnel acquisition policy.",정응진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108177182

The targets of the study were private and private first class of Army of Navy and Air Force of six units that were allowed to be surveyed under the ‘Military security services directive’ and ‘Troop information and education activities regulation’. The first survey was conducted from August 10, 2013 to September 24, 2013, the second survey was carried out from November 6, 2016 to September 9, 2016 and the result was compared and analyzed. The data were analyzed using the SPSS 21.0 program, and the analysis techniques used were frequency and percentage, factor analysis and reliability verification, correlation analysis, t-test, one-way variable analysis, and regression analysis.
The results of this study are as follows.
First, most of the results of the first and second studies were similar and this secured the results of the study.
Second, upon looking at the result of relationship between religious tendencies and variables, self-esteem was a significant relationship to intrinsic religious orientation, and self-control, stress response and adjustment to military life were significant to both intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation.
Third, self-esteem, self-control and stress response in relation to internal religious orientation and military Service adaptation have been shown to be mediated effect. These results suggest that religious tendencies (internal and external) have a significant impact on new generation of soldier who live away from his family and need to adapt to a hierarchical and controlled military organization for their duty.",김종효,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105964471

4차 산업혁명 시대 국방혁신 4.0 추진을 위한 주요 방위사업관리체계 RPA 적용방안 연구,"In this study, a development plan was proposed through a pilot project to prepare a plan to apply RPA to the major defense project management system to promote defense innovation 4.0 in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. The research procedure was conducted in the Defense Acquisition Program Administration’s major defense project management system using RPA applicable work judgment (step 1), pilot project target selection (step 2), pilot project execution (step 3), and performance analysis (step 4). For the purpose of the study, four projects were selected, including “private ○○ work,” “○○ review work,” “○○ list ○○ management work,” and “○○ organization work,” focusing on relatively small tasks rather than large-scale tasks. Three items were selected as evaluation items: work overview, applicability evaluation, and risk, and RPA software applied “CheckMate,” which has the strength of shortening work processing time due to virtual bot and parallel processing functions. As a result of the analysis, it was recognized that the definition and analysis of the requirements of the actual user were important to apply RPA to the actual field. In addition, when applying RPA, it is judged that there is a positive effect such as improving work efficiency, improve work efficiency, improve work hours. In the future, it is expected that it will be used as a reference for defining requirements such as processing time per unit work and the number of monthly savings personnel and setting analysis items when reviewing the feasibility of applying RPA.",김기환,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108569455

Heungnam withdrawal during the Korean War regarding dealing with refugees and learn a lesson from it. NoGun-Ri massacre is the incident that lots of civilians were killed or injured by the US Army on the way of retreat. Op. Heungnam withdrawal is the largest withdrawal action at sea in the history. The combined forces had to pull out of Heungnam because of participation of Chinese troops. In the process of carrying out the operation, Refugees of nearly one hundred thousand tried to evacuate and follow the troops. The lessons are as follow.
First, it takes commander's effort to protect civilians' lives & human rights. Second, in the aspect of military strategy, armed forces needs to consider how to control refugees, how to hunt out spies among refugees and how to accept North korean defectors. Third, in war time, civilians must be protected and war crimes like civilians massacres must be prevented.

중국 핵무기 개발의 네 가지 원동력,"This paper focuses on ‘how’ China developed nuclear weapons, and what factors affected to change China's perception of nuclear bomb from the “paper tiger” to “effective means of coercion to imperialism. ” To this end, four driving factors are analyzed.: ‘international structure,’ ‘events,’ ‘organizations,’ and ‘technology. ’Through the case study, this paper argues that. First, to acquire nuclear technology highlighted the importance of the constraints of the international structure. Second, the events in the 1950s, for instance the Taiwan crisis, Sino-Soviet dispute, the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution, had direct impacts on the internal development organizations and management. Finally, ‘organizations’ and ‘technology’ also have a ‘constituitive’ influence on ‘events’ or ‘international system. ’In seeking an explanation for the success of China’s nuclear program, we should further research on China’s military and nuclear strategy. In other words, the debates about China’s national strategy after the Korean Armistice, and during the Great Leap Forward or the Cultural Revolution, were based on Mao’s ‘People’s war’ and not independent of one another. And now, how nuclear strategy evolved itself in the structural transitions, such as ‘Detente’and the post-Cold War should be treated seriously. Based on these, we can discuss on issues such as nuclear disarmament and Peace system in northeast Asia.",손한별,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101591868

This trend will become more emerging in future wars. This paper demonstrates such cyberwarfare development trend by analyzing cyber operation cases, including the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war. Primarily, we apply the novel classification and comparison tool, OpTEAL cube, which reflects the operation level, target effect, and action layer of the cyber operations to classify their characteristic.
While cyberwarfare was not considered a military option in traditional hybrid warfare, it has changed. We suggest establishing the military art system of cyber operations for joint operations integrated with physical military operations.

남북한 접경지역의 평화와 위기관리 - 서해 NLL을 중심으로 -,"While the inter-Korean relationship has undergone a great degree of progress since the two summit meetings, the conflicts surrounding the Northern Limit Line(NLL) are yet to be resolved.NLL is one of the main reasons for the inter-Korean conflict and marks the frontline of crises.While it has served as a maritime borderline as well as a symbol of the armistice agreement,South and North Korea’s different interpretations on the NLL has not only created mutual hostility but escalated into serious national crises,as proven by the repeated engagements in the Yellow Sea and the shellng provocation of Yeonpyeong island. Therefore,the issue of the NLL and the Yellow Sea’s Five Islands stand as a key to the crisis management on the Korean Peninsula. In addition, border region such as the Northern Limit Line and the Demilitarized Zone(DMZ) bear the possibility for future peace and reunification of the Peninsula.To this end,understanding the inter-Korean relationship requires a multilateral approach. In order to prevent future conflict and alleviate tension, peaceful utilization of the bordered sea area must be sought in place of territorial belligerence.Perceiving the NLL as a bordering space rather than adivisive line, is most required. Then, an effort to utilize the border region will spur the mutual interests of South and North Korea. In a confrontational environment, the NLL issue may seem s as a matter of right or wrong.

This paper includes a throughout review of the commentaries published in Japanese main newspapers at those times to objectively assess Japan’s policy toward Jhosun regarding Imo Mutiny. As Japanese were killed and their legation was burnt down, Japan had to take people’s opinion into account in handling this incident.
An analysis of the then Japanese opinion shows that the terms desired by Japanese government made an excessive demand on Japanese people. Especially, most newspapers were criticizing about a core clause, which is about imposing 500 thousand yen of indemnity payment, on Jemulpo Convention. Even Tokyo nichinichi sinbun, a government-friendly newspaper, insisted a reduction of the payment, and Jiji sinpou which had constantly took extremely strong attitude also emphasized immediate return of indemnity payment after receiving it.

예비전력분야 연구 및 교육역량 확충 방안에 관한 연구: 예비전력연구소 설립을 중심으로,"Since the establishment of the ROK Army’s reserve forces in 1968, the reserve forces have been serving as an axis of national defense. Reserve power has become more important due to changes in the security environment, war paradigm, and changes in the military structure due to population decline.
Although the ROK government is pushing for the standardization of reserve forces through defense reform plan, it is still far behind in the power enhancement project or the improvement of combat capabilities of ROK Army’s standing forces. In particular, it is insufficient to train professional research institutes and experts to improve mid- and long-term policies and systems for reserve power.
To improve this, two policy recommendations are proposed. First, a research institute specializing in reserve power should be established. The Reserve Power Research Center of the Korea National Defense University should be a case with the parent of the Reserve Power Research Center. It should be located at the Korea National Defense University to support public policy research and education on reserve power. Second, in order to train experts, a master's and doctorate course at the Korea National Defense University should be institionalized, and education hours should be increased in the training process so that executives, who are in the military, can command the unit with a balanced view of standing and reserve power.

Military provocations such as North Korea's nuclear tests, missiles, land mines, and NLL invasions have not ceased. In particular, it is estimated that the 6th nuclear test carried out at Punggye-ri on September 3, 2017 is about 10 times that of 'Little boy', which was dropped to Japan in 1945. A nuclear bomb that is smaller than the nuclear test estimates shows that up to 6.3 million people will be killed or injured if they blow up from Seoul. This is a situation that can occur sufficiently between the current tensions between North and South Korea, which is possible because it is a nuclear weapon. In this paper, we will examine the North Korean policy of the previous government and examine the three-axis system, the tactical nuclear relocation, and self nuclear armament, which are currently available in Korea.
