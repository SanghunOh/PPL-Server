The result of the war will not only bring about a change in the international order at least in Europe and complicate the United States and China, especially the latter’s strategic calculations. Against this background, the article will examine the prospective results of the war from three different perspectives. They are Ukraine’s victory, Russia’s victory, and a compromise that entails a peace treaty between the two. What these scenarios will imply to the international order will be analyzed. What each result will mean to the US-China’s strategic competition will be explored. In this vein, some policy suggestions to Korean government will be presented in the conclusion.",주재우,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108215879
통일비용과 남북협력기금,"The purpose of the paper is to estimate an optimal size of the inter-Korean Cooperation Fund. The inter-Korean Cooperation Fund was established by the South Korean Government to support the cooperation and exchange between the South and North Korea on the purpose of the reduction of tension and the peaceful unification in the Korean peninsula.
From the German unification experience, we learned that the unification cost was too costly to the German people. The German government spent 5% of GDP annually for 10 years after unification in order to reduce the economic gap between the East and West Germany.
Currently the North Korean economic situation gets much worse than that of the former East Germany. If the unification is achieved under the current situation, the South Korea will face unbearable economic burden, therefore the South Korean government should increase the size of the inter-Korean Cooperation Fund in order to mitigate costly unification cost in the future, In consideration of the German experience, we suggest that the optimal annual accumulation of the Fund be 3% of GDP.",신동천,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76521842
지방소멸 위기에 대응하는 정책 수립 방안에 대한 연구: 인구이동 결정요인 분석을 중심으로,"Recently, Many locals are suffering ‘Regional Extinction’. To overcome the regional extinction problem, we need to consider both ‘Natural factor’ and the ‘Social factor’ of demographic structure changes. But most of the previous research are only concentrated on just one factor of the demographic structure changes. So this study balancedly analysis both natural factor and social factor of demographic structure changes. The result of the analysis is that, higher ‘Rate of the decent job in local’ is important factor of increasing population in both natural and social factor. In detail, natural factor of population growth is not only ‘rate of the decent job in local’ but also ‘Economic growth rate of local’, ‘Local’s financial independence’, and the ‘Employment rate of 20s’. In social factor of population growth, entire, 20s, 30s population moves to the area that have a higher ‘rate of the decent job in local’. Also, entire, 20s, 40s, 50s population moves to the area where there are many ‘Medical welfare facilities’. In addition population of the 30s get out of the area where ‘Lease price’ is high. As a result, the demographic structure changes make difference by the factor(natural or social) and the age group of the population. By the result of this study, we can make an appropriate policy for each locals to influx of the population.",김정식,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732390
"미국, 이스라엘, 그리고 이스라엘-팔레스타인 평화 전망 모델","The United States and Israel have formed a special relationship, and they have exercised dominant influence over the Palestinian region based on superior strength. However, the prospect for achieving peace in the Palestinian region remains distant, and as demonstrated by terrorist acts such as the 9.11 incident, the conflict in the region continues to play a strong factor in escalating tension in the world. Based on these facts, one could conclude that the Palestinian region cannot achieve peace without significant changes on the part of the United States and Israel. Therefore, as a Prospect Model for Peace in the Palestinian region, this research attempts to analyze changes in America's Middle-East policies and Israel's reactions to them. The Obama Administration is trying to switch its role to that of a Middle-Course Mediator, thus bringing fresh hope for peace in Palestine. The newly adopted Mediator role will face for much resistance and create conflict within Israel; however, it will contribute to bringing peace in the Palestinian region through cooperation in the international community and other Muslim countries. The implementation of the Middle-Course Mediator role is being delayed as it faces internal resistance and fierce opposition from Israel. Israel is inducing policies that favor itself, as it always has. President Obama himself acknowledged difficulties in achieving his initial objectives in promoting peace in the region. The Obama Administration's successful promotion of peace in the region depends on whether it can act as an unbiased mediator while simultaneously securing its national interests and successfully dealing with the numerous obstacles it currently faces. Also, as the international community points out, it is a task that will take significant amount of time.","윤형호(Yoon, Hyeong-Ho)",2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82363753
여성 징병제 선호 분석:누가 찬성하고 누가 반대하는가?,"This study analyzes voters’ preferences for female conscription. The preference for the female conscription policy is a complex object and can vary according to gender, generation, and ideology. In particular, we argue that the influence of gender on the female conscription policy differs dependent on generation and ideology. To examine this argument empirically, we analyze survey results regarding the female conscription policy. According to the regression results of this study, women are more likely to agree to the female conscription policy than men, and progressive voters tend to support the female conscription policy than conservative voters. Furthermore, this study shows that the gender effects are more prominent among the old and conservatives.",박진수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108589409

To do so, it does a comparative study of Korean, Norwegian and Swedish cases. It finds that social discussions on women conscription in Korea results in gender conflict, whereas Norway and Sweden introduced women conscription systems to strengthen gender equality and national security capabilities. From its comparative study, this study provides three policy suggestion to enlarge women's role in the national armed service: 1) activating social discussion for women conscription and women's participation in the national armed service; 2) balancing between gender equality and security capabilities; and 3) prioritizing the improvement of working environment and treatment for women's military service.",박진수,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105989179
우크라이나 전쟁: 군수지원 차원에서 본 시사점과 정책 제언,"In the Ukraine War, the Russian military seems to have struggled in the early stages of the war due to the following problems in Logistics.
First, it is a problem in military reform. Russia has been pushing for military reform since 2008, but it is believed that it has not invested sufficient defense spending due to corruption and international sanctions. The injected defense expenditure also prioritized the introduction of weapons for display such as strategic weapons, neglecting the internal stability to operate actual combat power such as truck, communications equipment etc, and even weapons for display were not properly distributed compared to its political propaganda. Meanwhile, problems such as changing the formation of a battalion tactical team optimized for regional conflicts rather than regular warfare and the professionalism of conscripts also seem to have had a negative impact on the war.
Second, it is the war capability and preparation aspect of the military field in peacetime. Compared to Western countries of the same class, Russia lacked logistics units and experience in regular warfare. In addition, due to the influence of mass militarism, the military culture, which focused on the number of equipment and lacked interest in the maintenance of equipment, took more time to work due to the lack of modernization of logistics units. Moreover it had insufficient supplementation of war materials after the previous war. In the situation, preparations for the Ukraine war itself were insufficient, with miscalculation of ending the war in short period of time.
Meanwhile, in addition to the Russian military's insufficient capabilities during the war, international sanctions against Russia and support for Ukraine played an important role. Russia's attack on Ukraine's military base is expected to affect Ukraine in the long run.
The lessons in terms of Korean logistics seen through the Ukraine war are as follows.
First, in order to enhance combat capability, it is necessary to strengthen existing logistics and improve problems in the overall logistics sector. In so doing the organization rate of Korean logistics units is reinforced or if it is practically difficult, the logistics unit mobilization system should be reorganized. In addition, the C4I and communication capabilities of insufficient Korean logistics units should be strengthened, measures should be taken to acquire and train professional military personnel, and stockpile and equipment should be maintained and managed for actual use during wartime. Meanwhile, in the process of defense innovation, privatization of logistics units should be promoted by considering wartime together, not just economic benefit. The issue of the supply of Russian battalion tactical group has been exposed a lot in the war, and the practical ability of logistics units to support the Korean mechanized units and brigades needs to be strengthened, and measures to ensure the subsequent logistics support should be verified.
Second, it is necessary to develop wartime procurement and acquisition through international cooperation and civilian-military cooperation. In particular, in case the war is prolonged, it is necessary to develop wartime overseas procurement suitable for the era of hyper-connected information. We should strengthen the education of soldiers to enhance the image of the wartime state, such as compliance with the war law, from peacetime, and develop ways to actively publicize our efforts as part of the hybrid war. Meanwhile, the military and the private sector should jointly research and develop the two new hybrid war patterns, the strengthening of national leaders' acquisition activities and the connection between global companies and the community. On the other hand, cooperation with friendly countries such as allies and wartime support countries should be strengthened, and problems with mobilization and wartime domestic procurement should be verified at the national def...",박주경,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108215821
반도체 공급망 안보의 국제정치: 미국의 ‘Fab4(Chip4)’ 제안의 시사점,"In recent years, the United States has been spurring the reorganization of its semiconductor supply chain centered on its own country through security considerations, even if it takes a huge cost burden, and is trying to implement it through the formation of Fab4 with Korea, Japan and Taiwan. This study argues that the Fab 4 initiative of the United States should be understood not only as a matter of competitive advantage of specific technologies or reorganization of partnerships, but also in a new geopolitical context in which technology-economy-security is closely combined.
When reorganizing the supply chain around Fab 4, Korea needs strategic consideration in line with its context. ‘Strengthening the super-gap strategy in the field of technology superiority’, ‘Utilizing Fab4 as a means of protecting against external threats’, ‘Exercising strategic flexibility in the process of reorganizing the GVC-RVC-TVC supply chain’, and ‘Avoiding excessive security discourse and balancing economic and security’ will be an option to secure Korea's national interests in the uncertainty of supply chain reorganization.",윤정현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108505645

To establish a theoretical framework for analyzing this relationship, it pays attention to Hannah Arendt’s concept of loneliness. The discussion of this paper proceeds as follows. First, it examines the philosophical, social, and political significance of loneliness through Arendt’s analysis. Second, it explores why the emergence of interactive artificial intelligence can be a significant variable in the age of loneliness. It pays attention to the changes that can occur when the form of technology intersects with the changed way of human life.

존 스튜어트 밀의 ‘여성의 종속’과 자유주의 페미니즘,"John Stuart Mill, who is called a pioneering thinker of liberal feminism, saw that women's subordination was due to social oppression and miseducation of women. Because women and men grow up in different environments, there is a difference in their abilities, so if women are given a lot of freedom of choice and equal opportunities with men, they can also demonstrate their potential abilities. As a thinker who does not show any conflict between words and actions, Mill is also the first politician to develop efforts to improve women's status through his books and actual politics. Mill's argument is necessary not only for women, but also for the development of mankind as a whole. However, Mill's argument is criticized as elitism targeting middle-class women because he insisted on giving voting rights to a select few women and expanding education for a small number of women. However, considering the situation of the West in the 19th century, Mill's argument was a very innovative argument and it can be evaluated that it had a great influence on the current realization of gender equality in that it dealt with the most fundamental issue of women's issues.",조희원,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108407630
한국 언론의 저출산 담론의 구성: 동아일보와 경향신문의 ‘저출산’ 보도를 중심으로,"The Korean government has been making long-term responses to the problem of low fertility by establishing the Basic Plan for a Low-Fertility and Older Society every five years since 2006, but the trend of low fertility is intensifying. Under these circumstances, this paper aims to reveal which discourses on fertility have been mainstreamed and which have been marginalized in the Korean media over the past two decades. To this end, we analyzed the frequent words that appeared in the 'low birthrate' reports of two representative mainstream newspapers, the Dong-A Ilbo and the Kyunghyang Shinmun, and conducted a textual analysis of the main opinion articles in which these words appeared. The results showed that the issue of low birthrate was covered most frequently around 2018, when the total fertility rate dropped to less than 1. In contrast, policy coverage was not particularly active during the years when the new basic plan was announced or the presidential election. In terms of the keywords and content that were actively covered in both newspapers, the Dong-A Ilbo emphasized private participation in solving the low birthrate problem from the beginning, and was critical of the free childcare debate. The Kyunghyang Shinmun, in common with the Dong-A Ilbo, covered jobs as the most important issue from the beginning, and in that context, it tended to focus on the poor economic conditions of the younger generation, unlike the Dong-A Ilbo, which emphasized economic revitalization. Over time, both media have tended to reiterate the traditional discourse of emphasizing economic factors, despite the complexity of the problem's causes and solutions. This study suggests that Korean mainstream media need to pay attention to the multilayered aspects of the declining birthrate and present more diverse diagnoses and solutions.",허윤철,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108665753
프레이밍효과(framing effects)에 대한 설문실험연구,"This research is to examine framing effects on 14 policy issues. Among them, 8 framing trials turned out to be statically significant. That means many of participants in the experimental survey changed their preferences resorting to the direction intended by framing trials. Failed 6 framing trials seem to be caused by either nature of issues or instrumental failures.
This paper's findings are summed up as follows. First, mass audience are neither accustomed to interpret new information and then make a choice nor willing and able to critically review the framed information. Instead mass audience are likely to automatically resonate to the facts, considerations, and values chosen and emphasized by frames.
Second, information available for now provided by frames are likely to affect change of policy preferences. Framing functions through the effects of visibility, saliency and accessibility of the given information.
Third, framing effects are limited or constrained by the nature of issue. Framing effects, especially group cue framing effects, on valence or non-partisan issues are hardly successful. Mass audience do rarely change their policy preferences simply because of in-group consciousness.",류재성,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105989178
블라인드 채용은 정의로운가?: 메리토크라시와 운평등주의적 검토,"This article examines whether the blind-recruitment system is coherent with justice. The present Korean government believes that it is a more just process to decide on hiring by “skills” other than the school or academic background. However, if blind employment is simply replacing education background to job skills in recruitment process, it may difficult to achieve the policy goals of “fairness” and “justice” because it cannot correct the unjust influences of inequality caused by different social conditions of each candidate. This result also contradicts the vision of the present government, ‘inclusive state’. In contrast to the purpose, the blind-recruitment system purses Meritocracy.

［2］As a genius, Park was born irregular son in a poor family.Being a concubine of small land-lord,his mother managed a tavern.His brievances, which he had experienced in his child-boyhood seriously effected his political behavior afterwards.After studies ay regular schools, he was indulged in the domestic commumist movement.On the other side, Kim Il-sung was born in Christain family,amd connected with Communism,while being exiled with his father in Manchuria.On the Liberation day,he was captain of 88 Bribade in Red Army.

(2) In the divice fo antional indepentent fight, Park preferred to Lenin's vanguard theory,but Kim stepped on populism.
(3) Park and Kim clashed with the building of North Korean Branch of Korean Communist party.
Park wanted to control the North Korean Commnnist including Kim under the principle of ""One-party in One-state,""
But Kim,backed by the Red Army in North Korea,proclaimed to establish the North Korean Labor Party under the name of ""distinct situation.""
(4) In the process of 3 parties merge of Korean Communist Party,Korean Peoples Party and Korean New Democratic Party, Park wanted to stand on the center of leftist circle but failed.Kim wished to merge the three parties around Ryu Woon-hyung.When it failed,Kim concluded that Park's secrtarianism was reaponsible to it.

To demonstrate the credibility of extended deterrence, both sides will carry out regular and upgraded joint military exercises that include the mobilization of US strategic weapons and a beefed-up missile defense system. The ROK and the US will invite Japan to participate in joint military exercises to strengthen trilateral military cooperation as well.

지방선거를 통해 살펴본 청년정치의 한계와 가능성,"The purpose of this thesis is to examine the participation and limitations of youth in local politics through the current status of youth political representation in local elections and voters' perceptions of young politicians, and to derive improvement tasks. Although local politics is a field of grassroots democracy and youth political participation is positively recognized, the results of the study show that youth participation in local governments and local councils is rather low. This is the part that differentiates them from women who have gradually increased their representation in local councils despite being of the same political minority.
As a result of the perception survey, voters perceive that young politicians may lack experience or competency compared to established politicians, but are more honest and reformative, and there were many opinions that the number of youth lawmakers should be increased to represent the interests of young people. And as a way to do that, they see that it is important to foster young politicians and expand their nominations by political parties, and there were many positive responses to the introduction of the youth quota system.
In the 21st National Assembly, efforts were made to systematically expand the political representation of young people through amendments to related laws, such as lowering the age at which the right to vote and the age of party membership were lowered, and the establishment of a youth recommendation subsidy and youth political development fund. In addition to these institutional reforms, the political participation of young people can be expanded when the party's efforts to discover and appoint young politicians are paralleled.",이정진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108248411

한반도 정전체제와 북핵체제를 넘어: 불완전 주권성의 전개와 극복,"This article explores how the armistice system has changed since the Korean War, and analyzes the process of change in inter-Korean relations in each period regarding changes in the sovereign status of the two Koreas, the balance of military power between the two Koreas, and the international political structure. As the Cold War ended, the North Korean nuclear regime emerged. The process of the North Korean nuclear issue, subsequent changes in the North Korean nuclear issue, and changes in the armistice system on the Korean Peninsula are also important research topics. Although it is difficult to see the North Korean nuclear regime as a comprehensive system that completely replaces the armistice regime, North Korea neutralizes the armistice regime through nuclear development in the face of the post-Cold War US unipolarity, the military imbalance between the two Koreas, and the situation on the Korean Peninsula led by South Korea. It is differentiated in that it promoted military power and sought survival.
