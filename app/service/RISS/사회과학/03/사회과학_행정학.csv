Adding on previous research on violence against teachers by students, this study gave attention to the role and the perception of parents.
Out of 449 press releases during the last three years with the key words ""violence against teacher,"" 269 articles were collected and used to estimate the prevalence of violence against teachers. The results showed an interesting pattern that more violence against teachers were committed by parents than by students.
As well, the analyses of online survey of 424 parents from elementary, middle, and high schools showed that those parents who had higher perceptions of general violence against teachers in our society and schools were likely to had higher perceptions of provability of violence against teachers in the school where their children was associated. On the other hand, those parents who showed a higher evaluation of their schools expressed lower provability of violence against teachers.
Suggestions for the policy and future research were discussed based on the findings.",최선옥,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105122194

소년법 폐지론 문제점과 대안 연구,"Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development. Such differences constitute the basis for the recognition of lesser culpability, and for a separate system with a differentiated, individualized approach.
Recently, because of the expanding cruel crimes of the children in Korea, the issue of abolishing ‘Child Law’ became very hot in Korea. Influenced by that strong opinion of the society, Korean Government has a plan to lower the minimum criminal age of the child from age 14 to age 13.
On the contrary to this plan, UN Committee on the Rights of the Child(CRC) promotes key strategies for reducing the especially harmful effects of contact with the criminal justice system. Korea, a member of the CRC, needs to follow the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
This thesis analyzed Korean child crime statistics. However, the results of this analysis shows no urgent and clear need to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility. Suggested alternatives to promote the prevention of child crime as a policy not to abolish ‘Child Law’ of Korea; expand the long term of the child custody institution period from 2 year to 3 year, enlarge the child custody facilities, and lower the age of the children who participate in the rehabilitation educations from 12 year to 10 year.",홍성삼,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106841327
한국에서 ‘묻지마 범죄’의 개념적 실체에 관한 소고,"The fear of crime is aggravated by the media reports of so-called ‘motiveless crime’(or ‘Mut-ji-ma’ crime in Korean), of which offenders randomly hurt people with unclear motive. However, the definition of ‘motiveless crime’ has not yet been established, and each study uses different concepts and labels. Thus, through a systematic literature review of 20 published studies on ‘motiveless crime’in Korea, this study examined whether or not ‘motiveless crime’ could exist as a unique phenomenon by analyzing the concept in terms of crime type and measurement. According to the legal definition of crime, ‘motiveless crime’ could not be clearly defined because it does not meet the constitutional element of a specific crime. In addition, according to the crime type classification, ‘motiveless crime’ was used as a modifier to emphasize certain nature of the violent offence. As an offender characteristic, ‘motiveless criminals’ tend to have motives similar to other criminals. The distinctions among offender subtypes were not clear. Furthermore research methods used in some studies were not objective and some researchers used the same data to produce different categorization results, which caused a circular logic error. This study concluded that ‘motiveless crime’ could not be a unique phenomenon with a measurable definition, and suggested treating the ‘motiveless crime’ as a modifier rather than an independent crime concept.",문혜민,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108109232

However, although various studies have been conducted on juvenile drug crimes, the fact that this study investigated the perceptions of scientific investigators that have not been dealt with so far can be said to be different from previous studies. Therefore, this study analyzed the effectiveness of preventive education centering on the scientific investigators of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency to control the increase of juvenile drug crime. According to the analysis, policy factors were the highest, and the enforcement factors and punishment factors had a positive effect on the effectiveness of preventive education. In other words, in order to increase the effectiveness of drug prevention education for adolescents, it is necessary to further strengthen the punishment for drug-supplying criminals, and activate treatment and rehabilitation policies for drug-using criminals. In addition, the effectiveness of drug prevention programs should be enhanced by establishing governance systems with the Ministry of Justice, schools, local police agencies, local governments and private institutions. In addition, institutional changes are needed to unify the control and management of drug crimes by establishing the 'Police Agency Drug Administration'. The results of this study are expected to be helpful in finding effective policy directions for the prevention of juvenile drug crimes in the future.",김태우,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107325409
정책의 논거와 상징으로서의 수: 의과대학 정원확대정책의 타당성 논쟁,"Numbers are often used as evidence in favor of or against a policy. The policy to increase the quota of medical schools has been pursued by the politicians for a long time, and on July 23, 2020, when the government announced the policy, it caused serious controversy and conflict. In the course of this controversy, numbers were used as evidence and symbols to support or oppose the policy. As an evidence for the policy under the cause of alleviating health care disparity and the shortage of doctors in essential medical services, the number of doctors per 1,000 people compared to OECD countries was presented. Opponents criticized the policy’s validity by presenting various numbers such as medical care accessibility, national health index, density of doctors, and rate of change in population and doctors. Numbers are a persuasive means of eliciting support for policies, but the selective use of numbers with specific intentions distort problems and lead to wrong policy decisions.

Hence, it is urgent to discuss the preparation of active countermeasures at the national level for the prevention and treatment of drug addiction.
Therefore, this study examines the actual state of drug use and considers the necessity of legislation to prevent the recurrence of drug use by analyzing the state of national policies for recurrence prevention and rehabilitation, overseas cases, and related legislative progress. As a result of the study, first, the number of drug offenders is on the rise, and among them, those under the age of 29 are showing a rapid increase. The number of deaths due to drug use is also on the rise and if the current level of response is met, the problem is expected to intensify.

Treatment and rehabilitation infrastructure and budget are incredibly insufficient unlike the United States and Germany. Third, legislation for the prevention and treatment of drug addiction was attempted for about 20 years, but the actual results were insignificant. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a national addiction management integrated system by enacting and revising laws for the prevention and treatment of drug addiction and to prepare the basis for practical prevention policies, treatment, and social rehabilitation.",양혜정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108403684

마약범죄의 한계와 효율적 통제를 위한 제언,"As drug crimes become a very serious problem all over the world, various measures are suggested to analyze the cause and solve the problem. Drug abuse-related problems are currently considered not just a personal matter, but a national issue. Drug crimes therefore have varying definitions such as international crime, victimless crime, etc. and punishment is perceived differently depending on each country's social and cultural background.
Drug crimes are attributed to direct or indirect causes including an individual attempt to escape from reality, intended abuse by criminal groups, crimes committed by drug addicts to buy expensive drugs, and secondary crimes committed in drug-induced hallucinations.
Transnational drug crimes threaten the country's economic activity and national security, so it is required to recognize the seriousness of drug crimes at national and society levels.
Accordingly, comprehensive countermeasures need to be developed by establishing related criminal policies, laws, and institutions.

The literature on digital sex crimes began being published in the early 2000’s, but the number increased dramatically in 2017 when the government introduced its plan to fight digital sex crimes. The early expressions used most frequently were ‘cyber sexual violence’ and ‘cyber pornography’, while ‘online sexual violence’ appeared in the 2010’s. Since 2017, ‘digital sex crimes’ and ‘digital sexual violence’ have became the favored expressions in academia; legal terms, phrases that underlie the non-consensual or illicit nature of the crime, as well as expressions translated directly from English started to be used.

However, more than 20 years later, there is no adequate measure to determine Hikikomori proliferation. What is the reason why there were no studies conducted to determine the exact number of these loners? This researcher and the team wanted to reveal why such a survey on the status of Hikikomori in Korea was not conducted. Moreover, we tried to determine Korea's unique socio-cultural characteristics that make it difficult to measure the number of Hikikomori individuals accurately.
(Design/methodology/approach) This study is not designed to discover and contact young people who have isolated themselves in a small room to avoid contact with society. However, this research utilized secondary literature to emphasize the theoretical aspects of the Hikikomori phenomenon.
(Findings) Korea's educational fervor and the honor-shame cultural principle drive certain young people to be Hikikomori. The parents of these individuals conceal the fact that their children are isolated in the rooms because they do not want to reveal that their children are failures. Therefore, the lack of data and accurate numbers is unable to make the public consider and aware of Hikikomori a significant social issue.

The sample was 45 homicide cases of which the verdicts were delivered from January of 2015 to June of 2021 in the Seoul district courts. The results of stepwise selection multiple regression analysis showed that the planned murder and cruel methods within the sentencing guidelines had a significantly positive effect on sentencing. Objecting to punish perpetrator by imprisonment by victims's side had a significantly negative effect on sentencing. It means that the former two factors increase the sentencing of mental disorder homicide criminals, and the latter reduce the sentencing of mental disorder homicide criminals. Although schizophrenia was the most common mental disorder of the accused, it did not significantly influence sentencing. The defendant’s mental disorder type evidences did not have a significant effect on sentencing.

분노범죄의 발생원인과 대응방안에 관한 연구,"In this study, we recognized the seriousness of crimes of passion occurring in our society. In result, in this study, we have looked into the cause of crimes of passion and tried to find out an effective countermeasure. We searched for the cause increasing this kind of crimes for the past 5 years. The case study findings of the analysis among the incidents that brought on public criticism show some interesting points.
Factors causing crimes of passion can be divided into a personal cause and a social, environmental cause. Crime occurrence related with the personal cause usually occurs when personal accumulated stress and pent-up anger burst out at once. In some cases, anger control disorder that makes anger management not easy for some individual can also be the trigger of crimes of passion. If we look into the terms of social and environmental cause of crime, crimes occur when family ties are weakened or societal prejudice and frustration cause complaints about reality. Especially, crime is more likely to occur to underprivileged who lacks ongoing care and support from the society.
Therefore, a variety of psychological therapies should be applied to solve stress under the constant interest and support of the nation. In addition, a social safety net should be established through collaboration with various organizations.
However, among the most important is that crimes of passion should be recognized as a social problem, that needs constant attention and efforts from the national and local communities, not as a personal illness or disorder.","오세연(Oh, Sei Youen)",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103046370

아동 대상 성범죄자의 범죄심리학적 특성에 관한 고찰,"Sex crimes against children stir utmost resentment among the public and increase fear for crimes due to the cruelty and brazenness of the crimes themselves, thus emerging as serious social issues in recent years. Thus this study reviewed articles about sex crimes against children in national daily newspapers from August, 2009 to July, 2010 and analyzed the criminal psychological characteristics of the offenders as part of the process of preparing fundamental countermeasures against sex crimes against children since feasible countermeasures can only be prepared through accurate analysis and understanding.
According to the analysis results of the crimes, the sexual offenders against children widely varied in age and mostly either engaged in simple labor or were unemployed. Their criminal histories caused concern for second offenses, laced with similar or the same kind of previous convictions and mental disorders. The child victims were usually girls aged from 7 to 13. The types of sex crimes against the children were rape and indecent assault in many cases. What was noteworthy about the places of crimes was that the crimes tended to take place near the residence of offenders or victims in a bold fashion. There were differences in the places of crimes according to the relationships between offender and victim. The offenders used either allurement or violence as a means of crime, and most of them devised thorough plans before actually committing them.
When social attention is concentrated on sex crimes against children, people get upset and demand for tougher punishment. Once the public interest fades away, however, various countermeasures fail to get implemented in many cases. Thus it is critical to consider the characteristics of sexual offenders against children described above and to devise a range of plans including prevention of second offenses through thorough monitoring, support for child victims, education on the prevention of sex crimes, and a network of related organizations.",정승민,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105020643
