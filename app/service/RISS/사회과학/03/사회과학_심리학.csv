The concepts of ""Subjective Well-being""(Diener, 1984) and ""Quality of Life"" are based on the Hedonism; the concepts of ""Psychological Well-being""(Ryff, 1989b) and the ""Flow experience"" are based on the Eudaimonism. The relationship between SW13 and extroversion was well established. Various Quality of Life measures were found to be useful for the various target populations (the elderly, for example). Researches based on the Eudaiomonism were not so much developed and seems to be needed for the future study.",이수정,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75025680

성격장애와 기질 및 성격특질 간의 관계,"Cloninger(1987, 2004) was assumed that naturally inborn temperament affects personality development across the lifetime. If based on this assumption, temperament may be a potent cause of personality disorders. The aim of this study was to verify the relationship between personality disorders (PDs) and each dimension in Korean Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) that based on Cloninger's psychobiological model. Also, we investigated the temperament and character that have each PDs, and examined the character dimensions that can discriminate PDs. The Korean TCI and Personality Disorder Test were administered to 753 university students. We used correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis. As a result, self-Direction (SD) and Cooperativeness (C) were useful indicator for recognizing level of PDs, because SD and C were negative correlation with all cluster of PDs. Cluster A was associated with Harm Avoidance (HA) and Reward Dependence (RD). Cluster B was related Novelty Seeking (NS), cluster C was involved HA. Furthermore, we suggested three-dimensional figure about what kind of relationship between 10 PDs and three temperament dimension (NA, HA, RD).

청소년범죄 유형과 원인 및 예방대책,"This study aims to analyze the types and causes of juvenile crime and to prepare preventive measures.
Juvenile crime is shown in the form of violent crime, property crime, and traffic crime. Robust crime is mainly a sex crime, and the desire for physical development, character problems and immature psychological development are caused by a harmful environment. Violent crime is impulsive violence without clear purpose or motive, such as bullying. Property crime was a part of irrational thinking, excessive consumption tendency, and theft to prepare entertainment expenses. Traffic crimes are associated with a tendency to enjoy adventure in adolescence. The causes of juvenile crime are as follows: First, the family environment is caused by the absence of a parenting environment and character problem. Second, the school environment is caused by stress from excessive competition. Third, adolescents may be influenced by harmful environmental factors. Fourth, the juvenile law has shown that juvenile crime is lighter in sentence than adult crime. The preventive measures are as follows: First, parents are responsible for raising their children correctly. Second, schools should make efforts to cultivate talented people. Third, a healthy social environment must be made for young people. Fourth, the Youth Protection Act and the Juvenile Act should make efforts to reduce juvenile crime. Above all, there is a need for a unified system to manage juvenile offenders over the long term. Finally, members of our society must accept youth offenders with love rather than prejudice.",이용주,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106483720

"자아정체감 지위에 따른 대학생의 진로결정문제, 진로준비행동의 차이","Development ego-identity has been considered as a key factor to successful career decision-making. This present research examined the differences in career decision making difficulties and career preparation behavior between identity achieved and identity foreclosed college students in Korea. To categorize ego-identity statuses, 433 college students from 14 campuses responded to a measure of Identity Status(EOM-EIS) along with the Career Decision Making Difficulties and Career Preparation Behavior Scales. As a result, significant differences were found in lack of readiness and lack of information between identity achieved group and foreclosed group. The foreclosed students showed higher scores in the subscales of career decision-making difficulty(lack of readiness and lack of information) than achieved group. In terms of career preparation behavior, identity foreclosed college students showed no significant difference compared to the identity achieved counterparts. This result implies that the identity foreclosed students experience difficulties of lack-of-readiness and lack-of-information in decision making process, however, in terms of behavioral sense, once they obtained their career goals, they experience less difficulties in pursuing their career goals .

우울증의 신경회로 모형과 인지행동치료의 치료 효과: 기능적 뇌 자기공명영상 연구를 중심으로,"Neuroimaging studies have suggested that dysfunction of neural circuits involved in emotion regulation, cognitive control, and reward processing were associated with the development of depression. We aimed to review functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and its influence on functional changes in neural circuits in patients with depression. fMRI studies reported that CBT was associated with functional changes of neural circuits involved in emotion regulation, cognitive control, and reward processing in depression. They found that CBT was associated with normalization of hyperactivation in the amygdala (in response to negative emotional stimuli) and increased activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, which exerts cognitive control over negative emotions in patients with depression. They also observed that CBT was related to deactivation of the anterior cingulate cortex and increased activity of the striatum in response to reward stimuli. CBT also changed functional connectivity of the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum in depressive patients. Investigation of the neural effect of CBT using fMRI may provide clinically useful information and deep insights about the neurobiological mechanism of CBT in depression.",한규만,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107959675

묻지마 범죄의 특성과 유형: 사례 분석을 중심으로,"Recently, there has been a growing fear of ‘nonspecific motive crime’ in which offender’s motivation is obscure and victims are randomly selected. Especially, not only the fact that victims are targeted by a perfect stranger for no specific reasons, but also the notion that nonspecific motive crime is expected to increase for a while, exacerbate the public’s fear. However, widespread agreement upon the academic definition or conceptualization of ‘nonspecific motive crime’ has not been established yet. Furthermore, detailed statistics of its occurrence have not been identified yet, and only a little research about motivation and psychological features of offenders has been conducted. Therefore, the present study first aimed to examine various causes of nonspecific motive crime, including individual and social factors surrounding the offender. Based on these factors, the present study reviewed several nonspecific motive crimes that occurred in South Korea for recent years. The present study also differentiated nonspecific motive crime into two types-‘the social discontent’ and ‘the insane’-by analyzing the common causes and characteristics of the cases. ‘The social discontent’ refers to offenders who committed crime as their expression of accumulated frustration, dissatisfaction, or anger with the present state of the society, mostly derived from one’s difficult situations, such as loss of employment or poverty. On the other hand, ‘the insane’ refers to the offenders who committed crime mainly because of their mental disorder, such as paranoid schizophrenia and depression. By analyzing the causes and characteristics and differentiating them into types, the present study eventually seeks ways of systematically preventing nonspecific motive crime.

Participants were 293 college students (109 males and 184 females) who completed a set of online self-report questionnaires that measured trauma experience, post-traumatic stress symptoms, post-traumatic growth, event-related rumination, and meaning making. The results of path analysis indicated that intrusive rumination positively predicted deliberate rumination, and deliberate rumination positively predicted both post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth. Moreover, intrusive rumination negatively predicted meaning making, and meaning making negatively predicted post-traumatic stress symptoms and positively predicted post-traumatic growth. Furthermore, there was a sequential mediating effect of deliberate rumination and meaning making on the relationship between intrusive rumination and post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth. In other words, the higher the intrusive rumination, the higher the deliberate rumination, which led to a higher level of meaning making, and meaning making was negatively associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms and positively associated with post-traumatic growth.

반복적 부정 사고에 초점을 맞춘 단기 인지치료프로그램의 우울 및 불안 완화 효과 및 그 기제: 상위인지치료와 인지행동치료의 비교,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects and change mechanisms of the recently emerging metacognitive therapy(MCT) targeting the repetitive negative thinking(RNT), as the transdiagnostic vulnerability factors for depression and anxiety in comparison with cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT). For this purpose, 888 cyber university students were asked to complete a Repeated Thinking Questionnaire-10(RTQ-10), Korean version of Perseverative Thinking Questionnaire(K-PTQ), Beck Anxiety Scale(BAI) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale(CES-D). Among them, 66 people who agreed to participate in the study were selected using the RTQ-10 and K-PTQ scores. The Repeated Measure ANOVA of the group(between subjects variables: MCT, CBT, and waiting-list control group) X period(within subjects variables: pre-treatment, post-treatment, 4-week follow-up) was conducted with depression and anxiety as dependent measures. In addition, MEMORE(Mediation and Moderation for Repeated Measures; Montoya & Hayes, 2017) was used to analyze the mechanism of the effect. First, both the MCT and the CBT showed a greater decrease in depression after the treatment and the follow-up than Waiting-list control group(WLC), but there was no difference in depression between the two treatment groups at the time of the post treatment and follow-up. Also, the reduction of RNT fully mediated the relation between MCT and depression. Results concerning anxiety showed that in MCT anxiety decreased significantly in both post-treatment and follow-up. However, in CBT, anxiety reduction was not significant after the treatment, but significantly decreased only in follow-up suggesting the superiority of MCT over CBT. The decrease of RNT fully mediated the relation between MCT and anxiety. In addition to therapeutic implications to lessen RNT and emotional disorders, the limitations of current study and the directions of future studies were discussed.",김유진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106938046

"마음챙김 기반 프로그램이 상담자의 마음챙김, 자기수용, 자기성찰에 미치는 영향 :프로그램 유형별(요가ㆍ명상ㆍ혼합 프로그램)효과를 중심으로","This study attempted to confirm through experiments how mindfulness-based group programs affect mindfulness, self-acceptance, and self-reflection, which are the areas of self-development of counselors. In addition, by classifying groups by mindfulness intervention factors (yoga, meditation, yogaㆍmeditation mixture), I tried to explore the differences in the aspects of their effects on the measured variables. To this end, a group program for each mindfulness intervention factor was conducted for a total of 8 weeks (once a week, 2 hours/session) for counselors with counseling experience of more than 1 year and less than 5 years, and the control group was conducted without treatment. To measure the effectiveness of the program, a pre-, post-, and follow-up survey (after 4 weeks) was conducted, and data from a total of 53 people (mindful-yoga group 12, mindful-meditation group 13, mindful-yogaㆍmeditation mixed group 14, control group 14) were analyzed. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that the mindfulness-based group program for counseling psychologists improved some of the counselors' self-development areas, mindfulness and self-acceptance, and promoted self-reflection. In addition, it was confirmed that there may be more effective mindfulness intervention factors depending on the characteristics of the measurement variables, and that the time when the effect is revealed may vary depending on the intervention factors. This study has significance in that incumbent counselors directly experienced mindfulness training to verify the effect on the counselor's self-development area and to explore the difference in effect by mindfulness intervention factor.",전경숙,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108490809

"대학생의 취업스트레스, 진로결정자기효능감, 대학생활적응, 우울 및 자살생각 간의 구조적 관계분석","The purpose of this study was to examine structural relationships among college students’ job-seeking stress, career decision-making self-efficacy, adjustment to college life, depression, and suicidal ideation, and to determine direct or indirect effects that those variables have on one another. To achievw these goals, this study used a survey questionnaire with 600 students from four universities located in Busan Metropolitan City. Of those participants, responses from 560 students were used for data analysis. Data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling analysis with SPSS 21.0 and AMOS 20.0. Study finding are as follows. First, college students’ job-seeking stress had a direct effect on their adjustment to college life and depression while. The effects of job-seeking stress on career decision-making self-efficacy and suicidal ideation was not direct but just indirect. Second, college students’ depression had a direct effect on their suicidal ideatioN. Neither of students’ career decision-making self-efficacy or adjustment to college life had a direct effect on their suicidal ideation. Instead, adjustment to college life had an indirect influence on suicidal ideation. Third, college students’ job-seeking stress had an indirect effect on their suicidal ideation through depression as a mediator. College students’ job-seeking stress, adjustment to college life, and depression indirectly influenced their suicidal ideation as the three variables mediated one another in subsequent manners. However, college students’ job-seeking stress had no indirect effect on their suicidal ideation via career decision-making self-efficacy. These findings indicate that job-seeking stress not only makes it more difficult for college students to adapt themselves to college life, but also increase their depression that has much influence on suicidal ideation. Findings also suggest that college students’ adjustment to college life can be a protective factor which reduces their suicidal ideation as the former has an indirect effect on the latter. This findings are meaningful in that why colleges, counselors. and government agencies related to employment should work together to develop and implement year-based customized programs that help prevent college students’ job-seeking stress from leading to their suicidal ideation.",박선영,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107921153

한국 사회문제의 변화: 지난 10년간 세 시점의 비교,"The present study investigated individuals' perception of important social issues in Korea. Based on previous research(Hahn, 1994; Hahn & Kang, 2000), a checklist containing 370 social issues was created. This checklist was administered to 1600 Koreans(812 college students, 788 adults) residing in 5 regional areas in Korea during the period of December 2004 and February 2005. Data were analyzed by the respondents' age, sex, and residing areas, and findings were compared to those of the two previous studies conducted in 1994 and 1999. Major findings of the study are as follows. First, across the three surveys, over 50% of the respondents consistently indicated the following four items as important social issues in the Korean society: political corruption, environmental pollution, the education system that is driven too much for college entrance, employment difficulty for local college graduates. Second, more than 50% of the respondents in the current survey indicated the following 12 items as important social issues that must be resolved: high unemployment rate, political corruption, environmental pollution, education system, overall difficulty of getting jobs, the nation's distrust in politics, hardships of life among the working classes, political incompetence, people with defective personal credit standings, employment difficulty for local college graduates, political instability, corruption of public servants. Third, analyses on the top 30 social issues across the three surveys revealed a positive and significant rank-order correlation for a five-year period(i.e., 1994-1999, 1999-2004), but not for a ten-year period(i.e., 1994-2004).

회귀분석과 구조방정식 모형에서의 상호작용효과 검증 : 이론과 절차,"As behavioral science research advances, third variables have increasingly been considered in the relationship between independent and dependent variables in many research. Research has commonly examined the role of mediating and/or moderating variables. A moderating variable indicates a variable that has an interaction effect on a dependent variable, producing a joint effect with an independent variable. Given that mediation (or indirect) effects can be easily tested in structural equation models that are very widely used, mediation effects are more commonly tested than interaction effects. One of the main possible reasons interaction models are underutilized is that testing interaction effects can be complicated and thus many researchers often experience difficulties. In view of this, analysis methods for testing the interaction effects are explained and discussed in detail using regression analysis and structural equation models in the present study. First, mean centering, correction of standardized interaction coefficient, and reliability issues of interaction variables are explained in regression analysis. Next, constrains of parameters and unconstrained methods as well as the abovementioned three issues are emphasized in structural equation models. In addition, regression analysis and structural equation models are applied to a real data set to explain the procedures of the analysis.

혈액형별 성격특징에 대한 믿음과 실제 성격과의 관계,"Individuals' beliefs about the association between blood types (A, B, O, AB) and personality was measured among 204 college students. Participants also rated their own personality on two different measures-the Big 5 inventory and a set of personality traits most frequently associated with each of the 4 blood types (stereotypic traits). Consistent with past research, no meaningful relationship emerged between the Big 5 traits and blood type. Interestingly, however, self-ratings on the stereotypic traits revealed a self-fulfilling pattern. Those who firmly believed in the validity of the blood type stereotypes were more likely to report his/her trait in a stereotype-consistent direction (e.g., a blood type A person reports that she indeed is very “timid”). As expected, such stereotype-confirming tendency was not observed among the skeptics of this stereotype. Overall, the findings suggest that having a strong faith in the blood type stereotype might have a self-confirming effect on self-reports of personality.",조소현,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104030290

Topics for psychological counseling were “counseling utilization information,” “inquiries about counselor licensure,” “counseling types and modalities,” “counseling as professional area,” and “counselor training/education.” Topics for counselor were “license acquisition,” “art therapy,” “counseling specialities,” “counselor qualification,” and “counseling process and confidentiality.”",이아라,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107495087
청소년의 스트레스 대처방식과 적응과의 관계,"This study was conducted to explore Korean adolescents' coping strategies and their relationship to adjustment, by administering Frydenberg and Lewis(1993a)'s Adolescent Coping Scale. The participants in this study were 1,069 adolescents attending junior or senior high schools located in Seoul or Kyung-Gi. This study examined gender differences and grade differences in the extent to which adolescents used each of the 18 strategies to cope with general stresses, and the relationship between stress coping and adjustment(i.e., GPA, sense of school belonging, interpersonal relation, anxiety, depression, delinquency). The results showed that regardless of gender, adolescents used ‘seek relaxing diversion' most and ‘seek professional help' least to cope with their stresses. However, male adolescents used ‘physical recreation,' ‘keep to self,' and ‘ignore the problem' strategies more frequently than did female adolescents. In contrast, female adolescents were found to cope with their stresses by using ‘seek social support,' ‘seek spiritual support,' ‘focus on solving the problem,' and ‘wishful thinking' strategies more frequently than did male adolescents. Grade differences in the use of coping strategies were also significant. As grades increased, the use of ‘worry,' ‘tension reduction,' ‘give up,' and ‘seek professional help' increased but use of ‘physical recreation' and ‘work hard and achieve' decreased. The results of multiple regression analyses displayed that stress coping strategies explained adolescents' anxiety, depression, sense of school belonging, and interpersonal relation more than their GPA and delinquency. These results implied that understanding of adolescents' coping strategies would provide precise predictors of these indices of adjustment and it would be necessary to understand and intervene with coping strategies of adolescents who are anxious, depressed, lacking in the sense of school belonging, or having difficulty with interpersonal relations. Finally, implications for counseling for Korean adolescents and for further research and limitations of this study were discussed.",신현숙,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102573671

자기결정성이론에 근거한 한국형 기본 심리 욕구 척도 개발 및 타당화,"The purposes of the present study were to develop a basic psychological needs scale based on the Self-determination Theory (SDT) for Korean adolescents and to examine its construct validity. Ryan and Deci's basic psychological needs scale was used as the basis for this Korean version of the scale. Translation and back translation procedures were used along with the qualitative analysis of the results from interview and open-ended questions to modify original items and to construct new items that properly represent Korean concept of the basic psychological needs. The adapted and newly constructed items were administered to 1591 middle and high school students from 10 different schools in Korea. The item and scale base analyses resulted in 18 items (6 items each for the sub-scale of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) as the final version for the Basic Psychological Needs Scale for Korean adolescents. An evidence of construct validity was obtained from a confirmatory factor analysis. The internal consistency of the three sub-scales were relatively high (α=.70, .75, and .79 for the autonomy, competence, and relatedness sub-scales, respectively) considering the number of the items included in each scale. The evidences of concurrent validity were obtained from correlation analyses using students' academic self-regulation scale scores, academic self-efficacy scale scores, and school adjustment scale scores as the criterion measures for autonomy, competence, and relatedness sub-scales, respectively. The evidences of predictive validity were obtained from correlation, simple regression, and standard multiple regression analyses using students' psychological well-being scale scores as the criterion. In conclusion, the results showed that the Basic Psychological Needs Scale based on the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) for Korean adolescents properly measured the theory-consistent construct and significantly predicted external criterion variables. Results were also discussed in relations to the potential utility of the scale.",이명희,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104030396
