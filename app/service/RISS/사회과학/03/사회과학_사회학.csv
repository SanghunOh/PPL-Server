한국과 미국의 노인복지법 비교 연구,"In order to propose some comments related to the Amendments of the Older Koreans Act for the near future, this study analyzes the Older Americans Act and compares it with the Older Koreans Act. The comments proposed are as follows:
First, service programs for the Korean elderly participating at senior centers shoed be provided universally not selectively and current paying-mechanism of fixed charge for some programs for not poor-group of elderly should be substituted by contributory basis.
Second, aging service network for the comprehensive planning, finance, coordination, and delivery of aging services should be initiated and included in the Older Koreans Act.
Third, the national level responsible for the matters related to the welfare for the aged should be escalated. Establishment of the Departrnent of Elder Affairs(tentative name) is suggested.
Fourth, a national research center(institute on aging) conducting studies on the variety of issues on aging should be established and the results founded by the center should be used four the social policies for older Koreans.
Fifth, elder rights protection acts should be initiated and included in the Older Koreans Act. To protect the elderly living in the community as well as in institutional. settings against elder abuse(physical and emotional), neglect, and material exploitation, elder abuse protection act should be initiated. Also the Ombudsman program which advocates for the residents of nursing homes, board and care homes, assisted living facilities and similar adult care facilities, should be initiated.
Sixth, the Korean government's social policy for the elderly, known as `family support first, pubic support next policy', should be changed. A sizable, direct government spending on the welfare programs for the elderly should be made. First priority has given to the Korean traditional value of filial piety and encouragement of adult children to care of their older parents for the welfare policies of the older population. The traditional value, stressing the moral responsibility of adult children to care of their older parents, is not the best device for the welfare of the elderly. The Korean society has been changed dramatically in terms of culture and economy since last few decades.",유성호,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75014024
"자아정체감 지위에 따른 대학생의 진로결정문제, 진로준비행동의 차이","Development ego-identity has been considered as a key factor to successful career decision-making. This present research examined the differences in career decision making difficulties and career preparation behavior between identity achieved and identity foreclosed college students in Korea. To categorize ego-identity statuses, 433 college students from 14 campuses responded to a measure of Identity Status(EOM-EIS) along with the Career Decision Making Difficulties and Career Preparation Behavior Scales. As a result, significant differences were found in lack of readiness and lack of information between identity achieved group and foreclosed group. The foreclosed students showed higher scores in the subscales of career decision-making difficulty(lack of readiness and lack of information) than achieved group. In terms of career preparation behavior, identity foreclosed college students showed no significant difference compared to the identity achieved counterparts. This result implies that the identity foreclosed students experience difficulties of lack-of-readiness and lack-of-information in decision making process, however, in terms of behavioral sense, once they obtained their career goals, they experience less difficulties in pursuing their career goals .

It highlights the need for a local approach to realizing the universal right to health as an alternative to these problems.
The case of sanctuary cities, which are based on jus domicile rather than de jure citizenship has important implications for recognition and rights as a member of the city. ‘Firewall policies’ at the local level can have a positive impact on increasing access to healthcare for migrants.

청소년의 스트레스 대처방식과 적응과의 관계,"This study was conducted to explore Korean adolescents' coping strategies and their relationship to adjustment, by administering Frydenberg and Lewis(1993a)'s Adolescent Coping Scale. The participants in this study were 1,069 adolescents attending junior or senior high schools located in Seoul or Kyung-Gi. This study examined gender differences and grade differences in the extent to which adolescents used each of the 18 strategies to cope with general stresses, and the relationship between stress coping and adjustment(i.e., GPA, sense of school belonging, interpersonal relation, anxiety, depression, delinquency). The results showed that regardless of gender, adolescents used ‘seek relaxing diversion' most and ‘seek professional help' least to cope with their stresses. However, male adolescents used ‘physical recreation,' ‘keep to self,' and ‘ignore the problem' strategies more frequently than did female adolescents. In contrast, female adolescents were found to cope with their stresses by using ‘seek social support,' ‘seek spiritual support,' ‘focus on solving the problem,' and ‘wishful thinking' strategies more frequently than did male adolescents. Grade differences in the use of coping strategies were also significant. As grades increased, the use of ‘worry,' ‘tension reduction,' ‘give up,' and ‘seek professional help' increased but use of ‘physical recreation' and ‘work hard and achieve' decreased. The results of multiple regression analyses displayed that stress coping strategies explained adolescents' anxiety, depression, sense of school belonging, and interpersonal relation more than their GPA and delinquency. These results implied that understanding of adolescents' coping strategies would provide precise predictors of these indices of adjustment and it would be necessary to understand and intervene with coping strategies of adolescents who are anxious, depressed, lacking in the sense of school belonging, or having difficulty with interpersonal relations. Finally, implications for counseling for Korean adolescents and for further research and limitations of this study were discussed.",신현숙,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102573671
"취향, 계급, 구별짓기, 그리고 혐오: 혐오 사회학을 위하여","This essay attempts to develop a sociological theory of disgust that connects class discrimination and disgust, leaning on Pierre Bourdieu’s discussion on taste and distinction. To this end, special attention is given to the point that cultural boundaries can be formed not only through preferences but also through the patterns of disgust. Boundaries between hostile social groups might well be defined by emotions shared by people within the same group, but the aversive and disgusting emotions toward other groups are operating more importantly and more strongly in the ‘boundary work’. Disgust is imposed to beings outside the boundaries that exist between us and them and thus acts a major mechanism to strengthen the boundaries. In particular, Bourdieu’s reading of Kant and ideological criticism of his aesthetic judgment contribute to uncovering the taste and disgust’s ability to differentiate as acquired dispositions do. According to Bourdieu, tastes are, above all, distastes or disgusts provoked by horror or ‘visceral’ intolerance of the tastes of others. In addition, disgust is the enjoyment extorted by symbolic power removing the distance between the representation and the thing represented, envisaging the situation of alienation, “the loss of the subject in the object”. The roles of cultural tastes and their relative ‘disgust’ as powerful differentiating and discriminating forces attract the much interests, which lead to the conclusion that class identity and subjectivity are constituted by disgust toward other classes.",하홍규,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108082310

According to a popular estimate it has covered a span of five thousand years since the period of its first known civilization, that is Indus Valley Civilization. One feature that is most often noticed about India is its diversity and unity. Several different levels of social strains coexist in contemporary India, from primitive hunters and gathers to IT specialists. The Indian social system is often described as bounded and rigid. But there have been many exceptions. The broad divisions and sub-divisions, or castes and sub-castes in Indian society are complex and confusing. Most of the major religions of the world-Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism-are found here. Religious boundaries are more clearly drawn. The Hindus and the Muslims are the major religious communities in India. Culturally, however, the Hindus are not homogeneous, nor are the Muslims. Contemporary Indian society is undergoing a trauma of change and is confronting a series of dilemmas and paradoxes, in terms of castes and religions.",박정석,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76521936
