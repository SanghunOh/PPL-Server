As a result, this study proposes a new method which is based on the reference point method and perspective coordinate system. And the test measurement was operated to compare the measurement accuracy of the proposed method and the method based on reference grid screen method and perpendicular coordinate system which is commonly used at present. The result of this test measurement showed that the proposed method has higher accuracy.
Two reasons can be pointed out for the improvement of measuring accuracy. The first reason is that the proposed perspective coordinate system reduces the perspective distortion of photography. And second reason is that measuring points can be closely place to the scale and coordinate reference plan of measurement by the proposed reference point method which make possible to place measuring object(or person) at the center of scale and coordinate reference plan by utilizing reference points of measurement in the three dimensional space not on screen.",박찬미,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2092934
타자로서의 이주민,"There are many immigrants in HK society, but only the immigrants from Mainland China are called ""w Immigrants""which conveys negative implications. This phenomenon could be interpreted as discrimination towards newcomers in many societies, but in the case of HK, it should be looked at from the specific context of colonialism and relations with the Mainland. Throughout colonial history, the HK identity has been established on the grounds of denial towards Mainland China. The attitude of Hongkongers towards ""w Immigrants""s related to the politics of identity in HK.
This paper investigates how ""w Immigrants""rom Mainland China to HK are categorized as the 'Other' The complicated relationship of the status and identity between 'Hongkongers' and 'New Immigrants' shows the vulnerability of the distinction. The analyses on the discourses imposed on the New Immigrants and how they deviate from reality suggest that the HK identity is based on the politics of memory and oblivion. Immigrants are tamed and made into Hongkongers through various institutions and apparatuses. HK society is reproduced through this process, but at the same time, the continuous inflow of the immigrants from Mainland China violates the boundary of the distinctive Hongkonger identity. The reproduction process cannot be seamless with the existence of immigrants.",장정아,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30053115
사이버 매체와 현대의 대중 서사,"Literatures and other subordinate branches utilizing cyber media which have been full-fledged since the 1990s choose methods of actively projecting their writers' desires onto others via fantasizing. Cyber literatures depend on aspects in which their writers create a third space-time dimension in fantasies and realize their desires. By restructuring frames of the genres of the existing popular literatures and adding fantasy thereto via experiments or realization of political ideologies of individuals or figuration of romantic fabrication, which solves lack of self-confidence, cyber literatures have occupied positions contrasting to the existing literatures. Texts of cyber narratives literatures show forms of literatures and cultural identities ensuing from changes of media by modifying the existing genres such as fantasy novels, martial arts novels, romance novels. etc. by adjusting thereof to Korean situations. Subordinate main cultural bodies actively express their discontent with realities, and experience exotic space and time by entering into fantasies to overcome such discontent and to escape from the routines of dailiness. This is a method of fantasizing which intentionally shows being another person by forming a ground of literature space. For this, they specifically and actively try to reform the other persons by methods such as entry into other worlds, reincarnation, substituted history, realization of political ideas, administration of nations or feudal territories, virtual realities of games, central districts of martial arts, idealized academic spaces, etc. This trend of cyber narratives texts actively confronts other persons in the relationship with them more than any existing narratives texts, and re-perceives the realities and shows strong will of reforming routines comprising such realities. It is because rediscovery of cores of epics which end up with individual growth, elements of fantasizing involved in the process thereof and being the others composing the other side of realities, and re-perception of realities generate a more universalized paradigm by crossing the border between literature and culture.",나은진,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82345108
『열녀전』 의 보급과 전개,"This paper looks into the process of influx and acceptance of Yulnyojun(列女傳) from China, regarding Chosun dynasty’s Sushinsuh as one of genderapparatus to form a Confucian woman self. To study it, this paper not onlyinvestigates the acceptance, translation, and supply of Yulnyojun in Chosundynasty, but also its influence on individual woman in Yangban family in detail.
For the first, this work reveals characteristics of Yulnyojun, the collection ofbiographies of women before Han(漢) dynasty, and finds out its continuouscontribution to reproduce Confucian woman’s image. Then, the influx ofYulnyojun and its popularity through translation and supply of Sohak(小學) inKorea are discussed, with Yulnyojun’s situating process as an importantSushinsuh among Yangban women. It is proved that Chosun dynasty mainlyaccepted ideologies such as prenatal cares and the chastity from Yulnyojun,which actually includes various kinds of values of women. Patriarchal system inChosun used regulation on woman’s body such as prenatal care and chastity toshape Confucian woman’s character, and it was more stiffened in the laterChosun dynasty. The prenatal care is aimed to maintain the production of gooddescendents in patriarchal lineage, and the chastity is aimed to preserve purelineage of the patriarchal family. Therefore, emphasis on the prenatal care andthe chastity is to strengthen the family system based on patriarchy. Regulation on woman’s body became harsh along with the intensification of Confucianpatriarchal order in the later Chosun dynasty, and consequently, Yolnyo, whodies after one’s husband’s death, prevailed in the nation. In other words, Yolideology is such a gender apparatus to “indirectly lynch” numerous women,regulating their bodies in extreme ways. However, Yulnyojun still praised womenwho have practiced Yol ideology as the wholesome models of Confucian womanso that it contributed to reproduce more Yolnyo. We can find the clue ofYolnyojun’s this kind of aspect in Yu Hyang’s Yulnyojun. The reason thatwoman Sushinsuh such as Yulnyojun was so successfully accepted andreproduced is becauseYulnyojun is not only historical record as a biography, but also narrativeapparatus that can drive readers to identify themselves with a heroin through thereading process, and naturally let them assimilate to the ideology.",김경미,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75224333

포스트휴먼과 지능 담론(1) -인간의 뇌와 인공지능의 비교 담론을 중심으로-,"This paper is intended to synthesize the comparative discourse between the human brain and artificial intelligence. The discussion of the human brain is deeply related to studies on intelligence. And these studies are used as a basis for comparison between human intelligence and AI. Therefore, we looked at the points where the human brain and artificial intelligence are compared. First of all, we pointed out in the research of Yuval Noah Harari that the next generation of humans has not yet appeared, but that the discussion is being overly specific. Next, the physiological existence of the human brain and the purpose of developing artificial intelligence are different. The human brain is involved in modeling and controlling the entire human life. And in synthesizing past facts and predicting the future, brain inaccuracy works rather creatively. Finally, unlike our full understanding of the structure of computers and artificial intelligence, the mechanism by which the human brain works is still unknown. And the human brain intervenes in its interpretation to receive information from the sensory organs. Accordingly, the imperfection of human cognitive ability rather plays a decisive role in expanding human experience. The discourse of the human brain is connected to the discourses of human intelligence, as mentioned earlier.

학교 다문화교육 교재에 대한 교사 요구: 초등학교 및 중학교 교사 인터뷰를 중심으로,"This study aimed to explore the ideal teaching materials for effective multicultural education in elementary and middle school students in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. To achieve this, the study conducted written surveys and focus group interviews with 13 teachers divided into three groups based on developmental stage and school level. The collected data was analyzed using KJ method, which is a type of qualitative case analysis. The results showed the demands and current status of multicultural education text book, consisting of education goals, content, and teaching methods from the three groups. All three groups of teachers considered enhancing students’ multicultural competencies as the educational goal of the multicultural education text book. In terms of content and teaching methods, the demands differed by school level. For elementary school lower grades, the teachers wanted specific examples related to multicultural society and multicultural students in the content and preferred play-based teaching methods. For elementary school upper grades, the multicultural education text book was required to include specific activities such as using books, discussions, role-plays, and fostering communication between multicultural and non-multicultural students. It was also required that the content cover various topics. In addition, the teachers also requested the text book with high usability, grade-specific materials, lesson plans that can be immediately used, and internet-based materials. For middle school, the teachers wanted the text book that could enhance the linkage between subjects and include the latest issues in Korean society that students are interested in. They preferred student-led activities as a teaching method.

The study’s purpose is, firstly, examining the significance of the ‘expanded relationship’ concept presented through the 2014 Taipei Biennial since Bourriaud’s 1990s ‘relational aesthetics.’ Secondly, it aims to categorize artworks that explored the relationality between humans and non-humans by the three patterns of human - nature, human - new life-form, and human - machine based on Bourriaud’s ‘expanded relationship’ concept, and to analyze this to survey the aesthetic value.

"데이비드 호크니, 미적 표현의 혼용 - 60년대 후반 로스앤젤레스 시기의 작품을 중심으로 -","This thesis is significant in that it investigates the figuration and abstraction read in the works David Hockney(1937-) produced in Los Angeles in the late 1960s. During this period, he used people close to him as the main objects of his works. The figures in his paintings seem to follow the frame of traditional figurative paintings, although they are not the outcomes of a complete representation. As a way to materialize the expression of a person, he utilized photography as an auxiliary means of medium, which is reminiscent of representation and narrative, the characteristics of figurative painting. At the same time, Hockney employed abstraction which emerged as a relative concept of figuration in his way. He arranged his work like an image on the canvas, and filled the space in his painting by borrowing the works of abstract painting. This is an expression of flatness, an absolute attribute of purity which was emphasized by Clement Greenberg (1909-1994). In a modern sense, dividing the boundary between figuration and abstraction might be treated as an anachronistic dichotomous way of thinking. Nevertheless, it shall be regarded justifiable to analyze Hockney's independent method of absorbing figuration and abstraction in his own way, in view of the circumstances of the times in which he was active.",이지수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108075009
한류 콘텐츠를 활용한 외국인 학습자 대상 한국 고전문학 교육 방안: 드라마 <옷소매 붉은 끝동>을 중심으로,"This article aims to devise an effective way of educating foreign learners about Korean classical literature by incorporating Hallyu(Korean Wave) content. With the widespread influence of the Hallyu, the demand for Korean studies among foreign learners has rapidly increased. Additionally, the changes in the Korean educational environment have heightened educational authorities’ interest in promoting the spread of Korean studies and attracting foreign students. To foster the continuous development of Korean studies, it is essential to consider and explore educational methods and contents that are suitable for foreign learners. In particular, Korean classical literature is likely to be perceived as more unfamiliar and challenging for foreign learners. The interest and motivation of foreign learners must be actively considered to overcome these difficulties in classical literature education. John Dewey's theory provides a theoretical background for this. Based on his theory, Hallyu content should be deeply involved in the selection of learning topics or course design in the curriculum for foreign learners. To determine this, the study took into account the favorability of Hallyu content and the preference for learning material. Additionally, the selection criteria for educational video media and the suitability of the narrative were taken into consideration. The class process was mostly divided into five stages, and a specific plan was proposed for studying the classical novel “Unyeong-jeon” by connecting it to “The Red Sleeve”. Although this article only focused on a single work and did not confirm its applicability in the educational field, its significance lies in the fact that it suggested the direction of education and soughth concrete alternatives based on it.",주지영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660252
이인성의 동양화와 그 시대성,"Genius painter In-sung Lee(1912~1950) representing the modern times of the Republic of Korea is famous as a typical Western painter. But he was a talented painter who also drew various types of Oriental paintings including the four gentleman plants, hahuihua(Oriental painting portraiting flowers and grasses), Oriental landscape paintings, and portraits. There are currently 30 Oriental paintings and most of his landscape paintings were painted according to traditional composition and brush strokes while his paintings of the four gentleman plants, huahuehua and portraits are rather flat and completed with sensible brush strokes and Indian ink providing a feel of a “Western water painting drawn with Indian ink”. Such plasticity is proof that he focused more on the management of Indian ink and the visual image of the drawn objects instead of their mentality or ideology inherent in traditional Oriental paintings. They all have the common characteristics of being figures with clear body curves with slightly bowing heads, relatively emphasized shoulders, and slim waists. The paintings may be categorized into portraits of women carrying a water jar on their head or a baby and women enjoying entertainment under a willow.
Lee's Oriental paintings embody the multifaceted representations of Korean modern art. His Western paintings composed mostly of water and oil paintings are official visual objects intentionally painted to make a living and maintain his status and fame by submitting them to exhibitions. On the other hand, his Oriental paintings completed with writing brushes and ink sticks are privately owned paintings freely “drawn” based on his talent and natural experiences in his surroundings without being conscious of a specific purpose or audience. That is, if Lee's Western paintings were produced under strict planning and are “norms” expressing the trends of the times, Oriental paintings are vernacular modernism naturally expressing the tradition and customs he learned during his growth and that of his mental world. For his Oriental paintings, Lee selected traditional and earthy materials as his subjects and endowed them with classical images to naturally express the vernacular identity of modern Korea.",송희경,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60162977

The point of this article is threefold. First, whether an accusation that the “Confucian patriarchal system” is a hotbed of family contradictions, social conflicts and pathological phenomena occurring in modern Korean society is justified. Second, whether traditional and coloniality still exists in modern family concepts and discourse.

Inclusive immigration policy takes the basic direction of policy to find a direction for community development and reflect it in policy through mutual interchange between different groups, such as migrant groups and native groups.

But, this thesis doesn’t make a conclusion negatively, related with developing the conception of imitation, lack of consistency, but takes notice of stratum structure of real existence, that is, existence theoretical structure which urges to transfer to the stage related with real existence from image or imitation. nobody can pass over that, though unclear and suggestive, image or imitation has a meaning as a negative, but essential process for the access to real eX1stence. The metaphysical examination, centering on the relationship with imitation and its prototype, real existence, presents clearly existence theoretical background and ideological view of arts that Plato considered that the aim of arts is concrete presentation on absolute real existence. 1n addition, the core of the analysis implicates real existence foundation on image. His theory of imitation arts can be defined as the metaphysics, and it is closely related with the frame, stratum of existence that is, stratum structure of existence intemally. The questions, ""how many prototypes appear in copy and imitation? How beauty appears from beautiful things?"" suggest Plato’s general philosophy such as existence and generation, respective things and Eidos, image and substance, the one and the many, and usual affairs under the frame of stratum structure of existence So, basic understanding on imitation aπS 1S understanding on the ways how existing conditions are related with and communicate with real existence.
Plato expects the transformation into imitation skills of describing image faithfully and ideological imitation skills on the basis of proper relationship of dependence with real existence, recovering phantasm or monotonous realistic imitation skills by artists as concrete ways to caπY out ascending transformation to real existence. He accepts imitation skills creating image of real existence as a trustworthy and beautiful imitation by pursuing and looking after order and beauty of symmetry, where artistic works appear from the models. Considering the facts, this thesis views that interpretation of Plato’s imitation as a low class copy of simple appearance is an distortion of his true arts. He lays an emphasis of weakness of aπs and limitation of imitation image, but thought that the ideology of true artist is to recognize lack of copy, but to understand the substance of aesthetic objects at the back of existing condition.",손청문,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104982542
영화 <미나리>에 재현된 이주민의 적응과 생존의 삶,"The narrative of a film is a fictional world that was created. However, given that a world represented by a film is an imitation of reality, this fictionality of the film becomes a real event that contains an aspect of our life. The reflection of our reality in worlds represented by various cultural contents including the film is probably pursued so that we may experience indirectly and understand events arising from the various ways of life we lead.The film Minari represents the process of immigration and settlement of a South Korean immigrant’s (Jacob) family in the United States during the 1980s. And the process of immigration and settlement experienced by the family is boiled down to adaptation to a new environment and survival. At the present time when the whole world coexists, being mixed up into one, the immigrant life of adaptation and settlement can have some implication for us. In this context, this paper looks into some aspects of the immigrants’ identity represented in the film Minari, that is, adaptation to a new environment and survival.This paper looks at the narratives of the immigrant family’s adaptation and survival, through their conflicts, living space, and symbolic subject matters embodied in the film Minari. In the development of its narratives, the film Minari does not bring to the forefront cultural conflict and clash resulting from immigration. Rather, it relates that true adaptation, settlement and survival should be accompanied by familial love. The wheeled house denotes a space of unstable life, and the incineration of male chicks is construed as revealing that what they want is settlement and survival. It may safely be said that the minari planted by Soon-ja is a subject matter symbolizing a desire to take root in barren soil and represents immigrants’ life of adaptation and survival.",진수현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660253
