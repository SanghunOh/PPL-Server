In addition, structural equation analysis was conducted using AMOS 18.0 to achieve the research purpose. As a result, it was found that among the factors of resort ESG management activities, governance factors had a significant effect on the corporate image. However, it was found that environmental and social factors did not significantly affect the corporate image. In addition, the corporate image was also found to have a significant effect on the intention to pay additional payments.
It was found that all factors of resort ESG management activities had a significant effect on the intention to pay additionally. Through the research results, the following academic and practical implications are provided. The academic implication is that ESG's research area has been expanded with research on how it affects consumers based on consumer perceptions of corporate ESG activities In particular, the elements of ESG management activities for the resort industry were identified at a time when the tourism industry was not covered in the international discussion process on ESG management. It can also be meaningful that it attempted to study the impact of ESG activities on corporate image and additional payment intention.",전정아,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107839780

농촌관광에 대한 지역주민 지지도에 영향을 미치는 요인,"This study investigates and analyzes the perception of rural tourism among local residents living in ‘rural experience villages’ of Korea. The purpose is to provide implications for the providers of rural tourism products. As a research method, first of all, the literature reviewed local residents' attitudes to rural tourism and tourism impacts and related prior studies. Through this process, the major influential factors of the rural tourism by the local residents were derived, and then the opinions of the rural residents of the local farm village were collected and analyzed statistically through the sample survey. In order to successfully implement the rural experience village development project, local residents need to actively participate in decision-making. Local residents should actively participate in the early stages of the project so that they can have psychological ownership. Furthermore, the extent of involvement in rural tourism development requires participation in the whole process of policy making, policy enforcement and policy evaluation. In addition to the decision-making process, participation must be made in the implementation and operation of the development, benefits, evaluation and feedback as well. In conclusion, the development method of rural tourism should be in the form of tourism development centered on local community and of local participation type. Therefore, rural tourism development must be applied differently from traditional tourism development, based on the principle of sustainable tourism development.",임형택,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108573985

관광업계 종사자들의 공정관광 실현 제약 경험에 대한 정성적 연구: 공정성 이론을 중심으로,"Since the need was identified roughly ten years ago, domestic tourism policies have been implemented from a variety of perspectives, and tangible results have been achieved. As unfair tourism practices in the tourism industry continue to exist in a chronic form, the purpose of this study is to identify the obstacles tourism industry employees face in realizing fair tourism. Participants from the tourism industry in Seoul were recruited and analyzed using qualitative research methods. FGI was conducted for a total of 15 workers in the travel, social enterprise, and accommodation industries between July and August of 2021, and they were categorized into six fairness categories. Specifically, the fairness of procedures, interaction, opportunity, perception, business environment, and distribution process were classified. As the first study in the tourism context, this study theoretically contributed to the expansion of fairness theory and originality in the research subjects by reflecting the voices of tourism field industry workers and analyzing their limitations on the realization of fair tourism. In addition, policy implications that can be implemented in practice are proposed in order for fair tourism to take root in our society in the post-COVID-19 era.",이경여,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107839777
관광자에 대한 지역주민의 정서적 연대가 관광개발 지지에 미치는 영향: 홍대 인근 지역을 중심으로,"As domestic tourism gains prominence today, local tourism is also undergoing change. When a community is established as a tourist destination, its members diversify, resulting in a variety of situations. Before becoming tourist destinations, communities are inhabited by the local populace. This study aims to determine the effect of emotional solidarity between locals and tourists on tourism development support. It was conducted from January 7 to February 28, 2022 via an online/offline survey of 302 Hongdae-area residents, and the following are the results of the analysis. According to the research hypothesis, emotional solidarity had a significant effect on perceived benefits, perceived costs, and community attachment, and perceived benefits, perceived costs, and community attachment had both positive (+) and negative (-) effects on government trust. Third, perceived benefits and perceived costs had a positive (+) effect on supporting tourism development, but the research hypothesis was not supported because of the negative (-) effect of community attachment. Finally, it was discovered that government trust and emotional solidarity have a positive impact on supporting tourism development, and that the theoretical and practical implications derived from this study can be used as a foundation for tourism development in the Hongdae region.",이재현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108462557
한식의 맛과 향을 세계에 알릴수 있는 방법론적 연구,"In 1998 the Korean National Tourism Organization published a book called""Foreign Language Notation of Korean Food Names in Korean Restaurants(English, Japanese, Chinese)"", which is very desirable for Korea since Korea is the host country of 2002 World Cup Games. This study is to analyze the characteristics of 105 kinds of Korean Foods listed in the book stated above and their differences from Chinese foods through the cultural comparison of the names of Korean foods and their translations into Chinese.

인간 동물학 관점으로 본 반려동물 동반 관광 및 호텔 경험 탐구: 한국-영국 비교 분석,"This study aims to comprehensively explore and compare pet-inclusive tourism and hotel experiences in South Korea and the United Kingdom from an anthrozoological perspective. The detailed objectives are as follows. First, it examines and contrasts the perception of pets as family members in both societies. Second, the study conducts comparative analyses of preparations for and experiences during pet-accompanied travel and hotel stays, investigating how these differences manifest. Third, it explores the influence of each culture's socio-cultural and institutional frameworks on pet-inclusive tourism and accommodations. The study employs a micro-ethnographic-based qualitative methodology, combining observational techniques with individual in-depth interviews. Pet-friendly hotels, restaurants, and museums in Gangneung, South Korea, and Cornwall, UK, were chosen for observation. After this, individual in-depth interviews were individually conducted with 22 adults who have pets and have experienced domestic travel involving overnight stays. The data, which was analyzed using thematic analysis, revealed four themes: ‘pets’ roles as family members’, ‘travel focus: pets vs. owners’, ‘determinants of travel satisfaction: pets vs. owners’, and ‘diverse attitudes towards pet-related policies.’ A key finding is that in South Korea, ensuring the comfort and pleasure of pets constitutes the primary objective of travel, which frequently leads to the selection of pet-friendly destinations and accommodations. Conversely, in the UK, travel plans predominantly revolve around the preferences and interests of the pet owners. These variations are shaped by each country's cultural backdrop, values, and policies and regulations concerning pets. The results of this study provide substantial foundational data for enhancing pet-accompanied travel services from a global perspective, illustrating its potential to augment satisfaction in pet-inclusive travel and foster growth in related industries.",최미주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107019583
