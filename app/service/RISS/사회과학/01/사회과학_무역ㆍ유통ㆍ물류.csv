"세계화, 성장, 불평등과 빈곤에 대한 고찰","This paper examines globalization, economic growth, inequality and poverty through literature research. The advocate of globalization argues that advances in globalization lead to high economic growth and a reduction in inequality and poverty in developing countries. However, an analysis of empirical experiences has confirmed that the claim that catch-up growth is possible is practically difficult to realize in developing countries. In addition, the analysis of global income and consumption inequality and poverty trends related to the progress of globalization showed that overall income and consumption inequality has increased since the 1980s, with 900 million people, or 12.8% of the world s population, living below the $1.9 poverty line per day as of 2012. With the fruits of growth concentrated on the financial sector and the top class, it is necessary for developing countries to provide adequately opportunities and incentives while presenting systematic policies suitable for sustainable growth and to expand opportunities for the poor to participate in growth beyond the financial means for redistribution of income rather than simply accepting prescriptions from the standpoint of advocating globalization.",윤성종(Sungjong Yun),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107152394

미중 무역전쟁과 게임이론: 협상력 비대칭 상황에서의 협조적 균형 가능성,"This study applies diverse game theories to the US-China Trade War. The US-China Trade War can be analyzed as a game situation because the strategic decision-making process to maximize one’s profit while considering the reaction of the other party is a game situation.
However, related research suffered from some mistakes in applying the US-China Trade War as it is to classic game theory, because while the prisoners dilemma is based on the situation of No Communication, No Trust, No Cooperation, the US-China Trade War has a precondition different from that of prisoners dilemma, since it mutually communicates information and negotiation is repeated several times in a cooperative situation. The result of the trade negotiation will likely end as ""cooperate-cooperate"".
Further, considering trade volume, trade interdependence, bargaining power based on economy, and the scale of damage caused by the Trade War, the US-China Trade War is progressing with the bargaining power of the US being higher than that of China. Since the current US-China Trade War is in an asymmetrical situation under the dominant bargaining power of the US, it is likely to reach ‘US defect-China cooperative’ in the long run.",김홍률(Hong-Youl Kim),2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104841626

And It is becoming more important for the marketers and designers to understand its trends and analysize market and the consumer needs correctlly.
In 1990s, the yearly income of consumers has increased, and the female became one of the most powerful consumer groups in the society. But the emerging power of new generations which are called generation X or Xers is the most characteristic image of 1990s.
Xers are from late teens to the carly tweenties and they have their specific and pecular consumer behavior. They are usually compared to the Baby Boomers generation, the former generation of Xers and the great bubble of affluent individuals born between 1946 to 1964. Boomers are ideological, but the Xers are materialistic and individualistic.
As the Xers came of age in a world, the ""We Products' which Boomer preferred has changed into the 'Me Products' which show the individualistic behavior of Xers consumer.
The value of design and the style of products became more important purchasing factor to the Xers than the Boomers. The Beauty Industry, which are Cosmetics, Diet, and Fitness nowadays got into the market and growing fast to satisfy the Xers' needs for beauty.
From 1988 the Western style Fast Food became popular to the Xers and the teenagers Obsity became a social issue.

비즈니스 모델 혁신을 통한 후발기업 전략에 관한 연구: 아이팟과 스포티파이 사례를 중심으로,"While existing studies on late-mover strategy dealt with the situation in which first-movers and late-movers compete in similar business models, this paper examines the late-mover strategy from the perspective of business model innovation. Business model innovation is a fundamentally different phenomenon from a product innovation as well as a technology innovation: These innovations arise in different ways and have different targets of innovation.
Business model innovation is the introduction of a new business model or the discovery of a fundamentally different business model in an existing business. A late-mover can effectively neutralize the competitive advantage of a first-mover through business model innovation. Apple, a late-mover, was able to dominate the digital music market by incorporating an iTunes Store that offered digital music songs that could be purchased and downloaded through its platform with its MP3 player iPod in 2003. As such, the key success factor of the iPod was business model innovation, not product innovation. Spotify, which was a late-mover than Apple, surpassed the MP3 download-based iPod business model through streaming-based and freemium business model innovation. In particular, Spotify has revolutionized every component of its business model, from value proposition to value capture, and has overtaken Apple to dominate the digital music market. If a late-mover changes the rule of competition through business model innovation, a first-mover may fall into a difficult situation. From this point of view, business model innovation offers managers a new way for late-movers to attack first-movers",이동현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107192138

"중국 화장품 시장에서 원산지, 제품, 인플루언서 특성이 구매의도에 미치는 영향분석","With the spread of using the Internet and mobile phones, social exchanges have become more active via social network service(SNS) including Facebook and Instagram. As a result, a new player called influencer has become important. Influencers introduce or recommend specific products via SNS accounts. As the result, they may affect behaviors of consumers on the Internet. This study aims at investigating the impacts of influencer, national and product characteristics on purchase intention in the Chinese cosmetics market. We collected data from Chinese consumers who are familiar with influencers. The data was analyzed by SEM(Structural Equation Modeling). According to empirical findings, reliable and interactive aspects of influencers play an important role to increase purchase intention of Chinese consumers. In addition, cultural and technological features of origin country are positively associated with consumer intention to buy cosmetics. We investigate moderating effects of influencers on relationships between product / country characteristics and purchase intention. Based on the results of SEM, the relationship between cultural level of origin country and purchase intention is positively moderated by influencers. The findings may have important implications for enterprisers and policy makers. Using reliable and interactive influencers can be critical for individual companies to penetrate into local markets. Also, governments should endeavor to improve own technological and cultural images. Positive images of a country can contribute competitiveness of products from the country. Limitations and suggestions for future research are also discussed.","진청운(CHEN, Qing-Yun)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106304771

저출산 고령화로 인한 인구절벽의 경제적 영향 및 대응방안에 관한 연구: 해외 주요사례를 중심으로,"Korea is one of the countries where the ‘demographic cliff’ is becoming a reality at the fastest rate. While economic growth has benefited from the ‘demographic bonus’, the likelihood of growth slowdown is increasing due to the ‘demographic onus’. However, an insufficient number of accurate diagnoses and countermeasures has been prepared. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze cases of foreign countries that have experienced a demographic cliff before Korea to apply the findings to the case of Korea. From the analysis, it was found that these countries showed a decrease in labor force and, as a result, a decrease in consumption demand. Positive effects such as securing labor force and increasing consumption demand resulted from efforts to solve these problems, such as birth encouragement policies, employment of female workers, expansion of jobs for the elderly and policies on influx of immigrants. As such, Korea also needs to refer to these policies and cases for a shift in birth encouragement measures toward realistic goals to overcome the ultra-low birthrate. To this end, gender-equal family policies, work-family balance and indiscriminate acceptance of various family types are required. In addition, supporting policies to create a virtuous cycle of an influx of elite immigrants, utilization of the elderly labor force, and support for economic independence of the youth are necessary in order to secure a labor force.",박준우,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107318911
