If you don't actually rent, a property with a lease deposit, the tenant will not receive the deposit back and will have difficulty finding a place to live. Such real estate Lease fraud is recognized as a social problem, due to the problem of damaging the stability of the real estate market and infringing on the rights, and interests of tenants. Real estate Lease fraud is emerging as a social problem that undermines the, stability of the real estate market and violates the rights and interests of tenants. To solve this problem, institutional improvement is needed to prevent, real estate Lease fraud. In this paper, we would like to present institutional improvement measures to, solve these problems through the analysis of the concept and type of real estate Lease fraud and the causes, of real estate Lease fraud. In addition, through overseas case analysis, we would like, to investigate the operation and effectiveness of the real estate Lease fraud prevention system to find, ways applicable to Korea. To this end, the introduction will briefly explain the research background, research purpose, and research method, and then deal with, the concept and type of real estate lease, fraud, cause analysis, and overseas case analysis.",김진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108558859
주택 전세사고 예방을 위한 법·제도 개선방안 연구,"Recently, more and more tenants with lease contracts are not able to get their deposit back, making it a social problem. This study is a study on the improvement of laws and systems to prevent damage that cannot be returned by such housing tenants. First, a lease contract is signed for real estate for residential purposes, including so-called ""rental fraud"", and any case in which the return of part or all of the deposit is delayed or not received at the time the contract is terminated is defined as a ""rental accident"".
In order to prevent such a lease accident, the tenant's attention is essential, but if you look at the measures to improve the law and system excluding this, it can be summarized as follows. First, it is necessary to increase the absolute sentence for ""rental fraud"" that intentionally defrauds the tenant's deposit. It is necessary to set the sentence based on the victim's unrecovered damage. Next, if there is a senior restriction right, it is necessary to lower the guarantee limit of the lease deposit return guarantee to 90% rather than 100% in order to list the scope of the small tenant's preferential repayment in the contract and confirmation manual.
In particular, in the case of trust real estate, in order to prevent lease accidents caused by not checking the trust register, it is necessary to prevent damage to tenants by making it mandatory to check the trust register and confirm the parties to the lease contract.",서영천,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636087
지방소멸방지를 위한 특별자치도의 정책방안 연구,"The decrease in local population breaks the balance with the economic development of the region, fails to realize decentralization and balanced development, and eventually approaches the crisis of local extinction. The main causes of the population decline in the provinces were the natural decrease due to the low fertility rate and population aging, and the larger factor, the social decrease (population outflow). In the Special Self-Governing Province, it is necessary to break away from the policy practice of the central government and actively prepare policy measures to respond to local extinction by using its own special authority and position. Since the policy establishment of the central government related to the population decline crisis, such as the 「Basic Act on Low Fertility and Aging Society」 in 2006, was promoted in a uniform way, there are many problems that do not properly reflect the characteristics of each local government and the situation at the site.

The results based on radio-tracking of two subadult Asian badgers(one female, one male) and camera trapping can be summarized as follows. First, home range size of badger were 1.24㎢(Female), 1.23㎢(Male) during August to November. Seconds, badger hibernation continued from mid December to mid April. During the winter hibernation period, badger frequently came in and out of hibernation sett(36 days, 211 times). Thirds, seven individual badgers used the same sett during the hibernation, while they had solitary foraging activities outside. Fourth, badgers did not spend the winters in the same sett, although they seldom changed sett during hibernation. Badger appeared frequently territory marking on ridge trails from May to June. Meanwhile, they decrease use of the ridge trails from July when food resources are abundant. The sett use and home-range, inferred from radio tracking and camera trapping, will provide valuable basic information required for conserving and managing Asian badger.",최태영,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636085
부동산의 수요·공급 이론과 가격형성에 관한 이론적 접근,"1. CONTENTS (1) RESEARCH OBJECTIVES It is the research objective to see through the theory of supply and demand for the mutual relation between supply and demand in the real estate and also to see through how the prices of the real estate can be formed or influenced owing to a kind of primary factor. (2) RESEARCH METHOD It is the method to see through the primary factor of price formation as well as the theory of fixing the real estate prices for the price formation of the real estate through the theory of supply and demand in the real estate. (3) RESEARCH FINDINGS It is just like the difficult homework to make a solution of problem after constantly thinking of the real estate. It is after all a work of a constantly research finding. On the one hand, the supply of the real estate is realistically limited in a narrow land like our country. On the other hand, the demand of the real estate is continuously on the increase. The demand that is saying here is necessary for dwelling to some degree, but it includes the investment objective, pride of individual ownership and a tax problem. The prices of the real estate in the end are formed by the conditions of supply and demand as well as the surroundings of the real estate. 2. RESULTS The primary factor of price formation has a characteristic of fluidity and a characteristic of relation. The primary factor of price formation, therefore, is continuously changing according to the fluctuation in the existing circumstances accomplishing the primary factor. And the primary factors of price formation in the real estate do not act on the price formation independently one by one, but they have an organic correlation one another. The primary factors of price formation fall into two main groups: one group is a general primary factor of being an external one which has an influence on the activity and the price of the real estate, and the other group is an individual primary factor of being an external one which has an influence on the individualized price of the real estate and its concretization according to the individual characteristic of the real estate.","유원상(You, Won Sang)",2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75012788

국내 전국 시·군과 도시 인구규모별 녹지 접근성 평가- 보행특성 기반의 네트워크 분석의 적용 -,"Because domestic demand for green spaces continues to increase, it is important to design pedestrian environments that allow easy access to green space services for any citizen. Due to the continuous urbanization, however, the reduction of green space areas and insufficient pedestrian infrastructure are still significant challenges for providing green space services. In addition, there is an issue with regard to fairness towards citizens who have difficulty walking long distances to green spaces, such as the elderly and the disabled. In this regard, this study identified areas where green space services are not adequately supplied by evaluating the accessibility of green spaces considering green space area, slope-weighted distance, population, and pedestrian characteristics in all cities and counties nationwide in South Korea. In addition, we analyzed the causes of weakened green space accessibility. As a result, it was found that the larger the population of the city, the lower the average green space area and the greater the walking distance from residential areas to green spaces, and the area of green space accessibility-vulnerable areas also tended to increase. For long-distance pedestrian access to green spaces in the neighborhood, the areas with the largest green space accessibility-vulnerable areas were Incheon-si, Iksan-si, and Muan-gun, which correspond to large, medium, and small cities by population size, respectively. For short-distance pedestrian access, Seoul-si, Iksan-si, and Nonsan-si, which correspond to large, medium, and small cities by population size, respectively, had the largest green space accessibility-vulnerable areas. Through this study, green space accessibility-vulnerable areas were identified based on short and long walking distances, and the major causes of weakened green space accessibility by urban population size were identified. These results are expected to contribute to the establishment of not only green space expansion plans, but also pedestrian environment improvement plans according to the characteristics of each city.",고찬우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108295416
소규모주택정비사업의 문제점과 개선방안: 대구광역시를 중심으로,"The purpose of this study is to examine issues related to the small-scale housing improvement project and to discover improvements. A major problem is that the main participants such as unions lack driving capacities like business promotion conditions, expertise and so on. Second, the project is economically infeasible because of high taxes, miscellaneous charges, and high cost of construction. Third, there are fears of a potential mismatch with the surrounding environment.
Furthermore, there are concerns that there could be vacancies or unsold houses due to low social preference. Lastly, the related ordinance, which is a special law, is inadequate in terms of business implementation or promotion and support. One of the improvement plans is to increase the expertise of principle participants and to establish and distribute standard conventions. The second is the profitability provision. In particular, it is necessary to introduce a verification system for construction cost reasonableness and seek expense savings through joint bids for construction work. Also, concerning the construction charges or taxes for small-scale housing projects, the government should give an equal or higher level of grants compared to similar businesses. Third, businesses pursuing harmony with the surrounding environment should be encouraged to strengthen the connection between related plans. Fourth, it is necessary to enhance the preference of neighborhood environment and differentiate each housing estate from others simultaneously. Fifth, related laws concerning the Small-scale Reconstruction Project, such as giving union member the status of grantee after the approval of the union establishment and claim for sale to local landowners, should be reorganized. Lastly, public support should be expanded to support initial project expense such as the establishment of a union.",김종수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106036225
거시경제변수와 종합부동산세가 아파트 매매가격에 미치는 영향 연구,"This study investigates the relationship between macroeconomic variables and the comprehensive real estate tax on apartment sales prices in Seoul. The results of the analysis show that the continuation of low interest rates since the 2000s has had a positive effect on the apartment sales prices due to an increase in the money supply in the market. Additionally, the increase in apartment sales transaction volume is acting as a direct cause of driving the apartment sales price. Moreover, the increase in the comprehensive real estate tax is included in the apartment sales price, indicating that the government's regulatory policy can have an adverse effect. However, in a stable economic situation, empirical analysis has shown that the influence of macroeconomic variables such as the consumer price index and interest rates is insignificant. Therefore, the main reason for the additional apartment sales price is the increase in transaction volume. In light of these findings, a sharp increase in the comprehensive real estate tax, which is a holding tax, requires a cautious approach as it can exacerbate the transaction cliff that can occur in the future when the real estate market declines and lead to the government's distrust. As comprehensive real estate tax data for 2022 was not available for this study, during which there were rapid interest rate fluctuations, it was not possible to derive analysis results for the current situation. Additional data analysis is therefore needed to inform policy proposals.",이석원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107850899
한국 지적제도의 정체성 연구,"The purpose of this study is to get to the bottom of the current management system of the cadastral system in Korea by classifying into the related legal, administrative and research institute, presenting a right plan to establish the identity of the cadastral system in Korea based on its investigation and analysis. To this end, the temporal validity was made from the year 1910, when the land survey act was established, to the present time; the space was limited to Korea; and the survey method was adopted for literature search methodology and internet survey method. As a result, it was found that the law concerning the management of the Korean cadastral system was changed from the past ""Cadastral Law"" to the ""Act on the Establishment and Management of Spatial Information"" and that the name of the central government department handling the cadastral administration was changed from Cadastral Planning Division to Spatial Information System Division. Especially, as organizations surveying the present condition of the parcel, Korea Land and Geospatial Informatix Corporation surveys the physical status; the registry office handles the status of the rights; the competent cadastral office handles each official land value; and Urban Policy Division of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MLIT) handles the present condition of the use and regulations.
After all, the right plan for establishing the identify of the cadastral system in Korea should be covered as follows: First, the so-called ""Cadastral Management Act"" should be established by incorporating the related cadastral laws out of 'Establishment and Management Act of the Spacial Information', 'Real Estate Registration Act', 'Public Announcement Act of the Real Estate Value' and 'The National Land Planning and Utilization Act'. Second, Cadastral Management Division should be established under Land Policy Agency of MLIT. Third, the Land Management Office, a special government authority, should be established to cover the cadastral and registration services, land value estimation, and utilization and regulations. Fourth, the current cadastral resurvey system should totally be reorganized and it should be performed throughout the country at the same time and within short period. Fifth, Korea Land and Geospatial Informatix Corporation should be reorganized as a general authority to survey such total information as physical and rightful conditions including its value, utilization and regulations.",강한빛,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636084
금리변동이 주택가격에 미치는 구조적 영향 분석,"This study investigates the influence of interest rate fluctuations on various metrics associated with the real estate market in Korea, including apartment sales price, Jeonse (lump-sum deposit rental) price, gap price (difference between sales and Jeonse prices), Jeonse price ratio, and gap price ratio. These variables were analyzed nationwide, in Seoul, and in six major metropolitan cities using a Vector Autoregression Model. The findings suggest that sales prices, Jeonse prices, and Jeonse price ratios negatively correlate with interest rate fluctuations. Conversely, gap prices and gap price ratios in the six major metropolitan cities demonstrate a positive correlation with nationwide interest rate alterations.The impulse response of sales prices was most pronounced in Seoul, followed by the six major metropolitan cities, and then on a nationwide scale. Notably, the Jeonse price exhibited a shock response nearly four times that of the sales price. Locally, both Seoul and the six major metropolitan cities showed a more substantial response than observed nationwide.Importantly, the significant changes in Jeonse prices in the early stages, as confirmed by the impulse response results of the Jeonse price ratio, suggest that sudden shifts in Jeonse prices can have a considerable impact on households over a short period. Consequently, this study underscores the need for policy efforts addressing changes in Jeonse prices, which are as crucial as those related to sales price changes in the context of interest rate modifications. Furthermore, there is a need for further attention and research concerning the gap price and gap price ratio.",김양수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108186691

Each participant in the process recognizes the risk and tries to manage it. Risk that is not avoided pursues revenue in return. In the process, participants make reasonable decisions. In the existing real estate PF, there was a limit to construction companies that could participate because the role of construction companies was finite, but as the PF market recently expanded, trust companies' responsible land trusts expanded, construction companies with poor credit ratings could also participate in real estate PF. In addition, it is necessary to recognize risks and make decisions from each perspective, not to reduce dependence on construction companies.
In this paper, the decision making factors of PF loan participants for trust companies responsible for land trusts used for small and medium-sized development projects are analyzed, variables that affect each participant are identified, and the results are used to confirm the decision making differentiation.

STO를 이용한 부동산간접투자 활성화 방안,"The objective of this study is to propose strategies for promoting indirect property investment using Security Token Offerings (STOs) in association with the introduction of the STO system in Korea. Since property tokenization can convert the value of real estate into a token stored on a blockchain, digital ownership and transaction become possible. In order to achieve this objective, we have examined cases from Singapore and Japan where the STO system has already been introduced and implemented. Based on our findings, we propose the following strategies; First, we recommend using the verified Singapore’s ADDX platform rather than hastily developing a domestic platform under the circumstance where STO market has just been started in Korea. In the mean time the government should actively support the development of innovative platforms on which we can build our ‘Proof of Concept(PoC)’. Second, keeping in mind that the underlying asset of STO is real estate, token issuers must have property management capabilities. To this end, it is necessary to revise the regulatory system allowing STO to collaborate with competent real estate companies which can buy, operate, and sell real estate. In order to protect investors in the early stage of implementation, not only public offering but also private placement should be considered. Finally, since real estate has specific characteristics that make it different from other assets, such as stocks or bonds, the STO system should take these characteristics into account when creating new investment opportunities in the real estate market. In addition, building strong networks with government agencies, appraisal companies, and account management institutions can help STO issuers establish credibility, comply with regulations, and provide valuable services to investors. This can ultimately lead to greater investor confidence and a more successful STO.",허윤경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82511948

부동산 공시가격현실화정책의 재정립과 향후과제,"The original function of the officially announced price of real estate is “Indicators of Transactions and Evaluation and Taxation Standards”. However, it is also an important factor that performs ancillary functions as a means of real estate policy such as restraining real estate speculation. The government is pushing for real estate announced price realization as a means of informing real estate policy.The plan for realization of the announced price is based on the goal of realization rate of 90%, the differential increase between the announced prices and the progressive realization direction by dividing the high and low-priced houses.
Such plan to realize the announced price is causing side effects such as a distortion of equity due to excessive announcement price increase and accumulation of unfair practices between the announced prices under the conditions of soaring house prices. In addition, according to the plan to realize the announced price, the proper price in the real estate disclosure law reflects the market price, but it is inconsistent to establish the “public price”, which is the appropriate price reflecting the market price. Therefore, the improvement plan for Realization plan for the officially announced price of real estate is presented as follows.
First, the direction of the realization plan for the officially announced price has caused the burden to surge. After the transition to the policy of “equalization and temporary realization”, the level of burden by policy agreement should be set and rational tax rate adjustments should be concurrently performed. In order to equalize the official price, it is necessary to reorganize the disclosure cycle that discloses the officially announced price every three years.
Second, the standard price system should be introduced to promote the realization of the announced price in order to be transparent. Also, the improvement of related system such as real estate disclosure law should be promoted in parallel to improve the eligibility of the official price, which is the main element of the realization of the official price.
Third, if the level of an officially announced price is equalized and the goal is realized at a certain level, then the property tax rate system, the standard of assessment criteria, the comprehensive real estate tax rate system, and the system related to the official price should be revised at the same time.",전동흔,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108564876

But China employs every means possible to make it their own territory taking up the territory projects including the China's Northeast Asian Project distorting the facts that Gando is South Korea's territory. This is the ulterior motive to make it their territory by distorting the history and culture rather than arguing right or wrong on the meaninglessly convention. We need to take action about it because we know the ulterior motive of China. To do this, it is really important to reveal the fact who is the original owner of culture scattered in Gando. As cultural sovereignty is also one of the factors that determine the territorial sovereignty, real owner of the land is a people who enjoy the culture inhabited in its territory. This paper says that master of Gando culture is ours who are the owner of a northern culture leading from old Chosen dynasty. Because our nation settles the culture in Gando since the release of modern Bonggeum area as well as ancient. In addition to knowing that we are the owner of Gando culture, the researcher proposes a methodology to respond to the China that often distorts the cultural truth.

In particular, it was examined through a comparison between the group in which the real estate, which is an operating property, was successfully sold and the group that was not.
Previous previous studies focused on the correlation between major economic indicators and the return of real estate funds for the entire duration of real estate funds. However, this study is meaningful in that it attempted to analyze the rate of change in major economic indicators during the actual sale period.
As a result of the analysis, it was significantly confirmed that the successful sale of private equity funds was a negative relationship with the level of corporate bond issuance rates, and a negative relationship with the increase in the industrial production index and the bank loan delinquency rate. On the other hand, the housing sales index in Seoul was limited, but it was confirmed that it was a positive relationship.

계약갱신청구권과 전월세상한제: 문제점 및 근원적 해결 방안,"This article examines the practical aspects and problems in the rental market due to the right to request contract renewal and the jeonse and monthly rent limit system, and suggests fundamental resolutions. Although the right to request contract renewal and the jeonse and monthly rent limit system are seemingly policies to protect the tenant, the systems caused the side effects and abnormal price phenomenon because the systems were implemented without sufficient research on the rental and housing markets. As a result, the systems had negative impacts on both the tenant and the landlord, and drove the existing win-win relationship between the landlord and the tenant into a confrontational one. The implementation of the right to request contract renewal and the jeonse and monthly rent limit system is the result of ignoring the spirit of private autonomy, which is the basis of all life in Korea, and it seems to have originated from the view that the landlord and tenant are beings without autonomous capabilities, and beings that must be taken care of by state institutions. Therefore, recovering the spirit of private autonomy is in line with the spirit of the Constitution and the principle of civil law and seems to be the key to resolving the problems in the rental market. It is expected that the autonomy would be restored, and thus problems would be adjusted in the rental market through self-regulation by completely abolishing the right to request contract renewal and the jeonse and monthly rent limit system.",노현숙,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108568119
자녀 양육 가구의 교육열 및 여가 여행행태의 지역별 차이 분석,"This study classified households by life cycle and analyzed their leisure travel characteristics. We decided that the cause for the difference in leisure travel rates according to life cycle is related to children’s education. There is a regional difference in education fever, which affects leisure travel frequency. Three analyses were conducted to test this hypothesis. This study reveals the following. First, there is a significant difference in leisure travel frequency according to gender and whether there are children. Women’s leisure travel frequency is higher than that of men, and households with children have lower leisure travel frequency than households without children. Second, there is a significant difference in education fever according to region. The education fever index of each region was classified into three types. Education fever is highest in Seoul, the capital of Korea, followed by large metropolitan areas and the provinces. Third, regions with high education fever have greater decreases in leisure traffic when there are children in comparison with regions with low education fever. This study revealed that differences in educational zeal affect leisure travel in households with children, and through this, it was proved that educational zeal is an influencing factor in leisure travel.",김시연,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105938947

Even though a method to quantitatively evaluate the urban regeneration project is necessary, it is also needed to have a method to evaluate by using the objective and quantitative indexes. The quantitative evaluation method is an efficient method to be able to check numerical changes in accordance with urban regeneration project, and also to check relative changes through the comparison with the previous time point and comparative regions. Thus, this study aimed to verify changes in the project regions and comparative regions in accordance with the progress of urban regeneration project, with the use of big data. Targeting the urban regeneration priority regions designated in 2017, this study examined changes in the urban regeneration priority regions and surrounding comparative regions by using 13 indexes such as floating population, sales, number of new businesses, and number of licensing for buildings, and also verified changes in the urban regeneration priority regions compared to the comparative regions. On top of verifying changes in indexes in accordance with the lifecycle of urban regeneration priority project, the evaluation of urban regeneration project was performed.

(1) RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
There are many problems concerning housing in Korea as a result of a recent sharp run-up in real estate prices. This study sets out to review the characteristics of the housing policies implemented by successive Korean administrations, on the basis of which it analyses the overall level of public satisfaction with housing policies.
The number of administrations was limited to the five most recent governments from that led by President Choo Doo-hwan to the current administration headed by President Roh Moo-moo. A questionnaire survey was conducted asking respondents about their level of satisfaction with the real estate price stabilization policies, economic stimulation policies, anti-speculation policies and housing supply policies adopted by these administrations in order to elucidate the future direction of real estate policies.
(2) RESEARCH METHOD
the empirical analysis
(3) RESEARCH METHOD
First, the Chun Doo-hwan administration ranked highest in the level of satisfaction with real estate price stabilization policies, followed by the Kim Young-sam, Roh Tae-woo, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations. Actually, however, it was during the Kim Young-sam adminstr ation that real estate prices were most stable. Also, real estate prices soared most dramatically during the Roh Tae-woo and the Roh Moo-hyun administrations. Therefore, the low degree of satisfaction with real estate price stability under the Current Roh Moo-hyun government may be attributable to the hike in real estate prices. Second, analysis of the degree of satisfaction with real estate policy in regard to economic stimulation policies showed that the public was most satisfied with the Chun Doo-hwan government, followed respectively by the Roh Tae-woo, Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Roh Moo-hyun administrations. In the case of the Kim Young-sam and Rho Moo-hyun governments, real estate policies did not seem to have contributed greatly to boosting the national economy.

Lately it is the characteristics of real estate development that are getting more diverse, larger and more complex. So the risk of real estate development project is on the increase. Consequently the importance of risk management as the method that controls and minimizes the risk is increasing. This thesis brings UP the method of risk management classified the real estate development project into the stages of the assessment in advance, preparation of development, development, management and operation. The management of real estate development is divided into the recognition, analysis, and countermeasure of the risk.<BR>  (2) RESEARCH METHOD<BR>  It is used by survey and AHP method to achieve the purpose of this study.<BR>  The main themes of the thesis are the analysis and the countermeasure of the risk. In the analysis of risk is the relative importance analyzed by the method of AHP, and evaluated the risk factor through the linguistic variate reflected by the characteristic.<BR>  (3) RESEARCH RESULTS<BR>  In order to examine the appropriation of the method for the risk management presented in this thesis is the case study conducted.

Also, it is to help people who intend to participate in the real estate auction market in future estimate successful bids. Plus, it is to boost the real estate auction market through a theoretical analysis of the factors of the change to the successful bid rate, and to enhance the real estate auction earning rate.<BR>  (2) RESEARCH METHOD<BR>  The study conducted research by using data from the Korea Asset Management Corporation who undertake the management and sale of articles for sale at auction registered for courts nationwide. Also, the study analyzed the change of the successful bid rate by the purpose of real estate and by location mainly with articles for sale at auction of the Korea Asset Management Corporation. Then, the study organized social and economic background and factors of how the successful bid rate has been driven to change by dividing them into several types.<BR>  (3) R ESEARCH RESULTS<BR>  The factors affecting the successful bid rate is largely classified with a factor that changes the auction supply and a factor that changes the auction demand. Also, it was deduced that individual and corporate bankruptcy rates, closing of business, interest rate change, policies, and expecting psychology highly influence the two factors.<BR>  2. RESULTS<BR>  Real estate auction has been traditionally deemed to be traded at cheaper prices; however, it needs to determine the successful bid more rationally by considering possible risks and future uncertainty. In partiCl.llar, it is desirable to determine the successful bid with reference to the fluctuation rate of the successful bid rate for receiving the auction aimed at stuffs with similar conditions. When there are many bidders under the same conditions, people are likely to offer higher successful bids out of competitive mind, which leads to a lower ROI(Retum on Investment) as they reach almost the same price as the market price.<BR>  The factors of the changes to the successful bid rate were found significantly affected by individual and corporate bankruptcy rates, closing of business, future economic growth rate, and the change of real estate policies.",이정민(Lee Jeong Min),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108245474
서울시 홍대 주변 상권의 공간적 변화에 관한 연구,"1. CONTENTS (1) RESEARCH OBJECTIVES Recently, the spatial structure of commercial areas is rapidly changing. This phenomenon is of increasing interest as it relates to commercial gentrification. However, most of the previous studies that analyzed changes in commercial areas targeted a single time period or analyzed changes within a single commercial area. There are insufficient studies to detect spatial expansion of commercial districts and analyze their characteristics. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial change of the commercial area around Hongdae, Seoul.
(2) RESEARCH METHOD In this study, 38 commercial areas located around Hongdae were set as the spatial range and 2000-2019 was set as the temporal range. And opening and closing data of stores located within the spatial range were used as data for the study. As an analysis method, the center point, standard deviation distance, and standard deviation ellipse model that can confirm the spatial movement of commercial areas were used.
(3) RESEARCH FINDINGS The research findings of this study are as follows. First, the movement patterns of the commercial areas around Hongdae differ depending on the store type. The expansion of the Hongdae area occurred mainly through cafes. Third, it is difficult to specify the direction of store opening and closing.
2. RESULTS The results of the study are summarized as follows. First, the change in the center point of store opening & closing that occurs in the commercial areas around Hongdae is divided into two patterns. This is a pattern that moves from Hongdae to Mangwon, Hapjeong, and Yeonnam-dong, and a pattern that shows no significant change near Hongdae. Second, the standard deviation distance of cafe opening increases, which means that the expansion of commercial areas near Hongdae is mainly through cafes. Third, it is difficult to confirm a clear change in the degree of deflection in the standard deviation elliptic model. Therefore, it is difficult to confirm the tendency of the opening and closing of stores in a specific direction.",김혜림,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108652368

A comparison between redevelopment and reconstruction projects are analyzed in terms of regime styles and early business stage characteristics using STATA program based on the data for the status of maintenance projects of the National Statistical Office. Research findings indicate that both project characteristics and macroeconomic factors continuously influence each project and the biggest impact factor is the implementation of floor area ratio. It is also noted that redevelopment projects are affected by more various factors than reconstruction projects. Reconstruction projects appear to be more influenced by the characteristics of maintenance zones.

As a result of the analysis, it could be captured that variables significantly affect on real estate prices in each regime. First, it was found that during the boom, the policy to strengthen real estate regulations did not have an effective influence on stabilizing the housing sales market. Second, it was found that deregulation and strengthening policies had an effective effect on each market during the recession and boom of the jeonse market. Third, ρ11 and ρ22, which are the probabilities of the transition, show a phase of recession and boom, respectively, and the real estate market is all more likely to maintain the recession. Third, ρ11 and ρ22, which are the probabilities of the transition, represent the phase of recession and boom, respectively. ρ11 is larger than ρ22, so the housing sales, jeonse, and land markets are more likely to maintain the recession.

However, research on young single-person households has been relatively recent. Research on single-person households has mostly focused on all single-person households or elderly single-person households, and comparative research between different age groups is lacking. Therefore, this study categorizes all single-person households into young, middle-aged, and elderly groups to investigate the differences in the factors that affect their residential satisfaction and to analyze how these residential environment factors affect life satisfaction through the mediating effect of residential satisfaction. The 2020 Seoul Survey Urban Policy Index Survey data were analyzed using a structural equation model to investigate the impact of each factor. First, a finding is that various residential environment factors directly affect residential satisfaction and life satisfaction. Next, it was found that residential satisfaction directly affects life satisfaction in the models of young and middle-aged single-person households. Through this, it was confirmed that there are differences in residential environment factors that affect residential satisfaction and that residential satisfaction plays an important mediating role. Finally, it was found that the factors that affect the residential and life satisfaction of young single-person households are more diverse compared to other age groups. This study provides policy implications that age group differences should be considered first in order to improve the residential and life satisfaction of single-person households.

To do so, this study employed random effect logistic regression models with the dataset of the 2008-2020 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging. The findings are as follows. First, it was found that the interaction with their children increased the probability of residential mobility for older Koreans in both metropolitan areas and non-metropolitan areas. Second, as age increased, the interaction with their children tended to further promote residential mobility for older Koreans, but such effects varied depending on related variables. Third, it was confirmed that the possibility of further promoting residential mobility for older Koreans increased through the interaction effects of the variables associated with the interaction with their children.

The government is actively promoting population decline response policies and designating 89 population decline areas. It is necessary to promote efficient projects according to the characteristics of population decline regions. Therefore, this paper conducted a cluster analysis by selecting indicators based on the population decline index, which was the basis for the designation of population decline areas, and completed a regional characteristic analysis for 89 areas selected by the local government based on the population decline index and categorized them into three clusters to analyze the characteristics of each cluster and suggest policy response directions. Cluster 1 showed that policies to prevent the departure of declining businesses in the area, the supply of new housing, and the provision of welfare facilities for the elderly were required. Cluster 2 required settlement support policies for the settlement of the daytime population, the creation of welfare facilities for the elderly and vulnerable, and support policies for the stable settlement of businesses. Cluster 3 explored policies for the welfare of the elderly, the supply of new housing, the maintenance of vacant houses, the expansion of local finances, and the support of urban-to-rural Migration.

This research examines the formation of the recent real estate price in Korea and diagnoses the possibility of depression by compared with the macro-economy index of 1990's macro-economy in Japan. In addition it provides the suggestion in order to overcome our difficult situation such as the unstable real estate market and prepare the possibility of deep depression.
(2) RESEARCH METHOD
In order to exam the possibility of the current real estate bubble, secondary data from first data obtained by Korean government, Bank, and so on are developed. Comparison method is used to compare Korean economy with Japan's. The informations of current policy are collected from the web-sites and articles
(3) RESEARCH RESULTS
This research presents the existence of real estate bubble but it is not dangerous level to be worried., There is not a possibility of bubble collapse because of low LTV, potential demand of residential house, and government's confrontation plan. However economy seems not easy to derail from depression due to high oil price and low export volume by Korean currency appreciation.
The possibility of long-term depression exits if Korean government insists the current real estate policy and does not prepare the possibility of depression.
2. RESULTS
We propose the possible solutions to escape from the long-term depression. 1) Government should not use too strong regulation policy of real estate to prevent real demand, 2) Government should focus on the preparation of depression not only the regulation of real estate. 3)It must prepare the suppression system which closes the excessive trust expansion of the financial institution against the hazard mortgage financing. 4) The trust among social members should be recovered to remove negative consuming habit and unstable future and the vision must be shown to achieve social value.

Therefore, it is necessary to assess the dynamic changes in boundaries and hierarchies of market areas from long-term and practical perspective. Accordingly this study analyzed the changes in boundaries and hierarchies of market areas in Seoul past 20 years and the actual effect of central place system in Urban Master Plan for Seoul in light of this analysis. This study divides the boundaries of market areas in Seoul into small-scale community units using Hydrology Model. The analysis result of changes in boundaries shows high-density growth in urban center and southeastern market areas. The analysis result of changes in hierarchies shows development tendency centered on urban center and Gang-nam market areas, which means Urban Master Plan for Seoul has not effectively achieved its goal of dispersal for balanced development.
This study identifies actual effectiveness of central place system in Urban Master Plan for Seoul through scientific methodology and empirical analysis. Also the significance of this study is found in the point that some implications on market activation strategy and policy making of Seoul can be deduced. However, this study has limitation in that hierarchies of market areas are explained only by density and scale of them. Therefore following study ought to supplement other variables so that it can deduce more precise result.",오영기,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101390633
대중교통 이용률을 높이기 위한 공유 전동킥보드의 수요 주도형 배분 방법 연구,"Due to excessive dependence on automobile transportation, interest in environmental issues has increased, and the need to use public transportation has increased. However, the out-of-vehicle time that occurs when using public transport has a negative impact on people's use of public transport. PM(Personal Mobility), which has recently been attracting attention, is first-last mile mobility suitable for dramatically reducing out-of-vehicle time. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to present a flexible arrangement method for each time period of PM through analysis of the usage pattern of PM consumers. PM peak time was divided into three categories, and network analysis was performed to derive flexible stops where PMs could be placed just before the peak time. It was found that the demand level and demand location of the PM were affected by time, and it was determined that the purpose of using the PM was also affected by time.",최혜정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105288891
