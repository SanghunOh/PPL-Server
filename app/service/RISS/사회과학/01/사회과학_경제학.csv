To do so, it is collected posts related to no-kids zone on Twitter, one of the social media platforms, and examined what topics are being debated in Korean society. It is extracted posts related to no-kids zones on Twitter from January 1, 2017 to August 30, 2022 using web crawling, and after preprocessing, TF and TF-IDF, degree centrality, closeness and betweenness centrality, and CONCOR analysis on a total of 32,330 tweets were conducted. The findings revealed the following. People and places directly related to no-kids zones, such as children, people, cafes, adults, and parents, were the most frequent, but hate and discrimination were also frequently mentioned. Keywords such as child, person, adult, cafe, parent, society, hate, discrimination, shop, restaurant were high in all centralities. Finally, 6 clusters were extracted; “parent/mom issues”, “discrimination and hate”, “no-kids zone_display issues”, “no-kids zone_confirmation issues”, “no-kids zone_acceptable”, and “only Twitter.” are receiving a great deal of public attentions. The overall trend of the no-kids zones discussion on Twitter is that the problem of social exclusion and discrimination is justified as a problem of children’s, mothers’, and parents’ deviance and lack of control, which partially captures the current state of the no-kids zones controversy.",이연수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108049077
통화정책과 은행의 역할,"The novelty of the model is the embedding into a variant of the standard monetary general equilibrium framework of a micro-founded banking sector motivated by Goodfriend and McCallum (2007, GM henceforth), which allows for the presence of an external finance premium as a source of business fluctuations. A closed economy DSGE model is implemented quantitatively by applying the Bayesian likelihood approach, with calibration based on the Korean data. The presence of the external finance premium in the model turns out to matter quantitatively for the transmission of monetary policy, due to the potential for amplification of the real effects of expansionary monetary policy through a countercyclical banking ""accelerator."" Meanwhile the magnitude and persistence of the real effects are relatively weaker than those in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and others, owing to the presence of a banking ""attenuator"" at work to attenuate the accelerator effect as in GM (2007). As another experiment, the desired monetary policy responses to a positive goods productivity shock and a negative collateral shock are compared to what is required when a central bank does not consider the effect of the presence of banking. The results reveal that, in order to stabilize modest deflation, monetary policy needs to be more accommodative in response to each shock than what is implied in the model without a banking sector. Finally, among the relative welfare performances of alternative monetary policy rules that include financial variables such as credit aggregates and asset prices as independent arguments in a standard Taylor rule (including output gap), we find that the central bank invariably attains a lower level of loss, and thereby stabilization gain, when responding positively to credit aggregates than it does when responding to other financial variables. The evidence provides renewed insight on the potential benefits of considering credit (monetary) aggregates in the interest rate policy actions.",김현의,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268121
불확실성에서의 의사결정과 확률: 케인즈와 행동경제학,"This paper discusses the effect of ‘Das Maynard Keynes Problem’ on the comparison between keynesian economics and behavioral economics. In spite of the similarity between two schools, there also exist the arguments on the fundamental differences between them. These contrast views on the relationship between Keynes and behavioral economics result from the interpretation on the (dis)continuity of Keynes’s two books, A Treatise on Probability and The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money.
Whereas the emphasis on the continuity in Keynes’s thought does not maintain the status of The General Theory as the basis of behavioral macroeconomics, the argument for discontinuity in Keynes’s probability theory decreases the similarity of A Treatise on Probability with behavioral decision making theory under uncertainty.",황재홍,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108039867
대학서열과 생애임금격차,"This paper examines the association between university ranking and the earnings of graduates over their working life. The wage premium for the highest ranking starts from 24.6% for the 25-29 year age group and rises to 50.5% for the 40-44 year age group. It declines thereafter and disappears for the 55-59 year age group. This pattern is closely related to the workers’ employment conditions such as tenure, the size of the workplace, and wage-earner status. We also find the workers’ abilities developed before and after the entrance to university are correlated with the wage gap.",이지영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100217350
"좋은 옷, 좋은 가격'의 파크랜드","We report on a case study of Parkland Corp., a leading man’s apparel company in Korea, which has achieved substantial growth and profitability through effective customer-oriented marketing strategies. By offering customers high-quality products at a reasonable price range, Parkland has not only enjoyed a remarkable success in a highly competitive man’s apparel market, but also established a positive brand image by promoting a healthy consumption culture. The findings of this case study offer practical implications for companies that seek ways to strengthen their marketing competency. This paper highlights three aspects of Parkland’s innovation effort that underlies its success. First, the company found the right niche market by thinking out of the box. In a time when the economic downturn pushed competitors to jump on the offshore bandwagon and to focus on overseas markets, Parkland made a completely different strategic move to adapt to the changing businesslandscape. The company instead increased its domestic manufacturing capacity and strengthened its focus on the domestic market. Second, Parkland customized its offerings to the needs of its focused niche market segment and launched marketing campaigns to effectively reach out to its target customer base. Lastly, the company overcame the cost and quality dilemma through technology innovation and productivity improvement. On one hand, to meet the cost pressure, Parkland undertook business process improvement initiatives and renovated its logistics system. On the other hand, the company achieved a significant productivity improvement by introducing an advanced sewing technology to the production lines. As a transformative industry leader, Parkland has transformed the whole apparel industry, which was once labor-intensive, into a technology-intensive industry. It should be also noted that the CEO's leadership and his management philosophy made it possible to realize Parkland’s aforementioned transformative initiatives. Thanks to its business case, Parkland has received an industry-wide recognition and a number of prestigious awards.","김광수(Kim, Kwang Soo)",2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108736831
"세계화, 성장, 불평등과 빈곤에 대한 고찰","This paper examines globalization, economic growth, inequality and poverty through literature research. The advocate of globalization argues that advances in globalization lead to high economic growth and a reduction in inequality and poverty in developing countries. However, an analysis of empirical experiences has confirmed that the claim that catch-up growth is possible is practically difficult to realize in developing countries. In addition, the analysis of global income and consumption inequality and poverty trends related to the progress of globalization showed that overall income and consumption inequality has increased since the 1980s, with 900 million people, or 12.8% of the world s population, living below the $1.9 poverty line per day as of 2012. With the fruits of growth concentrated on the financial sector and the top class, it is necessary for developing countries to provide adequately opportunities and incentives while presenting systematic policies suitable for sustainable growth and to expand opportunities for the poor to participate in growth beyond the financial means for redistribution of income rather than simply accepting prescriptions from the standpoint of advocating globalization.",윤성종(Sungjong Yun),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268111
노인독거가구의 삶의 질 연구,"This study attempted to propose an implementation direction of consumer policy to emphasize consumer support for elderly single households in the upcoming super-aged society. In order to carry out the research purpose, the characteristics of elderly single households were examined, the health status (physical and psychological health status) and economic status of elderly single households were considered, and the factors affecting the quality of life of each type of elderly single household were examined. Specifically, it was intended to suggest that it is necessary to diversify consumer policies of elderly single-family households through the analysis of the quality of life by type of elderly.
As a result of categorizing them into two groups to understand the characteristics of elderly single households in detail, they showed that they were mentally and physically sick and in poor economic conditions, had a lot of non-employment, low household income and total expenditure, and mainly lived in metropolitan cities. In addition, consumers with a healthy mind and body, high total household income and total expenditure, low age, somewhat higher education, more education, but distributed in Seoul, while total expenditure was higher than total household income.
Based on these results, it is proposed that it is necessary to change the consumer policy direction and paradigm suitable for the characteristics of elderly single households. And when considering the variables, degree of influence, and direction that affect the quality of life of elderly single households. It is necessary to understand gender differentiation, characteristics of family relationships, and characteristics of residential areas of elderly single households. Specifically, it is a group that should pay attention to elderly single-family households who are sick and in poor economic conditions, and the role and responsibility of the consumer protection system should be strengthened by suggesting the necessity of social education related to consumption.",김시월,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76488480
국민건강보험 빅데이터를 활용한 미래 질병부담 및 의료비 추정 연구,"The aging population and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases have led to a surge in disease burden and medical expenses, prompting an urgent need for proactive healthcare, while the evaluation of medical and economic feasibility remains insufficient. This study proposes a methodology for evaluating the medical and economic feasibility of healthcare using National Health Insurance Service database and big data analysis techniques. A disease burden index, which considers the severity of various diseases, is proposed, and a 10-year cumulative index is estimated using health checkup indicators. The impact of healthcare on medical cost reduction is illustrated through the alleviation of the disease burden index with an example of a healthcare program. Finally, the importance of health care is emphasized from the perspective of health care policy and financial sustainability of NHIS.",홍석철,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107850877
주택가격 상승기의 부동산 규제정책이 투자심리와 주택가격에 미치는 영향 - 서울시를 중심으로 -,"This study was designed to investigate whether the response of investor sentiment to shocks in real estate policies results in differences in the stabilization effect on housing prices. For this purpose, the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was established by variables including housing prices, investor sentiment measured by multi-dimensions and real estate policies categorized by types. Thenimpulse response functions were also conducted. The results suggested that real estate policies tend to be announced in response to shift in investor sentiment, rather than being proactively introduced. It was found that investor sentiment notably decreases in response to shock from real estate policies and housing prices tend to decrease substantially in response to shocks from real estate policies when they rise significantly in response to shock from investor sentiment. This study is distinctive in terms of analysis for housing price stabilization of real estate policies as it categorized real estate policies by types and took into account multi-dimensional measurement of investor sentiment. The study is significant in its analysis of the relationships between real estate policies during periods ofrapid rise in housing prices, investor sentiment and real estate policies.",주종웅,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107074413
국민연금 재정관리방식의 문제점과 제도적 선진화 방안 연구,"The current discussion about the security of pensions from the statutory pension insurance against the background of the population ageing foreseeable for the coming decades has revived the discussion about the optimal or adequate financing method for statutory pension schemes. In case of Germany this question seems to have been answered in favor of the pay-as-you-go system. Even when the 1992 pension reform law was passed at the end of 1989, there was a broad consensus to stick to the pay-as-you-go system.
All those involved had claimed that the financial consequences of the expected demographic development should be shared equally between pensioners, the insured people and the federal government. To this end, a self-regulation mechanism was used to link the development of contributions, net wage-based pension adjustments and the federal subsidy in such a way that contribution rate increases lead to a reduction in the annual pension adjustment and at the same time to a corresponding increase in the federal subsidy.
The key concerns here are as follow - (1) the size of fiscal mobilization required to operate each year, - (2) the size of reserve funds needed to cover future total expected benefits, - (3) the level of premiums required to secure such funds.
In general, the method of selecting a financial management method and implementing it at the same time is judged to be a task that needs to be identified and judged on a ""political level"" rather than a ""legal level"" due to its characteristics.",이정우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108558859

"쓰레기 분리수거 의도에 영향을 미치는 단순존재효과, 친환경 태도, 그리고 자의식의 역할","This study investigated the effect of the presence of another person and an individual's eco-friendly attitude on the intention to separate garbage to promote eco-friendly behavior. The situation was set with two conditions: being alone and being with another person. The interaction between the presence of another person and eco-friendly attitudes was analyzed to confirm how social influence due to the presence of others affects the intention to separate garbage. Additionally, it was investigated whether the presence of another person and the influence of eco-friendly attitudes on garbage separation are mediated by self-consciousness. Self-consciousness was divided into private and public self-consciousness.
According to the research results, the intention to separate garbage was higher under the condition of being with anyone than under the condition of being alone, and the higher the eco-friendly attitude was, the higher the intention to separate garbage was. In the interaction between the presence of another person and the eco-friendly attitude, there was no difference in the intention to separate garbage under the condition of high eco-friendly attitude. However, under conditions with low eco-friendly attitudes, being with another person showed a higher intention to separate garbage than being alone. Analyzing the mediating effect of self-consciousness, public self-consciousness was found to mediate the influence of the presence of another person on the intention to separate garbage, and private self-consciousness was found to mediate the influence of eco-friendly attitude on the intention to separate garbage.
This study confirmed the effect of social influence on individual eco-friendly behavior, and the reason could be found in the individual's public self-consciousness. However, it was found that an individual's eco-friendly attitude was more important than the social influence, such as the presence of another person. This is why the effect of social influence is insignificant for individuals with a strong eco-friendly attitude. Therefore, to strengthen an individual's eco-friendly attitude, it is necessary to continuously provide education on environmental protection and eco-friendly behavior.",김담율,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108567374
디지털 소비자사회화는 어떻게 이루어지는가? 세대 비교를 중심으로,"This study establishes a digital consumer socialization model by identifying the major socialization agents and mechanism, and by exploring the main forms and process of digital consumer socialization. To compare generational differences, we conducted focus group interview once per each generation such as baby boomers, Generation X, Y, and Z. The respondents consist of 29 women aged 21 to 64 that have experienced digital consumption more than once a month. Their responses were summarized and interpreted using Colaizzi’s phenomenological method.
The digital consumer socialization agents include an online search platform, social media, and business homepage through which consumers socialize by themselves, and family, influencers, acquaintances, and employees of customer service center or offline stores that consumers with interact through observation and compliance. Otherwise, the interaction between the mass media, school, and government agencies was not active in all generations. The online search platform was the most active agent in all generations, while baby boomers were relatively more active in interacting with family(children), Generation X with acquaintances and businesses, and Generations Y and Z with influencers/social media. The distinctive forms of digital consumer socialization include bench-marking, self, reciprocal, and dependent socialization, among which self-socialization was the principal form in all generations. The schematized model of digital consumer socialization illustrates the process that starts from bench-marking to reciprocal or dependent socialization based on self-socialization. After that, if consumers were satisfied with the socialization, the corresponding form of socialization was fixed, and conversely, if they were dissatisfied or gave up further socialization, the socialization was stopped. Based on the results, this study provided basic data to develop generation-specific policy and educational plans for effective digital consumer socialization.",전상민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99780847
한국 유통업체의 ESG 경영현황과 전략시사점,"For the sustainable development of mankind, society, and business, companies must pay attention to not only financial performance but also non-financial performance. This is the starting point and necessity of ESG management. As a measure of corporate sustainability, ESG is the evolution and specification of corporate social responsibility (CSR), and is standardized and institutionalized. ESG management is a practice that complies with ESG evaluation standards and is the standard value of the lowest standard pursued by a company. Recognizing the seriousness of global environmental problems (e.g., environmental disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis and the emergence of the COVID-19 virus) and exploring solutions (spreading good consumption values, leading the MZ generation/strengthening of laws and institutional regulations, especially carbon neutrality, improving working conditions, and fair trade), the social influence, role, and expectations of companies are growing accordingly. Thus, the necessity of new management values and evaluation standards was raised. Investors are demanding that companies disclose information on ESG activities and communicate with various stakeholders. Evidence of the operation of management systems and compliance with sustainable management practices for the environment, society and customers is also increasing. Recently, as international organizations and initiatives on environmental and social issues and policy changes of individual countries have been strengthened, the roles and responsibilities of corporate business are also increasing. The purpose of this study is to understand the ESG management status of Korean retailers based on understanding the clear difference between CSR/CSV and ESG, and to develop ESG strategies and other strategies for Korean retailers through comparative analysis with overseas retailers to draw policy implications. Therefore, this thesis will contribute to the spread of ESG management in the Korean distribution industry and expansion of new investment opportunities. What sets this study apart from existing ESG research is that it was the first study of ESG management by Korean retailers, And that the characteristics were derived. Furthermore, the differential contribution of this thesis is that it suggested an ESG strategy that Korean retailers should benchmark and the government's policy support plan through a comparative analysis of overseas cases of ESG and Korean retailers.",김익성,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100057661
지방소멸대응기금의 도입 현황 및 향후 발전방안,"The Local Extension Reaction Fund is meaningful as a direct financial support measure for the central government to support local governments for the purpose of preventing Regional Extinction. This study began with the recognition that the inspection of the current state is important for the active use of the Local Extension Reaction Fund. This study aims to derive an improvement plan by comprehensively analyzing the current status and characteristics of the Local Extension Reaction Fund in operation so far. To this end, the introduction process, status, and characteristics of the Local Extension Reaction Fund were analyzed, problems were derived, and future improvement plans of the Local Extension Reaction Fund were presented.
The current status and problems of the Local Extension Reaction Fund derived in this study are as follows. First, since the Local Extension Reaction Fund is temporarily operated from 2022 to 2031, it is difficult to establish a long-term plan of more than 10 years. Second, the Local Extension Reaction Fund analyzes performance every fiscal year, so it is likely to focus on short-term performance. Third, as the Local Extension Reaction Fund is urgently promoted, it can be biased toward plans to utilize the Local Extension Reaction Fund piecemeal. Fourth, there is a limitation in that there is not enough incentive for local governments to receive the Local Extension Reaction Fund and actively use it in regional extension-related projects. Fifth, when Local governments established an investment plan for the Local Extension Reaction Fund, they did not collect opinions from residents or go through the resident participation process.
The future improvement plans for this are as follows. First, it is possible to consider using the Local Extension Reaction Fund even after 2031, by deleting the sunset deadline of the Local Extension Reaction Fund. Second, Individual post-consulting may be conducted according to the results of performance analysis so that the Local Extension Reaction Fund does not focus on short-term performance. It is possible to hold a competition for best practices and reward excellent local governments. Third, a long-term strategy is needed to solve the problem of local extinction by using the Local Extinction Response Fund. Fourth, local governments that actively respond to the regional extension problem will not be disadvantaged by the general local share tax, and special local share tax will be issued to motivate the use of the Local Extension Reaction Fund. Fifth, local residents should be interested in preventing the disappearance of their area, discover ideas to utilize the local extinction response fund, and cooperate with basic local governments.",류영아,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76486197
