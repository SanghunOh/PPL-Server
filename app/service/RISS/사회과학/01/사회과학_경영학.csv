Starting with the Business Roundtable (BRT) declaration, the main principle of corporate governance is to consider all stakeholders of a company, including the customers, employees, partners, and local community, in shareholder capitalism that values the short-term interests of shareholders. Thus, with the transition to stakeholder capitalism, whether a company’s ESG management respects not only shareholders but also these stakeholders and meets their needs and interests has become more important. Therefore, based on a range of theories, such as stakeholder, social exchange, corporate reputation, social responsibility, and relationship marketing theories, this study examined the structural relationship between customer trust, satisfaction, and loyalty, which are key performance variables of ESG management and marketing. To verify the hypothesis, data were collected through an online survey targeting 150 members of the public, and Process MACRO (Model 6) was used to analyze the results. ESG management activities were found to have a significant positive (+) effect on loyalty by mediating both trust and satisfaction individually. It was also found that trust and satisfaction played a dual mediating role in the relationship between ESG management activities and loyalty. In other words, ESG management activities were found to have a positive effect on loyalty by mediating trust or satisfaction without directly affecting loyalty or by mediating trust and satisfaction together. This study focused on customer loyalty, which has been overlooked to date in ESG research for marketing, and identified for the first time the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between ESG management and loyalty (ESG management→trust→satisfaction→loyalty). This study also suggests that ESG management can be a useful practical marketing tool for strengthening customer loyalty.",허종호,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108172478

인터넷 기업의 ESG 경영: 네이버와 카카오의 사례분석,"One of the things emphasized for domestic and foreign companies today is ESG management in terms of sustainability. In order to cope with the global crisis of climate change, all companies are required to reduce the amount of carbon generated in the production and sales processes. In addition, positive contributions to society and transparent corporate governance are required. In particular, in the case of Internet companies, differences are found in many aspects from existing companies. They are also responding to regulations such as the government, society, and public opinion through various ESG activities. Accordingly, it is meaningful to analyze ESG activities of domestic Internet companies that are ranked 100th in the world. Therefore, this study summarized the background of Internet companies and ESG, and examined the ESG activities of Naver and Kakao, which can be said to be representatives of domestic Internet companies. Based on the ESG evaluation tables and management reports of Naver and Kakao, case analysis was conducted to summarize how the platform is used in environmental management, social responsibility, and governance. Finally, by explaining platform-based social value creation activities executed by Naver and Kakao in the COVID-19 situation, we tried to show differences in ESG activities with existing companies.",강나연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76486481
MZ세대의 세대차이 지각정도가 이직의도 및 직무소진에 미치는 영향: 세대갈등의 매개효과 및 조직공정성의 조절효과를 중심으로,"This study investigates the relationship between perceived Generation Gap among Millennials and Gen Z within an organization and their Turnover Intention and burnout. Additionally, it explores whether Generation Conflict mediates the relationship between perceived Generation Gap and Turnover Intention and burnout, and whether Organizational Fairness moderates the relationship between Generation Conflict and these outcomes. The theoretical background of all variables, including the characteristics of Millennials and Gen Z, perceived Generation Gap, Generation Conflict, Turnover Intention, burnout, and Organizational Fairness, is examined based on previous research. Data from a survey of 500 Millennials and Gen Z workers is used for empirical analysis, and the results are statistically analyzed as follows: First, as perceived Generation Gap among Millennials and Gen Z increase, their Turnover Intention also increases. Furthermore, except for differences in behavior, as perceived Generation Gap increase, burnout also increases. Second, Generation Conflict partially mediates the relationship between perceived Generation Gap, Turnover Intention, and burnout. Third, Organizational Fairness partially moderates the relationship between Generation Conflict, Turnover Intention, and job burnout.
In conclusion, a greater perception of Generation Gap among Millennials and Gen Z leads to increased Generation Conflict, job turnover intentions, and burnout. Mediation by Generation Conflict can further increase job turnover intentions and burnout. However, increased Organizational Fairness can reduce negative job turnover intentions and burnout, thus improving organizational effectiveness.
Therefore, to address Generation Conflicts caused by differences in generational perception, organizational fairness must be ensured. In particular, Millennials and Gen Z workers consider fair treatment within the organization important, so increasing fairness can increase their trust and sense of responsibility towards the organization, ultimately preventing human resource losses due to employee turnover and burnout.",김연수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108110454

Authentic leadership has been defined in various ways, most conceptualizations and research espouse the fundamental notion of being true to one's self and often considered the root construct of other leadership. Authentic leaders encourage the development of the people around them by practicing real values, beliefs and behaviors, being subordinate oriented and making honest evaluations of the behavior and performance of employees. That means authentic leaders are ethical, transparent, openness to change, involve their subordinates in decision-making, and encourage positive attitudes and behaviors, which in turn advance organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to investigate that authentic leadership affect employees’ in-role and innovative behavior. Also, informal learning mediate those of relationship and perceived organizational vision salience(POVS) moderate between authentic leadership and informal learning. Authentic leadership are consist of self-awareness and self-regulation. Based on literature review, we set the direct, mediate, moderate and moderated mediation(conditionally indirect) effect hypothesis. To test hypothesis, survey method were performed by using questionnaires. Questionnaires are collected by 2nd times(T1, T2) such as 3 month time lag, to remove common method bias. At T1 period, we measure authentic leadership, informal learning and POVS, and then T2 period, in-role and innovative behavior. Total 369 questionnaires are used for analysis using Process Macro(Hayes, 2018). This study results are as follows. First, authentic leadership have positive impact on both of in-role, innovative behavior and informal learning. Second, informal learning have positive impact on employees’ in-role and innovative behavior. Third, POVS have positive impact on informal learning and moderate between authentic leadership and informal learning. Fourth, informal learning mediate between authentic leadership and in-role, innovative behavior. Finally, the relationship of authentic leadership and in-role that show mediation effect of informal learning boost-up under high on POVS as conditionally indirect effect. All of our hypothesis(H1, H2, H3, H4) are supported. Our results reveal that authentic leadership are critical antecedent of employees’ in-role and innovative behavior.
And authentic leadership increase informal learning and then, if high on informal learning increase employees’ in role and innovative behavior. If high on POVS, the positive relationship of authentic leadership and informal learning are greater than compared with low on POVS. Specially, if high on POVS, mediation effect of informal learning are more stronger. Based on the results, this study have theoretical and practical implications which authentic leadership, workplace learning concept and organizational vision of role for in-role and innovative behavior of employees.",김태은,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76485873
ESG경영에 대한 분석과 이해: ㈜셀트리온 사례를 중심으로,"The main purpose of this study is to enhance the understanding of non-financial management, which has become increasingly important, by analyzing the environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) of Celltrion Inc. The analysis was conducted for the period from 2017 to 2019. It was found that, in terms of the environment, Celltrion has been making efforts to improve its environmental management, environmental education, carbon emission management, and environmental hazardous substances management. However, Celltrion’s efforts to develop eco-friendly products have been somewhat insufficient. With regard to its social efforts, Celltrion has sought to improve its human resource management system by increasing female recruitment, salaries, and welfare benefits and to increase its industrial and product safety. However, its donation-related activity has been insignificant, thus improvement is necessary in this area. Finally, in evaluating its governance, the extent to which it has promoted voting rights has been low, and the absence of outside female directors is somewhat disappointing. This study is meaningful in that users can obtain non-financial information from companies based on the disclosed ESG information and use this for decision-making. In addition, this study highlights the need for improvement in ESG management by identifying the level of a company’s sustainability management. Celltrion has not published any sustainability management reports.

진정성 있는 브랜드 액티비즘 전략에 관한 사례연구: 천연화장품 브랜드 러쉬(Lush)를 중심으로,"This study analyzed the strategy of Lush, the most notable brand among companies that practice brand activism. Brand activism refers to a brand's public and active stance on social and political issues. Lush not only emphasizes marketing strategies for brand performance, but also actively expresses its opinions and takes actions on social or political issues, separate from its profits, practicing brand activism. By consistently carrying out such activism while focusing on actions rather than just message delivery, Lush has been evaluated as an authentic brand. In this study, success factors of Lush were analyzed from the perspective of authentic brand activism through various literature reviews and campaign cases. Lush demonstrates outstanding brand activism in three dimensions: practice, sacrifice, and inclusion. First, it is important to demonstrate the message conveyed through practice. Second, Lush is willing to incur financial sacrifice, such as expenditure and practical donations, to maintain its beliefs. This action maximizes Lush's authenticity. Third, Lush practices brand activism internally, pursuing an inclusive welfare policy in which all members can benefit. As demonstrated by the case of Lush, to practice authentic brand activism, it is important to not only apply it to external marketing targeting end consumers but also apply it to internal marketing, which incorporates it into corporate culture and policies. In other words, when a foundation for actively sharing and practicing brand activism is established within a company, successful brand activism strategies can be achieved.",이민경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105596624

This study uses a panel model consisting of variables representing the ESG scores, firm-specific advantages and a interaction of balanced ESG management. The results show that governance is particularly negative on corporate performance. Besides, environmental and social activities are no correlation between Tobin’s Q and financial performance. In Korea, ESG management can be evaluated as a factor that corporate financial performance is still incurring opportunity costs rather than investment benefits. However it was possible to confirm the positive moderating effect of ESG on the relationship between balanced ESG management and financial performance. It was found that high balanced ESG management strategies has a stronger positive effect on corporate performance than low group balanced. The nature of a balanced ESG management strategy can control the optimization of operational mechanisms by considering the interrelationships among ESG activities.

"꼰대, 한국기업 조직문화 차원의 탐구","The purpose of this study is to explore the phenomenon of kkondae and to interpret it for Korean companies from organizational culture perspective. The important evidences for understanding the Korean society and company can be ‘kkondae’ and its culture in that the it has been used more frequently to explain various social phenomena. Nevertheless, few existing academic studies have been conducted, so this study analyzed the big data of social media that Korean employees has used the most. We also looked at the perception of kkondae and its cultures in various aspects through text-mining methodology such as topic modeling. As a result, interest in kkondae has increased explosively in Korean society since 2017, and most of cases in the organization have been used as terms to refer to superiors in the organizational structure, those who enforces norms and goals of the group, and those who take up their seats despite their lack of ability. Next, those who subjectively recognized kkondae and its culture tended to underrate their organizational culture. These results can contribute to academia by suggesting that if the members who were dissatisfied with the organizational culture recognized the members who worked together as kkondae, the probability could be high. In addition, it is meaningful that kkondae do not exist simply as old people, but can be recognized as kkondae by their attitudes and values, which can be presented to the members through human resource activities.",김성준,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107582247
MZ세대의 직무만족요인이 이직의도에 미치는 영향,"In recent times, the Generation MZ cohort has been taking a leading role in various sectors of society, driving generational shifts and becoming pivotal players. Since 2020, their economic participation has surpassed that of previous generations, making them crucial in the realm of corporate management. The purpose of this study is to investigate job satisfaction and turnover intention among Generation MZ employees working in domestic small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) based on their individual characteristics. Additionally, the study aims to uncover the impact of job satisfaction factors on turnover intention, thereby contributing to strategic human resource management in SMEs.


This study utilizes a mixed-methods approach, encompassing both a literature review and empirical research. The literature review provides theoretical insights on Generation MZ, job satisfaction factors, and turnover intention, forming the foundation for hypotheses and research models. To empirically examine these objectives, data was collected from Generation MZ employees in domestic SMEs from February 15th to April 14th, 2023, using a convenience sampling method. A total of 209 responses were gathered, and IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 was used to validate the hypotheses. The results indicate that job satisfaction among Generation MZ employees in domestic SMEs varies based on individual characteristics such as gender, final education level, type of employing company, tenure at the current workplace, position, and monthly salary. Similarly, turnover intention among Generation MZ employees is influenced by individual characteristics such as gender, final education level, number of dependents, type of employing company, tenure at the current workplace, position, and monthly salary. Furthermore, the study reveals that as job satisfaction decreases among Generation MZ employees in domestic SMEs, turnover intention increases, and vice versa.


These findings are expected to serve as a foundational resource for supporting Generation MZ employees in understanding and regulating their job satisfaction and turnover intention through education and training. Additionally, it can guide SMEs in enhancing their organizational culture and innovating HR systems to accommodate the unique characteristics of Generation MZ, thus paving the way for policy alternatives for effective human resource management.",김태균,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107993000

However, the question naturally arises regarding what forms of leadership are best suited for these structures and will promote the attainment of performance?. At this point, early leadership researchers argued that the importance of leadership being shared among team members.
Shared leadership as results from the distribution of leadership influence across all of team members and mutual influence embedded in the interactions among team members that can significantly improve team and organizational performance. That is shared leadership occurs when all members of a team are fully engaged in the leadership of the team and are not hesitant to influence and guide their fellow team members in an effort to maximize the potential of the team as a whole.
This study purpose to investigate relationship between shared leadership, change self-efficacy, collectivistic orientation and change-oriented organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) at team level analysis that show clear the process and context of shared leadership influences. More detalied, examined the effect of shared leadership foster employees’ change-oriented OCB and reflected mediating effect of change self-efficacy, the moderating effect of collectivistic value orientation was regarded as a contextual factor.
After literature review, we set the direct hypothesis, mediate hypothesis, moderate hypothesis and moderated mediation hypothesis. For test of hypothesis, we conducted survey method and to removed the common method bias problem, questionnaires are collected by multi-source(team leader, team member) and check the aggregation of individual responds to using team level(rwg, ICC(1), ICC(2)). Total 416 team members and 98 teams used for final analysis.
The results show that shared leadership have positive impacts on change-oriented OCB and change self-efficacy. Change self-efficacy has a positive impact on change-oriented OCB.
Also, change self-efficacy mediate between shared leadership and change-oriented OCB.
Collectivistic value orientation moderate between shared leadership and change self-efficacy.
If high on collectivistic value orientation, the those of relationship are more increased.
Finally, moderated mediations are significant that change self-efficacy mediation of effect are more strong under high on collectivistic value orientation, reflected of conditional indirect effect.
Based on the results, organizations can enhance shared leadership by encouraging team members when teams foster interact team member and all of team members as leaders and to involve in shared, mutual leadership for extra-role behavior such as change-oriented OCB.

한국기업의 조직문화,"Recently, the fast growth and global success of Korean firms has become a hot topic of management research. Prior research has focused on vertical integration and operational efficiency in explaining this rapid rise, while others suggest that Korean Chaebuls have adopted digital technology-based innovations faster than other global firms such as SONY or Motorola in making their ascent to the global leader board of companies.
This study focuses on organizational culture in its investigation into Korean firms’ fast growth. In particular, this study attempts to explain the collective behavioral patterns and particular set of values common in Korean firms. Like an operating system for a computer that can run a variety of software programs, the authors view organizational culture as the core mechanism behind the various operational tools and instruments previously cited in the rapid rise of Korean Chaebuls. This study develops two conceptual models to describe Korean firm organizational culture: ‘Organizational cultural capabilities’ and ‘Shared values DNA structure’. One is a new conceptual model of organizational cultural capabilities that combines organizational culture theories, the Resource-based view, organizational competence, dynamic capabilities, and motivation theories. The second model is also a new conceptual model of Shared values DNA structure, and it combines organizational culture theories and a DNA model. These two conceptual models together provide a more powerful way to understand the culture-based growth engine mechanism behind Korean Chaebuls’ fast growth.
This study evaluates extant research on Korean Management style and relationships between organizational culture and organizational performance. Most of prior studies on the Korean corporate culture have confirmation bias to find some characteristics based on Korean traditional culture, such as Confucian values, familism, paternalism, collectivism, communalism, anthropocentric, assiduousness, obedience, whole-man education centric, Shinbaram, business field oriented leadership, externalism, short-term performance oriented, need for first class in the world, centralism, control oriented, stubbornness of seniors, bureaucracies, order-directed, only being a winner, conservatism, future-oriented etc.
In contrast, the work of Shin, Yoo Keun (1992) suggests a comprehensive list of characteristics of Korean corporate culture. Those are ‘Anthropocentric and paternalistic corporate culture’, ‘collectivism and moral obligation-based behaviors’, ‘hierarchical order centric behaviors’. Cho, Young Ho (1995) and Cho et al.(2014) suggested that ‘dynamic collectivism’ is a common characteristic factor among large Korean companies. Cho, Kim and Kim(2007) investigated whether Korean corporate culture has changed with the influence of western culture subsequent to the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. However, Shin (1992), Cho (1995), and Cho et al.(2014; 2007) did not try to clarify the mechanism of the Korean corporate culture contributing to the Chaebuls fast growth and global top player.
This study introduces a new model ‘Organizational cultural capabilities’ to explain the mechanism of the corporate culture contributing to the organizational growth. The Cultural capabilities is defined as behavioral patterns operated by fundamental and behavioral values set to be relevant to organizational performance. The Organizational cultural capabilities model includes seven styles(ways), such as goal setting style, working style, social competition style, organizational learning and change management style, managing people style, leadership style, boundary spanning, and inputs management style.
This study suggests that the mechanism used by Korean Chaebuls in their period of fast growth to be global top players can be described as ‘mobilizing the collective energies of the workforce to work for global excellence and top position’.",이춘우(Choonwoo Lee),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108195908
