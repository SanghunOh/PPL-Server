Currently, we do not feel much about the impact of robots on us, but in the near future, we are expected to feel the impact of robots on us as robots replace many of our human roles (Zhang, 2019). The introduction of the robot tax should be viewed from a broader perspective, not simply from a tax perspective. In other words, the introduction of the robot tax should be viewed in terms of social welfare, symbiosis, and sustainability. Therefore, the necessity and justification of introducing a robot tax will be explained, and a specific taxation system will be discussed.
[Methodology]Previous overseas studies on the introduction of the robot tax were investigated and presented, and a survey was conducted to understand what the public thought about the introduction of the robot tax. Based on this, problems and improvement plans for the introduction of the robot tax were derived.
[Findings]The results of the survey on the introduction of the robot tax conducted in this study are summarized as follows. There were many objections to the introduction of the robot tax. The biggest reasons for opposing the introduction of the robot tax were the ambiguity of the standard target and the increase in the tax burden. The biggest reasons in favor of the introduction of the robot tax were that it is for sustainable development from a long－term perspective and that it is used as funds necessary for reemployment of unemployed people due to robots.The suggestions for the taxation system for the introduction of the robot tax presented in this study are as follows. First, when robots replace human jobs, the tax base of robot tax is judged to have the most causal relationship with the purpose of introduction. In this study, when an intelligent artificial intelligence robot replaces a human job, the intelligent artificial intelligence robot sets a ‘virtual cost’ that treats like a human, not a tangible asset, and proposes corporate tax and robot tax calculations on the premise. Second, there may be an opinion that the robot tax rate should be set similarly to the tax rate according to the earned income tax base by applying the “virtual cost”, but considering that the purpose of the robot tax is to re－education and living subsidies for unemployed, the tax rate is sufficient. Therefore, it is not necessary to apply a progressive tax rate such as earned income tax, and it should be considered that a single tax rate is possible. Third, the robot tax should be used as a purpose tax for a specific purpose as a tax to be used as a resource for re－education and living assistance for those who lost their jobs after being replaced by robots. It is judged that it is desirable to stipulate it as an independent single law like the law. Fourth, in order to determine the person liable for robot tax, it is necessary to ultimately decide whether to grant a legal personality to the robot. This is because robots can become taxpayers only when their ability to own property is recognized according to the principle of “where there is income, there is tax.” Therefore, it is considered right to view the person liable for robot tax as an intelligent artificial intelligence robot, and to view a corporation that uses a robot more than a certain size as a taxpayer.
[Implications]In order to cope with the rapidly changing economic environment, this study summarized the opinions on the robot tax discussed so far, and investigated the opinions of the people on the robot tax and presented the results. The results of this study are expected to provide useful information in establishing a robot tax system in the future.",나형종,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268121
통화정책과 은행의 역할,"The novelty of the model is the embedding into a variant of the standard monetary general equilibrium framework of a micro-founded banking sector motivated by Goodfriend and McCallum (2007, GM henceforth), which allows for the presence of an external finance premium as a source of business fluctuations. A closed economy DSGE model is implemented quantitatively by applying the Bayesian likelihood approach, with calibration based on the Korean data. The presence of the external finance premium in the model turns out to matter quantitatively for the transmission of monetary policy, due to the potential for amplification of the real effects of expansionary monetary policy through a countercyclical banking ""accelerator."" Meanwhile the magnitude and persistence of the real effects are relatively weaker than those in Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and others, owing to the presence of a banking ""attenuator"" at work to attenuate the accelerator effect as in GM (2007). As another experiment, the desired monetary policy responses to a positive goods productivity shock and a negative collateral shock are compared to what is required when a central bank does not consider the effect of the presence of banking. The results reveal that, in order to stabilize modest deflation, monetary policy needs to be more accommodative in response to each shock than what is implied in the model without a banking sector. Finally, among the relative welfare performances of alternative monetary policy rules that include financial variables such as credit aggregates and asset prices as independent arguments in a standard Taylor rule (including output gap), we find that the central bank invariably attains a lower level of loss, and thereby stabilization gain, when responding positively to credit aggregates than it does when responding to other financial variables. The evidence provides renewed insight on the potential benefits of considering credit (monetary) aggregates in the interest rate policy actions.",김현의,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108349394
ESG 경영이 기업가치에 미치는 영향：벤처기업을 중심으로,"[Purpose]This study investigates whether ESG management adoption and performance affect the corporate value of venture companies. Although there is a consensus on the necessity and importance of ESG management being formed due to the growing interest in ESG, the industry is still skeptical about the economic value of ESG management and the empirical results of the economic value of ESG provided by the academia are mixed. In particular, venture companies appear to be slow to introduce ESG management due to limited resources and technology. Nevertheless, investors’ interest in ESG management can be more beneficial to venture companies as they have higher capital demand compared to other companies. Also, as venture companies are relatively start－ups, the benefits of ESG management such as employee motivation, employee bonding effect, and positive external image are expected to be more beneficial to them. Furthermore, the adoption of ESG management would help venture companies’ corporate governance. Thus, this study investigates whether ESG management adoption and performance are beneficial to venture companies.
[Methodology]To achieve the research purpose, this study conducted an empirical analysis using 12,880 company－year observations listed on the KOSPI and KOSDAQ markets from 2013 to 2020.
[Findings]The empirical results are summarized as follows. First, we find a positive interaction effect between ESG management adoption and venture company appointment on the firm value in t＋1, which supports our prediction that the venture companies’ ESG management adoption would have a positive impact on the firm value via attracting investment, employee motivation, and bonding of employees and securing a positive image. We obtained qualitatively similar results of the analysis using the ordinary least squares method(OLS) with the concurrent dependent variable, the OLS analysis based on the standard errors clustered at the firm level, and 2 SLS analysis which controls endogeneity to ensure robustness. Second, we find a positive interaction effect between the total ESG performance score, the score for each ESG area, and the dummy variable of venture companies on the firm value. These results suggest that not only the adoption of ESG management but also the higher ESG performance has a positive effect on the venture companies’ firm value.
[Implications]This study has the following academic and practical contributions. First, this study provides additional empirical evidence for the relationship between ESG and financial performance by focusing on the venture companies which can make the most of ESG management. Second, compared to other companies, it is relatively difficult for venture companies to introduce and operate ESG management. However, the empirical results in this study suggest that when venture companies introduce and operate ESG management well, it has positive effects on the firm value. Such findings provide practical implications that ESG management of venture companies ultimately has a positive effect on the firm value and venture companies can enjoy the positive effects of ESG management more than other companies. Third, the government bodies such as the Ministry of SMEs and Startups, which formulate policies related to venture companies and help them operate, are also encouraging venture companies to manage ESG through various policies. The results of this study have policy implications by providing economic benefits for the drafting and implementation of ESG－related policies and campaigns.",김정모,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268111

The recent introduction of ChatGPT accelerated these changes. This study examines the performance of ChatGPT on accounting cases and its implications for accounting education. ChatGPT generates correct answers and explanations for illustrating the core concepts of accounting and posting the journal entries upon the relatively simple transactions. However, ChatGPT has limited capacities on processing more complicated events and transactions. In accounting education, it becomes more important to evaluate student work more accurately particularly when the students submit the incomplete works that are easily accessible through ChatGPT.

ESG 활동과 기업가치의 상관관계와 인과관계,"ESG activities can enhance firm value by improving future cash flows and/or lowering discount rates. Although prior literature extensively examines the relationship between ESG activities and firm value, there is little evidence regarding whether and how ESG activities are associated with each component of the valuation model (i.e., future cash flows and discount rate). This paper fills this void by exploring the association between ESG activities and future cash flows (i.e., numerator) and the cost of capital (i.e., denominator) and assessing the popular but unsubstantiated claim on the causality. ESG activities can relate to firm value in several ways. First, ESG activities can enhance expected future cash flows by increasing sales and/or enlarging margins. If product market participants (consumers) prefer firms with superior ESG performance in their purchasing decisions, ESG activities increase sales revenues. ESG activities may also increase contributions from suppliers and employees, possibly resulting in better operating margins. Second, ESG activities reduce the cost of raising external capital if capital market participants (investors) believe that ESG activities lower overall firm risk. In this paper, we shed light on whether ESG activities indeed contribute to firm value via such channels. Specifically, we begin by confirming whether ESG activities are associated with factors related to future cash flows and the cost of capital. Going further, we investigate whether and to what extent the observed associations allow causal inferences. Our findings based on ESG scores of Korean listed companies from 2011 to 2019 are summarized as follows. First, we fail to confirm the cash flow channels. Using future sales and operating margins as a proxy for future cash flows, we find no evidence that ESG activities are significantly associated with such proxies. The results on the association between ESG activities and the cost of capital yield mixed evidence. We do find that ESG activities are positively associated with bond credit ratings (i.e., an ex ante proxy for debt financing costs), but such a relation does not exist for interest expenses (i.e., an ex post proxy). As for the cost of raising equity, we report that ESG activities are significantly and negatively related to two proxies for the cost of equity (i.e., E/P ratios as an ex ante measure and the implied cost of equity capital as an ex post measure), suggesting the potential link between ESG activities and firm value. More importantly, however, when we perform the Granger causality test, a methodology widely used to draw the causal inference, we do not find any evidence that the change in ESG activities induces the changes in future cash flows or the cost of capital. In sum, the widely accepted assertion that a firm can improve its enterprise value with ESG activities is not supported by our empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that stakeholders do not systematically incorporate ESG activities into their decision making, suggesting that recent claims for the value effect of ESG activities may be premature. We conduct a set of additional tests. First, we confirm that our findings do not change even in recent years when the importance of ESG activities draws greater attention from the public. Second, our results still hold when we use an alternative proxy for ESG activities to mitigate measurement error issues. Our evidence does not necessarily suggest that ESG activities do not deserve the attention. We admit some important caveats. First, ESG activities may not be deemed to financially perform if the primary purpose of a firm’s ESG activities is to improve the welfare of its stakeholders. Second, although this paper documents the average effect of ESG activities, we acknowledge that the effect of ESG on firm value can be contingent and hence salient for specific industries or firms with certain characteristics. Lastly, the internal validity of ESG scores...",김세희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430327
원가하방경직성은 주가급락에 영향을 미치는가?,"[Purpose] This study verified whether cost stickiness acts as a cause of lowering the stock price crash risk. If the company pursues a elastic cost strategy that reduces costs in order to maintain short－term profitability when sales are reduced, profits without future adjustment costs will be provided to the market. Accumulation of this information in the long run may pose a risk of a stock price crash. Therefore, this study verified the relationship between cost stickiness and stock price crash risk.
[Methodology] This study verified the relationship between cost stickiness and stock price crash risk As the independent variable, cost stickiness(CS) at the individual company level proposed by Homburg and Nasev (2008) was used. In addition, the conditional negative(－) skewness of stock returns and the degree of asymmetry in volatility of stock returns were analyzed using the stock price crash as a dependent variable.
[Findings] As a result, the greater the cost stickiness, the lower the stock price crash risk.
[Implications] This study suggests that the capital market should also take into account the market risks of stock price crash when managers decide their cost strategy.",홍영은,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99845935
외환위기 전후 금리·환율·주가 변동성에 관한 분석,"As regulations in financial markets have been substantially alleviated through financial liberalization and market opening following the currency crisis, asset prices such as interest rates, the exchange rate and stock prices may reflect diverse information more efficiently. But at the same time, the increased volatility of asset prices may give rise to financial unrest.
Based on a multivariate GARCH model, this paper studies volatility dynamics in bond, foreign exchange and stock markets and examines whether there exist volatility spillovers across the three markets in pre-crisis and post-crisis periods.
The results show that there are volatility spikes where volatility increases in the short term and promptly returns to the average level in all three markets. Average volatility levels are substantially higher after crisis than in the pre-crisis period. From the aspect of volatility spillover, a shock occurring in a particular market is found to be transmitted to other markets instantly in the post-crisis period when market linkages had been augmented due to financial liberalization and capital market opening. The stock market, especially, is found to play a leading role in inter-market volatility spillovers. This is attributable to the fact that most of the foreign capital for portfolio investment since the crisis has flowed into the stock market.",윤옥자,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40099602
준법지원인과 ESG 경영 간의 관련성 -준법지원인의 특성을 중심으로-,"The general counsel manages and supervises compliance activities within the company so that the company can conduct ethical management. As the importance of ESG management has grown, compliance management has become essential for transparent and effective governance. However, there are many firms that have not properly implemented general counsel system, despite the fact that listed firms with assets of more than 500 billion won have to implement it. This is possible because there are no penalty for firms that do not have general counsels within firms. Therefore, we believe that there can be a significant difference in ESG performance between companies that have general counsels and companies that have not.
Based on this, this study empirically analyzes how the existence of general counsels affect the ESG activities of KOSPI and KOSDAQ-listed companies with assets of more than 500 billion won that are mandatory to have general counsels using the disclosure data of annual reports. In addition, we conduct an empirical analysis on how the characteristics of general counsels are including expertise and supporting functions can affect ESG performance. As a result of the empirical analysis, when there is a general counsel in a firm, it has a significant positive (+) effect on the ESG grade. This implies that in order for a company to perform effective ESG management, the general counsel system must be preceded. This finding is consistent even after controlling possible endogeneity problem through conducting lagged independent variables method, 2SLS(Two-stage least squres), and so on. Furthermore, the expertise of general counsels measured by career and education background positively affects ESG performance, and supporting function of general counsels also has a positive effect on ESG grade of companies. These results suggest that the system of general counsels must be sophisticatedly established for more effective ESG management.
Despite the short disclosure period for general counsels, this study is considered to have a contribution in that it empirically examines the relationship between general counsels and ESG activities that were not covered in previous studies to our knowledge. Also, this paper has a practical implication in that it suggests through empirical analysis that general counsels can be an important factor in the performance of effective ESG activities. Finally, in terms of institutional improvement regarding the general counsel system, this study can be an informative reference material. In future studies, it is expected that more diverse studies will be conducted on general counsels.",오슬기,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268098
가상자산 발행 및 보유 기업의 회계 이슈1),"It is not just the global cryptoasset market but also the domestic cryptoasset market that has grown significantly over the years.
Nonetheless, accounting guidelines are by far limited. Moreover, the IASB recently decided not to add the issues of cryptoassets to its research agenda. The purpose of this study is not to present specific accounting standards for cryptoassets. Instead, this study presents issues that must be considered in developing accounting standards for cryptoassets, and discusses plausible accounting alternatives for those issues. More specifically, first, this study identifies typical transactions occurring in the process of issuing, trading, and holding cryptoassets. Second, this study reviews the existing accounting guidelines for cryptoassets as of September 2022. Third, this study finds potential accounting issues arising in the process of issuing, distributing and holding cryptoassets. Finally, this study discusses policy implications. This study finds that it is not just the limited accounting guidelines that create the inconsistencies in accounting for cryptoassets. More significant reason is that, due to insufficient regulation, not enough information is provided to determine the rights and obligations associated with cryptoassets. Many white papers have been issued without disclosing sufficient information. The detailed description on rights and obligation, even if it is provided, was not clear enough to determine whether they are legally enforceable or not due to lack of legal precedents.",현승임,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108766299
20대 대학생과 사회초년생의 재무스트레스 유형별 재무관리 소비자교육 요구도,"This study examined the characteristics of the financial stress factors, which are intended to prepare the society for the first time, and the characteristics of financial stress associated with different types of consumers by dividing them into deep categories.
For the purpose of this study, a preliminary survey was performed on university students and young adults. The questionnaire was amended or supplemented, and in October 2017, the survey was collected from online research institutes for a total of 300 samples.
The analysis showed that the overall financial stress level of the university students and young adults were 2.75 degrees on average, and the types of consumers were grouped according to the degree of financial stress as follows: High Stress Group, Loan Driven Stress Group, and Overall Low Stress Group.
Second, given the specific type of consumer based on the level of financial stress, the High Stress group was a highly educated group with more than a college degree and had the most outside impact on consumption in its university students and young adults with a job. The Loan Driven Stress Groups are those with the highest incomes and living costs, with a large number of people in their university students and young adults having jobs but a low rate of savings, while having a low outside impact on consumption. The Overall Low Stress Group was found to be the group with the youngest college students, lowest savings rate with respect to the average monthly income, and least number of people in the first year of society, while the parent's impact was high.
Third, the demand for financial management consumer education was high in the financially stressed group, and there were differences in the contents of the financial management consumer education demand.
Fourth, although the impact variables had a significant effect on the external impact factors associated with consumption on the financial management consumer education demand, these results highlighted the importance of the parent as a parent's nurturing and role model.
In particular, the financial stress caused by the imbalance between income and consumption in consumption-oriented lives will be met by rapidly changing social, economic, and technical approaches, considering the extended lifetime in an aging society.",김시월,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107590917
가계부채 문제에 관한 분석,"Using the recent survey of household finance in Korea, we found the following characteristics of household debt. Firstly, debt to income ratio seems to be sound in Korea at the household level although the share of seemingly risky households is around 5% and they are distributed evenly in all income groups. Secondly, most households have more financial assets than their own debt holdings but the risky households in their portfolio are also found in most income groups. Thirdly, based on some suggested standards to evaluate financial health of households, about 3% of households are estimated as risky in their debt level although more than 80% of households seems to be sound in their portfolio.
Lastly, we explore the determinants of debt and financial asset accumulation at household level using the household survey data. Given that debt and assets are both components of household's financial portfolio, we explore the degree of inter-dependence between households' assets and debts by jointly modelling theses two aspects of the portfolio with bivariate Tobit model. Our empirical findings support a negative inter-dependence between debts and financial assets holding although a high degree positive inter-dependence between debts and total assets including the housing assets.",유경원,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108585541
교환사채 회계처리에 관한 현황 조사연구,"The purpose of this study is to survey the accounting treatment and related disclosures of exchangeable bonds. Our sample consists of exchangeable bonds issued in 2011 to 2021 by firms adopting the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (K-IFRS). We document the following findings. First, for bonds that can be exchanged to third-party stocks, most firms classify exchangeable rights as derivative liabilities, as required by K-IFRS. Second, for bonds that can be exchanged to the issuers’ own equity instruments, exchangeable rights that do not meet the fixed-for-fixed requirement are classified inconsistently either as derivative liabilities or equity. Third, among firms that classify exchangeable rights as equity, a significant number of firms do not provide their rationale as the Financial Supervisory Services’ interpretation on the issue. Fourth, in the consolidated financial statements, subsidiaries’ stocks need to be considered as the issuers’ own equity instruments, but a large number of firms treat them as third-party stocks as in non-consolidated financial statements. We further examine the occurrence of exchange price adjustments and find that more than 80% of cases involve adjustments caused by the drop in prices of the exchanged stocks.

감사인지정제도가 실물이익조정에 미치는 영향,"The auditor designation system was adopted to complement free audit engagement system and to improve the reliability of the accounting information generated by the designated companies. The previous studies on the validity of the auditor designation system usually tested how discretionary accruals were changed during the period when the designated auditors performed auditing works. However, it should be taken into account whether manager can use both accruals and cash from operations as the sources of earnings management in order to confirm the effects of the system on earnings management. Thus this study divides the means of earnings management into discretionary accruals(DA) and real earnings management(RM) and specifies how the level of use of each earnings management of the designated company differs from the non-designated company, compared to the pre-designation period. My samples are 721 companies-years of audit recognition and 15,188 companies-non-designated companies among KOSPI and KOSDAQ listed firms in Korea from 2001 to 2010. The results of this study are as follows. Audit-designated firms have significantly lower DA levels than non-designated firms, and designated firms have significantly lower DA levels in the previous year. This result means that the use of DA is prevented by the designated auditor. On the other hand, the designated firms have abnormally lower operating cash flows (Ab_CFO) and the abnormal operating cash flows during the designated periods than the non-designated firms. This result suggests as a combination of the prevention by the designated auditor, as well as concerns about impairment of the future firm value. This study shows that the use of some items of RM by the designated auditor is suppressed. In light of the results of this study, it is expected that the expansion of the scope of designated auditors due to the recent revision of the External Audit Act and the 6 + 3 periodic designation system implemented from 2020 will enhance the reliability of accounting information.",손혁,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108536374
병원 최고경영자 교체가 수익성에 미치는 영향,"This study analyzed the effect of the change of hospital CEO on performance in the medical corporation. The CEO of hospital tend to be appointed for a short period rather than managerial CEO in the profit-making firms, and the CEO tend to be replaced frequently. Because the compensation and sanctions for hospital performance are weak during their tenure, it is not a heavy burden for the CEO to create profitability. In addition, Korean hospitals are non-profit medical corporations emphasized public health and constrained profitability creation activities. In this realistic situation, the relationship between the CEO turnover and the hospital performance needs to be considered from a different perspective from the general listed firms pursuing profit. For empirical analysis, this study got the 249 general hospitals with more than 100 beds that must comply with the Medical Institution Accounting Standards from 2017 to 2019, and made use of the financial data extracted by the Medical Accounting Committee under the Korean Accounting Association. The turnover of the hospital CEO was extracted by searching the website of each hospital and medical media. The alternative variables of profitability were measured in 4 items according to the characteristics of medical profit, 1) medical operating income on asset(OROA), 2) medical operating income to medical revenues(OIR), 3) net income to medical revenues(NIR), and 4) non-patient income to medical revenues(NPR). The results of the empirical analysis are as follows. Firstly, the change variable of the hospital CEO did not have a significant effect on the OROA, and the negative results were derived in the hospital that reported a surplus in the pre-CEO turnover year. This suggests that the new hospital CEO did not make any effort to utilize the resources efficiently. Secondly, the change of hospital CEO did not induce positive direction in OIR, This imply that though the medical operating revenues have increased as the increase health insurance earnings, medical expenses such as labor costs, material costs, and management costs have also increased. Thirdly, in the hospital reported a deficit pre-CEO turnover year, CEO showed a positive response to NIR. It seems to be a hint for CEO to feel a greater burden on the net income rather than medical operating income to represent the final performance. Fourthly, the change variable of hospital CEO was estimated to be a statistically significant positive(+) coefficient NPR, non-patient income to medical revenues. This suggests that the CEO perceived to be short-term managers are willing to rely on the profits from the use of fixed assets such as temporary funeral homes, parking lots, and hospital stores rather than creating profitability from medical activities, which are hospital-specific business during his short term of office. This study is meaningful as an initial study that verified CEO change and profitability at the hospital level, a non-profit corporation by expanding the prior researches for the commercial listed firms. In addition, this study imply that the new hospital CEO may be interested in classifying the profitability items to present their short-term performances.",김문태,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108491426
부정사건이 적발된 기업의 ESG 개선 활동과 언론의 보도 행태,"The fraud detection drives the loss of firm’s growth and reputation. Specifically, the market and stakeholders react negatively to fraud detection. So, future cash flows and costs of capital are negatively impacted by fraud detection. According to prior studies, firms try to restore firm value and reputation after detecting fraud.
At this point, We investigate whether the fraud detection firm improves ESG. And then we analyze media coverage regarding the ESG of the firm detected fraud event, such as accounting fraud, misappropriation and breach of trust. The sample period starts from 2015 and ends at 2020. Our findings are summarized as follows. First, we find that, ESG performance significantly increased after fraud detection. Second, the corporate governance improved after fraud detection. In short, to restore firm’s reputation after fraud detection, firms improve ESG activities, focusing on the corporate governance. Third, negative media coverage of ESG significantly increased after fraud detection. Finally, negative media coverage of social sector also increased. In other words, the media reports negatively on the ESG of fraud detection firm, and this trends also extends in not related to fraud detection sector, such as social.
In sum, We provide empirical results that firms improve ESG performance after the fraud detection, but negative media coverage of ESG trends to increases. Our study suggests that there is an ESG information gap between firms and the media. Therefore, investors need to increase understanding of asymmetric information. Our results recommend that ESG disclosure standards should be secured to allow investors to access such ESG information. Overall, our paper contributes to the empirical analysis of ESG activities and various media coverage patterns.",유하경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268074
투자－현금흐름 민감도에 따라 조세혜택이 투자에 미치는 영향은 달라지는가?,"The objective of this study is to examine whether the effect of tax benefits on investments depends on the sensitivity of investment－cash flow. With the recent increase in domestic companies’ internal reserves, the government has implemented various tax policies to outflow internal reserves. However, corporate investment spending is not affected solely by tax policies. It is a complex decision－making process that is affected not only by external factors such as external uncertainties, but also by the level of the firm’s internal funds. Therefore, while the government’s tax policy to promote a firm’s investment may increase internal cash flows, tax benefits will not necessarily lead to an increase in investment if the firm is less sensitive to investment of internal cash flows. Consequently, the effect of tax benefits on investments is expected to vary depending on the sensitivity of investment－cash flow.
Empirical analysis shows that tax benefits for firms with high sensitivity of investmentcash flows have a significantly positive impact on investment expenditure. We also find that firms with high investment－cash flow sensitivity have a greater impact on investment expenditure from tax benefits than those with low investment－cash flow sensitivity do. These results imply that the effectiveness of tax policy to promote corporate investment may vary depending on the firm’s sensitivity of investment－cash flow. Our results suggest that the government needs to consider various factors that affect the decision－making process of a firm’s investment expenditure when it establishes a tax policy to promote corporate investment.",홍영은,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108689931

It was also found that enhanced CSP led to the improvement of CFP. Second, there is no moderating effect of the CG in the relationship among(CSR, CSR－MCS), CSP, and CFP. But we found that there was mediating effect of CSP in the case of CG(B＋) group. Third, companies with high fitness in between CG and CSR－MCS reported the highest improvement in CSP and CFP.

회계정보 유용성 추세에 관한 연구,"In a paper entitled “The end of accounting and the path forward for investors and managers,” Lev & Gu (2016) argue that the usefulness of accounting information has declined from 90% in the 1950s to 50% in 2013 within the US stock market. Following the work of Lev & Gu, this study attempt to examine the trend in the usefulness of accounting information in the Korean setting. The research model seek to find out the trend in the usefulness of financial information variables such as net profit, and book value on the Korean stock market.
Through regression analysis, the trend in regression coefficient and explanatory power (R2) of the correlation between accounting profit and market capitalization of firms listed on the Korean stock exchange from 1980 to 2017 was analyzed.
The result of the study shows that the usefulness of net profit as accounting information on the Korean stock market has decreased significantly just as in the US, but the usefulness of firm book value has greatly increased since 2000. That is to say that investment decisions are based more on the size of firms rather than on the net profit of firms.
This study is significant because it made use of 38 years of firm data to investigate the aspects of financial information that are more useful in the investment decision making process in the Korean stock market. Again, another major significance of this study is that the results differs greatly from previous studies that examined the trend in the usefulness of accounting information in Korea about 15 years ago.",문태형,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101248559
도시바와 대우조선해양 회계부정과 사후처리 비교연구,"We conduct a comparative analysis of the causes, processes and post-treatments of accounting scandals at Toshiba and DSME. Toshiba in Japan and DSME in Korea were global top companies in the electronics and shipbuilding industries, respectively. The two companies suffered reputation damage because of the accounting scandals revealed in 2015. Both companies had incentives to manipulate profits because of the excessive emphasis on accounting profits and accumulated losses from new businesses. Both had ineffective monitoring systems due to the weak corporate governance. The accounting frauds were revealed by whistleblowers. Toshiba and DSME are investigated by regulatory bodies to identify the causes of the accounting frauds. CEOs and external auditors of Toshiba are not sentenced to imprisonment, while those of DSME are sentenced to imprisonment. In addition, the laws related to accounting are revised to improve accounting transparency in Korea. This study suggests that (1) the excessive emphasis on a target profit linked to the compensation contract can cause accounting frauds, (2) the existence of effective anti-fraud measures and the appointment of outside board-of-directors with expertise are needed to prevent accounting frauds, and (3) the corporate culture where juniors can challenge their superiors' decisions and the tone at the top management are important in preventing accounting frauds.",권수영,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107896084
개정 회계기준 관련 회계오류의 발생과 내부통제 및 외부감사인 기능의 관련,"Korea Accounting Standards Board(KASB) published the revised SKAS No. 15, Investments in Associates, and KAI Opinion 06-2, Deferred Income Taxes on Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Interests in Joint Ventures, in March and February 2008, respectively, saying that these changes are to have the standards for equity-method accounting under Korean GAAP consistent with the “one-line consolidation” concept in accounting theory. Since these changes are related to the complicated accounting of equity-method investments and deferred income taxes, and are announced in the timing of the first quarter book closing process, it was not easy for the Korean companies to properly understand the standard changes and to correctly and timelily report the change effects in the first quarter financial reporting. We find that, out of 259 companies having reported accounting changes in the second quarter of 2008, 164 companies or 63% restated or corrected the first quarter accounting change disclosures; this represents that large number of Korean public companies have failed to properly and timelily report the accounting changes in the first quarter 2008 financial reporting.
Quality of accounting information is improved through two processes by which accounting errors are detected and corrected: (i) the internal financial statement preparation process and (ii) the external assurance process. i.e. accounting errors could be identified and corrected by both of financial statement preparation and assurance processes. (The “assurance process” represent the function that external auditors provide assurance on the financial statements by expressing (audit or review) opinions, in the material respects, which improves the quality of accounting information in the information communication process.) The former is affected by the company's internal control effectiveness such as its self-closing capability and external regulation on the company's internal control system. The latter is affected by external assurance (audit or review) function's involvement. The accounting errors included in the final reporting in the first quarter of 2008 of Korean public companies represents that such company's and auditors' processes failed to detect them before finalization of filing of quarterly reports.
This study investigates whether the errors in responding to accounting standard changes are associated with the error firm's internal control effectiveness or external auditor function availability. Under the context of the risk model perspectives discussed above, and based on the previous researches, hypotheses for error firm characteristics have been established as follows. First, internal control effectiveness would be associated with less accounting errors(larger size [or corporate governance] and more stringent external regulations on the company's internal control [i.e. general internal control standards vs. small-medium size company internal control standards] were used as the proxy of internal control effectiveness). Second, external auditor's review would decrease accounting errors. For testing of this hypothesis, it was assumed that the error would decrease if the first quarter financial statement disclosure was subject to the external auditor's reviews.
The results of this study generally show that the internal control effectiveness and the external auditor's review have significant negative relationship with accounting errors, and seriousness of the errors as well. These findings are generally consistent with the hypothesis of this study and provide certain practical implications for improvement of company's competency to adopt complicated accounting standards. Certain recommendations could be derived from the implications; which include (i) extension of mandatory external review for quarterly reports, (ii) private accountants for IFRS reporting by large-sized companies or financial institutions, (iii) improvement of professional capability of firms and accounting firms, and (iv) commitment by participating parties (reporting companies, auditors and accounting firms, and regulators) to adhere to the global level accounting practice
This study has contributions by identifying control weakness firms related to company's self-closing capability and by finding the effects of the company's internal control and external auditor's involvement (review function) to properly apply the complicated accounting standards, as revised, to their own financial reporting through the Korean companies' experiences of errors in reporting accounting standard change effects in the first quarter of 2008. Such control weaknesses or accounting errors under the context of company's capability of proper accounting and financial statement preparation have never been identified by the previous researches. Also, certain practical implications are suggested regarding how to support companies' own capability to adopt new accounting standards; it would have practical implications for Korean companies, auditors and regulators to prepare for initial adoption of IFRS in 2011.",이재은,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108585542
전환사채 발행자의 회계처리와 주가 변화에 따른 재무적 영향: 전환권 분류를 중심으로,"Recently, many Korean convertible bond issuers reported large valuation losses on derivatives after their stock price increased, leading to significant increases in leverage and, for some extreme cases, negative net assets. To understand this counterintuitive phenomenon in which good news to a company (i.e., stock price increases) lead to the deterioration of financial conditions, this study provides theoretical explanations on the accounting treatments for convertible bonds. Specifically, the study explains that embedded conversion rights are classified as equity (liabilities) when convertible bonds are issued without (with) a refixing clause and how this classification of the conversion rights affects the initial measurement and subsequent valuation of conversion rights. Relatedly, this study analyzes how the classification of conversion rights affects the convertible-bond issuers’ future cash outflows, debt-to-equity ratios, and level of retained earnings, and show that information users can infer the probability of conversion from the issuers’ financial statements. Lastly, the study applies the aforementioned theoretical discussions to a real case of convertible bond issuance (Kyung Nam Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.). This study enhances the understanding of convertible bonds and embedded derivatives by bridging the gap between accounting textbooks that mainly introduce convertible bonds with fixed conversion ratios and practices that more frequently trade convertible bonds with a refixing clause.",김영준,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99926602
LG화학의 LG에너지솔루션 분할설립과 ESG경영에 대한 회계적 고찰,"[Purpose]This study analyzes the accounting treatment for the corporate spin－off through a case analysis, and examines the relationship between the corporate spin－off and ESG management. Specifically, we study the accounting treatment for the establishment of LG Energy Solutions by LG Chem in December 2020, and examine the impact of the spin－off decision on the ESG management of LG Chem and LG Energy Solutions.
[Methodology]We examine the accounting treatment on the spin－off in accordance with the K－IFRS and analyze the detailed accounting process through the audit report of LG Chem and LG Energy Solutions. In addition, by comparing the ESG ratings of LG Chem and LG Energy Solutions with companies in the same industry, we review the relationship between spin－off and ESG management.
[Findings]LG Chem operates the petrochemical business, battery business, advanced materials business, and life science business. Among them, the petrochemical business and battery business account for more than 80% of total revenue and net assets. LG Chem has received relatively lower grades than its competitors in the environment sector of ESG rating. This implies the possibility of suffering losses in the ESG rating due to the petrochemical business, despite the possibility of receiving better rating in the battery business. In order to improve the ESG rating, LG Chem needs to increase the year－on－year improvement rate of each indicator.
[Implications]The case analysis of this study is expected to contribute to accounting education by examining the accounting treatment of the corporate spin－off and analyzing the case of LG Chem in detail. In addition, it is meaningful that it has expanded previous research by anlyzing the relation between the corporate spin－off and ESG management which is a non－financial factor.",심준용,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107043909
사회초년생의 은퇴준비 연구 -은퇴준비 역량과 은퇴준비 영역별 인식 및 실태를 중심으로-,"This study aimed to identify the awareness, capability, and actual status of the retirement preparation among young adults. The study was conducted on 540 young adults aged between 20 to 30 years who had been working for 5 years or less and had a regular monthly income. The results of the study showed that young adults were aware of the need for retirement preparation in all areas (leisure, work, social interaction, nest, ballast, finance, health), but they placed a higher priority on areas that were related to financial preparation for retirement. The levels of capabilities required for retirement preparation were knowledge, skill, and attitude in that increasing order. The level of preparation for retirement in terms of actual status was higher in the areas of health and finance. The study also found that women, participants with lower levels of education, and those with lower incomes had a higher level of awareness on the importance of preparing for retirement, but had lower level of skills required for the same and status. The results of the analysis of the relationship between the actual status of retirement preparation in different areas among young adults and their capability and awareness showed that knowledge related to preparation for retirement does not have a direct impact on the actual status of preparation. However, it has an impact on the awareness of the importance or a full mediation effect.
Hence, it is necessary to improve their awareness on retirement preparation. The areas where the full mediation effect of retirement preparation knowledge through the awareness of the importance of retirement preparation was statistically significant were the areas of finance and health. Retirement preparation knowledge has an impact on awareness. However, the retirement preparation attitude does not have an impact on awareness. On the other hand, retirement preparation knowledge does not have an impact on actual status. However, retirement preparation attitude and skill often have an impact on the actual status. Therefore, it was confirmed that the capability, knowledge, attitude, and skill for retirement preparation should be integrated into the actual status of retirement preparation. This suggests that a variety of effective options for retirement preparation should be provided to young adults according to the perceived gaps in the necessary retirement preparation areas.",조소현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268029
기업의 ESG 등급이 발생액 이익조정 및 실물 이익조정에 미치는 영향,"[Purpose]This study examined the relationship between a company’s ESG grade and earning management(accrual earning management and real earning management) level. This paper also conducted an empirical analysis on the relationship between the level of corporate earning management and detailed grades such as environmental, social activity, and governance grades among ESG grades as well as ESG total grades.
[Methodology]The sample period of this study was from 2011 to 2021, and the sample targets were those companies that disclosed ESG ratings by the Korea ESG Standards Institute among KOSPI companies. In addition, corporate financial data used in this study were collected using KIS－VALUE provided by NICE Credit Rating. In this paper, the effect of a company’s ESG rating on accrual earning management and real earning management behavior was verified through a regression analysis model.
[Findings]As a result of the study, first, the higher the ESG rating of a company, the lower the level of accrual earning management. When verified using the accrual earning management variable used in Dechow et al. (1995) and the accrual earning management variable used in Kothari et al. (2005), the same results were derived. Second, the higher the ESG rating of a company, the lower the level of real earning management overall. However, different results were derived for each detailed activity of real earning management. In the case of abnormal operating cash flow, the higher the ESG total grade, environmental grade, and social activity grade, excluding the corporate governance grade, the higher the level of real earning management using abnormal operating cash flow. In the case of abnormal manufacturing cost, the higher the environmental, social activity, and governance grades, which are all the lower grades as well as ESG’s total grade, the lower the level of real earning management using abnormal manufacturing cost. In the case of abnormal discretionary costs, the level of real profit adjustment using abnormal discretionary costs was found to be low only when the corporate governance rating was high, and the remaining ESG total, environmental, and social activity grades and abnormal discretionary costs were not significantly related.
[Implications]First, the research results of this paper provide useful information that companies that think about the environment, have social responsibility, and have transparent governance structures distort facts and generally engage in less unethical earning management. Second, in the case of real earning management, it can be seen that there is a different relationship with ESG ratings by abnormal operating cash flow, abnormal manufacturing cost, and abnormal discretionary cost, suggesting that a company’s ESG rating can be an indicator to infer the level of real earning management. Third, at a time when interest in ESG is rising, the empirical analysis results of this paper are expected to contribute to sound corporate activities and cultural settlement by reminding managers of the importance of ESG activities.",강경구,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107867718
이중과세금지원칙의 의미와 한계,"Double taxation principle has been used when looking through unconstitutionality and legal deficiency in research papers. There are a few scholars regarding prohibiting double taxation as distinct principle without reasonable doubt. I guess that this phenomenon would come partially or wholly from decisions by the Consitutional Court which has used double taxation principle obviously or looked like assuming that underlying principle.
However, the concept of double taxation principle is not obvious or concrete. Therefore, as it happens, decisions by the Constitutional Court are not logically consistent or are contradicted each other. Furthermore, under no section in Consitutional Law prohibiting double taxation clearly, there are questions, (1) where double taxation principle is from in Consitutional Law, viz. the interpretation problem, (2) whether extracting double taxation principle from Constitutional Law is right or not. Why should be double taxation prohibited? What problems would happen if not double taxation prohibited? Unfortunately, it is impossible to find the adequate answers by decisions by the Constitutional Court and other research papers that affirm the double taxation principle. The thought that double taxation should be prohibited because of double taxation could not be persuasive.
Double taxation, rather, is a common phenomenon in Korean tax law system and it could not be totally removed under current tax law system. In addition, this phenomenon is not peculiar to Korean tax law system.
The goal of this paper proves that the double taxation principle could not be a principle in the Constitution Law and in interpretation and application of tax laws.",김현동,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60267256
원칙중심 회계기준 어떻게 실행할 것인가? - 삼성바이오로직스 사례에 대한 토론,"In 2012, Samsung Biologics founded Samsung Bioepis. At the end of 2015, since Bioepis was converted from a consolidated subsidiary into an equity-method affiliate, the equity shares of Bioepis held by Samsung Biologics were evaluated at their fair market value. In this regard, there were differences in the perspectives between Samsung Biologics and the regulator. This disparity may be resulted from the process of adopting principle-based accounting standards under a rule-based legal system.
This study discusses and finds the way how to apply “International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)”, a principle-based accounting standards, to Korea through the case of Samsung Biologics. In particular, this study analyzes the process of this case over time and summarizes different stances on this case among firm, regulators, and other related parties. Therefore, this study has tried to deal with the topics of discussion in terms of current accounting system and standards (i.e., principle-based) in various aspects. Since this issue is closely related to the four main characteristics of IFRS, discussing this issue will be important and meaningful step in the application of principle-based accounting standards. Specifically, this study discusses four major topics in terms of “consolidated accounting”, “fair value accounting”, “principle-based accounting”, and “interpretation of and support for accounting standards.” It may also be a good example of the discussion of applying principle-based accounting in classes.",조중희,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108361282
온실가스 배출권 재무공시 현황 및 시사점,"[Purpose] This study aims at providing the implications and the improvements of the financial disclosure of the carbon emissions and the carbon credits.
[Methodology] This paper reviews the current financial disclosure of the companies which have large quantities of carbon emissions from accounting users’ perspectives.
This study covers financial disclosures, including financial statements and their notes on their annual and quarterly reports.
[Findings] This paper documents the gaps between the K－GAAP and the current disclosure practice. There is inconsistency between the carbon credits and carbon liabilities. There are wide deviations across companies with respect to the unit price of carbon credit when companies estimate the amounts of their carbon liabilities.
The paper also proposes additional disclosure for the carbon liabilities and cost flow assumptions, etc.
[Implications] Differentiated from the previous literature that is focused on quantitative analysis, this paper reviews the quality of the carbon related disclosures.
This study provides proposals that can enhance the usefulness of carbon disclosure to the accounting information users.",윤양인,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60268046
회계투명성이 기업의 성과에 미치는 영향,"[Purpose] The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of accounting transparency in Korea’s corporate performances.
[Methodology] This study measures accounting transparency of Korean corporations, and examines the relationship between corporate－level management performances and accounting transparencies.
[Findings] Analysis results showed that accounting transparency increases the performance of companies. Specifically, better accounting transparency leads to better operating profit ratio, total sales and per capita sales. This seems to be because companies with better accounting transparency ultimately improve corporate performance since they have less information asymmetry which leads to lower capital costs from outside stakeholders including investors and also mitigate decision－making risks which could be caused by misinformation for internal stakeholders such as management.
In particular, the fact that per capita sales, which is closely related to productivity of a company, have a positive relationship with the firm’s accounting transparency suggests that better transparency of an entity increases the efficiency of resource allocation within the company. In other words, management can use reliable and timely accounting information to enhance the efficiency of corporate management.
[Policy Implications] The finding of this study, that accounting transparency increases the performance of enterprises, suggests that various policy efforts to improve accounting transparency, such as KARA(Korea’s Accounting and Audit Reform Act), may also affect the firm’s competitiveness. In particular, in order for KARA tasks such as Periodic Mandatory Designation for listed companies and the implementation of Standard Audit Hours to be settled down successfully, it is believed that the government, the accounting industry, academia and corporations should work together in consensus of the need for accounting transparency.",이찬우,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108405012
