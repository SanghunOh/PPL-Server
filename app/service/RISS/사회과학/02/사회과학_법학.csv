Beyond the level where conventional artificial intelligence was merely a means of assisting human decision-making or action, it has reached a stage where it analyzes vast amounts of data to identify problems on its own, create optimal answers, and even self-examine errors. A representative example is the Chat GPT service. Recently, however, copyright infringement disputes have been reported in this regard. For example, in January 2023, Getty Images filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Stability AI, the developer of 'Stable Diffusion', and in April 2023, Twitter CEO Elon Musk also announced its intention to file a copyright infringement lawsuit against Microsoft (MS). In this regard, in this paper, first, as an issue derived from data use, chat GPT does not disclose how to learn data, so it is difficult to confirm whether scrolling and scraping are prohibited information has been collected, and chat GPT service is fair. It was pointed out that there are elements that are difficult to see as use, that the scope of TDM exemption is different for each country, and that TDM exemption regulations have not yet been introduced in Korea. Then, as a way to determine and protect copyright infringement of chat GPT products, first, in relation to authors and rights attribution, the contribution of artificial intelligence and humans to creation is divided and marked by stages (by year), and rights attribution must be different accordingly, second, in relation to the judgment of substantial similarity, refer to the criteria for functional works, but in the case of artificial intelligence products, there is a limit to determining whether or not copyright infringement is caused only by human feelings, so plagiarism verification or copyright infringement prevention programs must be developed and applied. Third, In relation to copyright protection institutions, it is appropriate to stipulate the protection period of artificial intelligence products at 5 years, but a two-dimensional approach must be taken so as not to reduce the incentive for human creation. Fourth, in relation to civil and criminal legal responsibilities, the Product Liability Act Referring to the provisions of the Senate Civil Act, it was proposed that artificial intelligence developers and users jointly and jointly take responsibility in principle, but that responsibilities should be assigned differentially depending on whether there was a violation of the duty of care or negligence. Based on the contents examined in this paper, it is necessary to actively seek rational and systematic ways to regulate generative artificial intelligence services.",정윤경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108667164
일본의 원전 오염수 방류 결정에 대한 문제점과 해결방안 연구,"On April 13, 2021, the Japanese government unilaterally decided to discharge nuclear polluted water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean. The ocean discharge of nuclear polluted water from nuclear power plants in Japan not only causes radioactive contamination of the waters around Fukushima and the coastal marine environment, but also causes damage by inflow of radioactivity to the coasts of Korea and the entire Pacific Ocean, and serious problems such as changes in the marine ecosystem will also occur.
Various countermeasures are being considered in response to Japan's decision to discharge nuclear polluted water from nuclear power plants, and it is possible to file a lawsuit with the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea(ITLOS) centering on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea(UNCLOS), and to request for provisional measures if there is a possibility of serious damage and the urgency of the situation.
This paper examine the problems of Japan's decision to discharge nuclear polluted water from nuclear power plants, review the meaning and main characteristics of international environmental disputes caused by marine environmental pollution, and review UNCLOS related regulations and precedents in preparation for litigation to draw implications.
In order to solve the problem at the time when the discharge of nuclear polluted water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan is imminent, the first priority is to seek a judicial solution to file an ITLOS complaint and apply for provisional measures based on the UNCLOS, and at the same time, a joint cooperation system between Korea and Japan or the International community would like to suggest effective solutions such as diplomatic(non-judicial) solutions through.",강석주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108531818
촉법소년의 연령 하향,"The public's shock and concern are increasing very much about a series of juvenile delinquencies that have occurred recently. A juvenile’s mental immaturity in comparison with physical development leads to lacking emotional control, being apt to commit impulsive crimes, and showing a tendency to be easily tempted by the surroundings.
A reason that the issue of lowering the age of law-intruding juveniles among young offenders continues to emerge is because of a rapid rise in law-intruding juveniles. In accordance with the statistics by the National Police Agency and by the court of law, the law-intruding juveniles have been increasing every year for the last five years. Most of the law-intruding juveniles were 13 years old. They were analyzed to be 72.7% of the total law-intruding juveniles.
Hence, the discussions about the age of law-intruding juveniles are being made. The National Assembly is also being proposed the amendments of the Juvenile Law and Criminal Law. Even the government came forward the preparatory work of lowering the age of law-intruding juveniles. The downgrade in the age of law-intruding juveniles is what reduces its scope by dropping the age limit for the criminal minors from 14 to 12.
However, whether the lower limit of criminal sanctions, which may have an absolute influence upon juveniles’ life, will be set at what age corresponds to an area where the the self-responsibility principle and the protectionism are mixed. There is also a criticism as saying that the ideology of protectionism should be applied even to the criminal procedure as well as to the juvenile protection procedure.
Nevertheless, if juveniles who committed a violent crime are not punished properly just because of being young, this could be rather aiding and abetting a crime. It might be the result of driving them down a worse path. Moreover, what raises the alarm by strictly enforcing the standard of the law against criminals who repeatedly commit violent crimes by exploiting the fact that they are juvenile perpetrators could be a way to reduce a crime even a little.
It will be below examined the low age pattern and the ferocity phenomenon in law-intruding juveniles, the problem about which the law-intruding juveniles themselves are unconscious or abuse the criminality, and the issue of criteria for judging the liability incompetence. And after looking into the revised bill that is being proposed by the National Assembly, there will be a consideration on the issues that will need to be contemplated when coming to lower the age of law-intruding juveniles.
The human rights of the perpetrators are important as well. But the law should protect the victim before that. A crime is thought to be likely declined given coming to be settled as the social norm the perception that committing a crime leads to being punished reasonably regardless of age.",점승헌,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108262012
인공지능(AI) 생성물과 저작권 문제,"The development of ""generative AI"" technologies has significantly stimulated academic research in recent years, especially in the area of legal implications. In particular, copyright issues have been discussed more than other intellectual property rights, largely due to the widespread use of pre-existing works to train these advanced AI models.
The primary copyright issues related to generative AI include whether an AI-generated output can be copyrighted, what rights can be granted if copyrightability is denied, who the rights holder might be in such circumstances, and issues of copyright infringement and liability. This article delves into these three issues across separate chapters.
First, in terms of authorship, Korean copyright law defines a ""copyrighted work"" as ""a creative expression of human thought or feeling. This implies that authorship is not extended to non-human creators.
Second, it was confirmed that this position is consistent with international law and case law. Furthermore, if authorship is denied, the discussion explored whether AI-generated output should remain in the public domain or be protected by rights other than copyright. However, if any rights are not granted to AI-generated outputs, it would be challenging to address the unauthorized use of these outputs in the secondary market. Moreover, the absence of rights could reduce the incentive to create and use such outputs. From this perspective, I argue that AI-generated outputs should be afforded legal protection through intellectual property rights. Accordingly, I have suggested that it is appropriate to grant neighboring rights. This is consistent with the legislative intent behind neighboring rights, which is to protect the act of making works available to the public. Moreover, because neighboring rights are less exclusive than copyright and have a limited scope, they are proposed as the appropriate rights to grant. This approach could facilitate the use of AI-generated works.
The third issue concerns copyright infringement and liability with respect to AI-generated outputs. This article has identified two primary types of copyright infringement in generative AI: 'input-phase infringement,' which occurs during the process of feeding and training an AI model, and 'output-phase infringement,' which occurs during the creation and secondary use of outputs that bear substantial similarity to the original work. A key question is who is liable for infringement at each phase, so this article has also examined this issue.",김경숙,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739570

일본의 후쿠시마 방사능 오염수 해양방류에 대한 런던의정서의 적용 검토,"The Japanese Government decided to discharge Fukushima Radioactive Water into the Pacific Ocean by the pipeline facilities starting from Spring 2023. The Governmen of the Republic of Korea expressed concern regarding the decision on the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the sea, maintaining that the issue should be discussed in London Convention/London Protocol meetings. In 2020 LC/CP meetings, the republic of Korea, in commenting on the progress report by the London Protocol Compliance Group, suggested that such activities could represent an issue of non-compliance of the obligation under Article 2 of the London Protocol. The Republic of Korea suggested that in line with a precautionary approach, it is necessary to have discussions in LC/LP meetings to find appropriate plans for the disposal of radioactive wastes through the sharing of information.
The Government of Japan was concerned about the Republic of Korea’s proposal to discuss discharges from land-based facilities in LC/LP meetings, since it has grave implications of broadening the scope of the LC/LP regulations to include the discharges of wastes and other matter from land-based facilities, which is clearly not subject to the regulations of the LC/LP.
In 2021, the governing bodies of LC/LP requested the Secretariat (IMO) to provide legal advice on the issue of the scope of the LC/LP, in particular in relation to discharges from land-based facilities, to the next meeting of the governing bodies in 2022. Japan objected the proposal to seek legal advice on the issue of the scope of the LC/LP. The Republic of Korea stated that the legal advice should focus specifically on the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant.
This article reviews the applicability of the London Protocol to the discharge of Fukushima Radioactive Water into the sea. It argues the discharge of radioactive water from sea tunnel into the sea around 1 km from the seashore may constitute “dumping” under the London Protocol since it may be “any deliberate disposal into the sea of wastes or other matter from other man-made structures at sea” under Article 1. 4.1.1 of the London Protocol.
Moreover, it points out that there is dispute settlement mechanism under the London Protocol, namely, Article 16 of the London Protocol and the Annex 3 of the London Protocol. In particular, the Annex 3 of the London Protocol provides “Arbitral Procedure”.",김영석,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108294379
수술실 CCTV 설치 및 운영에 대한 고찰,"Recently, medical accidents related to surgical procedures have increased. In addition, the media reported that some of these accidents were involved in health crimes. Patient-advocate groups have called for mandatory establishment and management of CCTV in operating rooms. There is a lot of discussion among the interested parties, so it is necessary to review the relevant laws and regulations. The purpose of this study is to identify the characteristics of CCTV in operating rooms and to review legislations related to establishment and management of the CCTV in operating rooms.
Medical institutions use CCTV for management of facilities and patient safety and install it in operating rooms optionally.
The Constitution guarantees the privacy and the privacy of correspondence of every citizen, but it can be limited by the law for public welfare. Currently, however, there is no existing law about establishment and management of the CCTV in operating rooms and it can be defect of legal system.
Under the current legislations, it is likely that the Self-determination can be violated due to the characteristic of healthcare provider when CCTV is mandatorily installed in operating room. In addition, the regulations on access and leakage of confidential information known by operator are insufficient. So that, the safety of the visual data might be threatened. Furthermore, unless the period and the place of storage of the visual data are clearly defined, it is highly unlikely to meet the original purpose of patient safety and prevention of medical accidents.
This study is meaningful as there is few previous study on this topic although the need for legal review about this is growing and several bills are being proposed. It is expected that the results of this study can be utilized as basic data for enactment or amendment of the laws and regulations about establishment and management of CCTV in operating rooms.",김민지,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106258426
AI 자동 생성작품에 대한 저작권 부여 한계와 대안적 보호방법론,"With the development of generative artificial intelligence technology, AI is emerging as a complete creative subject throughout the creative process. Therefore, in this paper, the concept of artificial intelligence-generated works (AGW) with minimal human intervention among AI-related creations is clearly defined through comparison with adjacent concepts, and then comprehensively summarizes the limitations of AGW protection in the interpretation of the current copyright law, and the international trend and overseas trends are briefly checked. Second, if it is difficult to protect by granting copyrights to AGW, first, consider how to leave it as a public domain, but also review the theoretical grounds for the theory of putting public domain and specific implementation methods thereof. Furthermore, we examine the limitations and problems of the theory of public domains, such as concerns about the possibility of abuse and false registration, as well as alternative solutions, to see what problems neglecting AGW, which is difficult to distinguish from human creation, can cause.
Third, as a concrete protection methodology that has been discussed as an alternative solution, we look at the unification/dualization method and the method of subsuming within the copyright normative system or enacting a special law. In either way, the protection of AGW is premised on discriminatory protection, so this paper focuses on the theory of so-called ‘thin copyright protection’ and examines the key points that need to be reviewed in case of discriminatory protection.",김원오,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108652387

Research on juvenile drug crimes has argued that drug addiction treatment and rehabilitation program are essential to solve the problem. The current study reviews U.S. law, system, and programs related to juvenile drug crimes: Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, Juvenile Drug Treatment Courts, Teens & Young Adult Rehab Facility, Inpatient Alcohol and Drug Rehab Program, Outpatient Drug and Alcohol Rehab Program, and Family Programs and Support and Recovery Support. Based on the review on U.S. system, five policy implications are presented to address juvenile drug crimes. First, Juvenile Act should include specific clause regarding treatment programs and system.

First, there is a question whether artificial intelligence generated works can be copyrightable. Because artificial intelligence has no ideas or emotions, even if it is created by autonomous artificial intelligence, there arises a question of whether it can not be protected under the definition of Article 2 of the current copyright law. If so, then there is a issue about whether there are any protection measures for the producer who developed and invested for such autonomously strong artificial intelligence. In the end, under the current copyright law, It is doubtful whether artificial intelligence’s autonomously created creations can be construed as an object that can not be protected. If so, the challenge is how to bridge the gap between legislative deficiencies and the need for protection. In this article, we will look at several legal issues that can be predicted, especially focused on our copyright law, in conjunction with the unpredictable growth rate of artificial intelligence (AI) which associated Big Data. Unlike traditional works of art whose works are protected by the Copyright Act, our available current copyright regimes can’t protect the autonomously strong artificial intelligence generated works.

It has been a long time to discuss whether AI products are authoritative, but it was difficult to find specific cases. Now, the issue of generative AI is becoming realistic. The results of AI-led production are denied the copyright because there is no human creative contribution. This is because works are creative expressions of human thoughts and emotions, and the creator must be a person. The U.S. Copyright Office canceled the copyright registration of <Zarya at Dawn>, which was produced with generative AI. The implication of this case is that AI cannot be an author.

생성형 AI의 개발 및 이용에 관한 규제의 필요성 - 대규모 언어모델에 기반한 대화형 인공지능 서비스(LLMs AI)를 중심으로 -,"Since entering the era of the 4th industrial revolution, AI has made light-speed development, and now artificial intelligence has an influence on society as a whole. As competition for the development of generative AI intensifies due to the short-term spread of Chat GPT-3, which was released in 2022, artificial intelligence is showing technology that surpasses humans even in the realm of creation that was considered to be human-only. However, since it is as complex and involves various social problems as advanced technologies, this study analyzed the current status of generative AI, especially AI based on large language models specialized in conversation or search engines, focusing on text, to point out the problem and seek solutions.
LLMs AI relies on large amounts of data, resulting in learning data problems such as data bias, false information, misuse of information, and data hallucinations, illegal problems such as personal information and copyright infringement, crime use, and changes in the digital divide and job market. To this end, it is necessary to enforce compliance with technical ethics centered on basic human rights and responsible self-supervision in future technology development, and strengthen public relations, education, and supervision of AI ethics at the pan-government level. Furthermore, it proposes strong direct regulatory provisions that give responsibility by reviewing personal information, copyright, content-related laws, and basic AI laws so that AI, developers, and users, all of them, can develop, create, and use responsibly.

청소년의 마약류 등 유해약물남용에 대한 범죄실태와 대처방안,"Korean society today has been influenced by internationalization and liberalization, leading to more youths studying overseas, more personal exchanges by the general public, an increase in foreigners living in Korea and the direct purchasing of goods from overseas sources due to developments in the Internet and SNS media. These changes have also led to a sharp increase in new forms of illegal drugs spreading throughout the society. In response, policy directions and investigations to crackdown on drugs and other toxic substances are entering a new phase. Within this situation, youths are at particular risk as they are still in the process of physical and mental development. Youth exposure to harmful substances such as drugs, which accompany a high risk of hidden crimes, poses not only a danger for the individuals themselves, but also for the future of the nation, and as such it is important to focus on preventing these youths from being exposed to harmful substances in the first place, and find solutions to prevent recurring offenses when a youth has already experienced and/or become addicted to such substances. In this paper, we propose to extend the currently limited education on smoking and drinking, on which school programs mainly concentrate, to include education to prevent youths from using hallucinogenic substances and help them cope with these dangers. In addition, we propose cooperating with competent agencies to operate a system that works in real time, automatically monitoring and deleting/blocking information that allows youths to purchase and manufacture hallucinogenic substances. We also believe it will be necessary to establish a single drug control agency that can effectively curtail the rise of drug and substance addiction criminals, including but not limited to juvenile offenders, by conducting analytical follow-up investigations of these crimes.",이정혁,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105935819

대규모 전세사기(빌라왕)에 대한 공법적 규제방안,"Since the second half of last year, large-scale Jeonse lease fraud cases called ""Villa King"" and ""Villa God"" have been revealed one after another. The term ""rental fraud"" can be understood as ""an act of stealing a lease deposit by deceiving a tenant (tenant) by those involved in a lease contract, such as a landlord (tenant), a builder, a broker, or a sales agent."" Most of the so-called ""King of Villas"" and ""Billasin"" defrauded tenants of their Jeonse lease deposits in a similar way, mainly targeting new villas or tenants of multi-family homes.
The large-scale Jeonselease fraud occurred because of the difficulty in grasping the market price of new villas, the corruption of pre-sale agencies and licensed real estate agents, and the loopholes in the Jeonse lease loan and Jeonse lease guarantee insurance system. The problem of Jeonse lease fraud has existed before, but in recent years, Jeonse lease fraud has occurred nationwide and systematically because a large number of pre-sale agents, unqualified licensed real estate agents, and brokerage assistants have actively attracted tenants. Due to this Jeonse lease fraud, the Certified Brokerage Act was revised to prevent unqualified licensed real estate agents from operating, but there are no measures or regulations for sale agencies and real estate consulting companies. Therefore, it is hoped that the legislation for the sale agency business and real estate consulting business will be reorganized as soon as possible so that those with expertise and responsibility can mediate and protect the property of the people.
The recent large-scale lease fraud is a complicated combination of insufficient tenant protection, guarantee insurance and lease loan system weaknesses, and legal and institutional problems of licensed real estate agents and real estate consulting companies. The large-scale Jeonse lease fraud has caused great pain and confusion, especially to the common people, and it also makes us think about the principles of private autonomy and the limitations of government intervention.
The principle of private autonomy means that individuals can make their own decisions on matters related to them by respecting human dignity and values, and are also responsible for the decisions they have made. But no individual, no organization, no state is complete, and is free from unreasonable decision-making and unethical deviations and corrupt practices. And it grows through trial and error such as unreasonable decisions and corruption. I sincerely hope that the pain and confusion experienced by our society will be an opportunity to sublimate into an advanced housing welfare system and real estate transaction system.",권경선,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108737381
인공지능시대의 저작권법 과제,"There have been a lot of advances made in the field of artificial intelligence (“AI”) both in Korea and in the Western world. AI has similar impacts on copyright as the printing technology which led to the birth of the copyright law system. Since AI creates contents in a totally different way than human authors do, whether we could acknowledge any originality of those contents created by AI. Even if there is any originality in the AI created contents, there are still debates whether to regard the AI as an author under the current copyright laws. From a utilitarian perspective providing an economic incentive to furthering AI creativity, a substantial amount of commentators agree that the copyright should be grated to either AI owner or user rather than to AI itself.
During the course of contents creation, AI rely on enormous amount of big data or copyright works, which could lead to copyright infringement unless the use is either licensed by copyright owners or regarded as fair use. It would be extremely difficult to tell whether big data analysis by AIs could be allowed as fair use or not. As is the case with the authorship, it is also difficult to tell who is liable for copyright infringement which took place during the course of AI activities. In case of fair use, it will be increasingly difficult to balance the interests of copyright owners and AI users.
Since AI relies on enormous amount of data, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Alibaba have a great advantage in providing their service based on big data analysis. In the age of AI and big data, accordingly, there will be great demands for protecting big data. Big data analysis depends on lots of data, which may require a thorough review of Feist decision, a hot news doctrine, a sui generis database protection and other relevant IP laws.

사형제도의 존폐를 둘러싼 법적 쟁점,"As with the long history of capital punishment, the issue of existence and abolition has been discussed from various perspectives other than legal aspects. As the death penalty is being abolished around the world today, it is true that questions are being raised as to whether it is appropriate to execute it. Korea has been classified as a de facto abolition of the death penalty by the international community after suspending the execution of 23 death row prisoners in December 1997 for 25 years until now. However, it is true that whenever a violent crime occurred, public sentiment and public opinion urged the political community to resume executions and the execution was considered accordingly. The fact that 77.3 percent of respondents chose to maintain the death penalty in last year's domestic poll supports this. It is the third time for the Constitutional Court to judge whether the death penalty is unconstitutional, following 1996 and 2010. The death penalty, a long controversial issue in our society, has been brought back to the open court of the Constitutional Court for the first time in 12 years.

In addition, after examining the pros and cons of the abolition of the death penalty, I would like to explore the problems of the death penalty and ways to improve it.

In addition, the demand for manpower and the demand for training are fundamentally inconsistent due to the highly educated young people and long-term unemployment, and the lack of interest in the industry exposes considerable limitations in nurturing field-oriented industrial manpower. Accordingly, it is necessary to establish a manpower training system that meets the demands of the industrial field according to the 4th industrial revolution, and to solve the labor market mismatch by activating the autonomous development of vocational skills of companies and workers. Fundamental changes are also required in the establishment of infrastructure for vocational competency development, such as vocational education facilities, teachers, and vocational training courses to support this.",방준식,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108686655
‘리벤지 포르노’ 및 디지털성폭력의 피해실태와 대응방안,"These days, the Korean society witnesses the greater severity of the so-called digital sexual violence, which refers to the online circulation of sex videos between lovers or secretly captured videos in public restrooms. This article aims to recognize allegedly individual and temporary personal deviations as gender violence and to seek several measures against such sexual abuse. The author put emphasis on that digital sexual violence is the crime that destructs female self-determination and personality as victims of sexual power wielded by male assailants, and is equivalent to personality homicide since the myriad of infringement undergoes expansive reproduction on the Internet and finally leads victims to commit suicide. The author cited the statistics released by the Korea Communications Commission and the Supreme Prosecutors' Office in order to review in detail actual conditions of violence damages, and pointed out that the judicial punishment is mild for its seriousness. In terms of domestic legislation, particularly in consideration of the article 14 of the Act on Sexual Crime of Violence, this article criticizes the incomprehensive scope of punishment to embrace all types of infringement of rights, unfairness of legal penalty differentiated by the consent of a victim at the time of the filming, and male-biased approach both in the corpus delicti of crime and the interpretation of the courts. This article also looks into main contents and identifies loopholes of the Comprehensive Plan to Damage Prevention of Digital Sexual Crime announced in the Cabinet meeting. Next, since it is necessary to cut off the close relationship surrounding circulation in order to exterminate the production and distribution of sex videos, the author insists the necessity and legitimacy for expansive punishment depending on the types of criminal act and the need for creating legal basis on the Act on Sexual Crime of Violence to promptly delete videos of victims on the Internet. Lastly, the author criticizes the lukewarm attitude of the government and the investigating body in dealing with growing severity of the digital sexual violence, and urges to face that the motive of the digital sexual violence origines from misogyny and to come up with sincere and fundamental measures.",박수현,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106070476
생성형 인공지능(AI) 모델의 법률 문제,"While the public was an observer in the great battles between AlphaGO and Lee Sedol, the public is directly involved in OpenAI’s ChatGPT as a user. This shows that AI is becoming a part of everyday life. However, generative AI still faces the problem of inaccurate information and algorithmic bias. Regulation is likely to come into play, especially if it produces illusory effects or conflicts with human norms. However, if various AI technologies, including algorithms, are approached from a regulatory perspective, it is bound to weaken the competitiveness of the AI industry as a new industry. Therefore, policy measures for technology should basically not hinder technological development. In fact, technology regulation can reduce technological competitiveness.
A way to dilute algorithmic errors, biases, or errors in the content of AI products is to reduce the probability of biased results by providing more data. In order to overcome these problems, it is necessary to secure a variety of data and utilize it as training data. To do this, it will be necessary to pass regulations on fair use under the Copyright Act and restrictions on information analysis under the Copyright Act Amendment. Of course, in this process, the compensation system for rights holders should also be considered. Under fair use, it is difficult to see how it is reasonable for platform operators to monopolize the revenue generated by the data they use. Until now, it has been known that creativity and artistic fields are areas where humans have an advantage in competition with AI, but the legal issues brought by generative AI make it difficult to distinguish between human creation and AI output. As in <Zarya of the Dawn>, it shows that it is not easy to check content using generative AI registered with the U.S. Copyright Administration if the registrant does not notify it, such as the reason why the registration was canceled registration. With these limitations, the US Copyright Office has released registration guidelines for AI-generated content, but it is necessary to conclude how to handle copyright in AI-generated content through more specific discussions. A guideline would bring legal stability to various stakeholders. Of course, generative AI models are created by humans, so there are problems with the current regulatory system. Therefore, a balanced approach between regulation and industry is needed to make AI more transparent and trustworthy so that it can work reasonably with human decision-making.",김윤명,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108574456
강력범죄 피의자 신상공개제도에 대한 비판적 검토,"Our country maintained the posture of disclosing the identity of violent crime suspects in detail until the 1990s. In the wake of a female middle schooler sex violence incident at Miryang in 2004, personal information of assailant students was disclosed, prompting the controversy on human rights violation, and police, in order to protect human rights of the suspects, avoided the identity disclosure for the suspects by covering them with caps and masks. As in October 4, 2005, 'Rules of Police Officers for Human Rights Protection' and ‘Regulations for Human Rights Protection’ were enacted, investigation agencies began not to disclose personal information of suspects such as face. And National Human Rights Commission of the ROK also ruled that disclosure of the identity of suspects in the course of investigation prior to indictment violated personality rights and portrait rights.
But as, around 2010, violent crimes repeatedly continued to take place, public opinion was again in favor of disclosing the identity of suspects. Particularly Chosun Ilbo and Joongang Ilbo disclosed the face of Kang XSun in January 31, 2009, breaking the practice of not disclosing the identity of the suspects until being found guilty. This triggered the controversy about disclosing the face of suspects. Then, in March 2010, the face of Kim XTae was disclosed in many media outlets, resulting in the disclosing the identity of suspects as a practice. Positively reflecting people's sentiments and media's movement as such, the National Assembly newly enacted Clause 8-2 ‘Special Cases regarding Punishment of Certain Violent Crimes’ to prepare the base regulation regarding the disclosure of suspect’s face.
The issue of whether or not to disclose the identity of violent crime suspects as above has become the national interest whenever a specific incident took place. And as a matter of fact, currently plenty of legal and policy-wise issues are being pointed out in the process of the enforcement. Under the circumstances, this study sought to point out the issues in detail focused on the content and operating state of the current system of disclosing the identity of violent crime suspects. ① Related with the principle of presumption of innocence ② Related with inconsistent disclosure focused on the criteria of judgment, the main principal of judgment, period of going public, method of going public ③ Related with the purpose of the identity disclosure system focused on guaranty of people's right to know, prevention of repeated crimes, prevention of crimes, finding of additional criminal facts ④ Related with due process focused on lack of securing appeal right, lack of control by the judiciary, formality of defining the system, causing harm to the suspect's family. The study, rather than suggesting the reasonable methods to improve the current system, ultimately would like to argue in favor of complete abolition of the current system of disclosing the identity of violent crime suspects.",박찬걸,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106406308
반려동물 보유세 도입과 재정고권 강화- 견 보유세를 중심으로 -,"Introduction of the companion animal ownership tax and strengthening of financial sovereignty - Focused on dog ownership tax -

Kim Nam-Wook (Professor, Dept. of Railway Management, Songwon University)

































In Korea, In Korea, the population has decreased due to the low fertility and aging society, while the number of single families is increasing. Recently, the number of urban residents living alone in the city with their families raising dogs and cats is increasing. As pet owners such as dogs and cats abuse or abandon pet animals, the government is reviewing the introduction of a companion animal retention tax to strengthen animal welfare. In particular, as the number of local residents accompanying companion animals increases, local governments expand resting spaces such as playgrounds for companion animals, and expand animal welfare budgets for installation and maintenance of shelters for companion animals due to the increase in abandoned companion animals. is currently doing. Therefore, with the increase of companion animals, local governments are required to prepare independent financial resources in order to prepare an animal welfare system.
Countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom have imposed and collected dog ownership tax in order to curb consumption of luxury goods and prevent rabies and dog bites. The dog tax was abolished as it was more demanded, and Korea imposed dog ownership as a livestock tax in the Local Tax Act enacted in 1946. However, it was repealed in the Local Tax Act of 1951.
Even if the country introduces a companion animal ownership tax to enhance the welfare of companion animals, there are cases in which some local governments in European countries that have been implementing the dog retention tax have abolished the dog retention tax, and owners of companion animals only pay for dogs or cats. There is a backlash against the imposition of a property tax. When introducing a companion animal ownership tax, there is a question as to whether the legislator will reasonably determine the subject of taxation, the tax base, and the tax rate.
Therefore, by examining the necessity of strengthening fiscal authority following the introduction of the companion animal ownership tax and foreign legislation such as Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States, we seek implications for Korea. In addition, according to the tax legalism, we propose a plan to introduce the companion animal ownership tax to the local tax law, the issue of the legislator's discretion in tax resistance and imposition of tax on owners of dogs, etc. following the introduction of the companion animal ownership tax, tax equity for other companion animals This study examines the case law of the German Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court on the issue of excessive legalization of the companion animal retention tax for dangerous dogs and seeks implications for Korea. Finally, the legal issues related to the problem of securing the efficiency of the companion animal retention tax are reviewed in order to strengthen the financial authority.",김남욱,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108285305
「성매매 알선 등 행위의 처벌에 관한 법률」의 개정방향,"The controversy over the effectiveness of The Act on the Punishment of Intermediating in Sex Trade and Associated Acts has been going on since the legislation and enforcement of this law.
Especially in the spring of 2011 the attempts to eradicate sex trade in the red light districts in Yeongdeungpo, mainly led by Seoul metropolitan police agency met with failure because of organized responses and fierce protests from pimps and women involved in sex trade. Their main argument is the law just makes ordinary people criminals and is no use restraining or reducing sex trade industry.
In addition, in December 2012 The Seoul Northern District Court has requested The Constitutional Court to rule on the constitutionality of the penal provision that punish ‘anyone who (voluntarily) trade sex’. This incident raised issues not only about the effectiveness of law but the invasion of constitutional rights.
But sex trade is fundamentally not the same as general trade because sex trade is very serious human rights violation. So the intermediaries (for typical example, pimps) who gained immense profits from this business and clients who buy sex all deserve to be severly punished, then we shouldn’t deny the need for this law.
After this request of the court anti sex trade agencies anticipate the constitutional court will decide to decriminalize only women(part of providing sex) and on the other hand make much efforts to revise this provision in the direction of decriminalizing women.
By the way the law says ‘victims of the sex trade shall not be subjected to punishment for sex trade’. So Anti sex trade agencies also try to revise the definition of victims of sex trade toward enlarging the concept of victims and rearranging the provisions related to protective procedure for women involved in sex trade during police investigation and trial. This is the second-best solution in preparation for possibilities that the decision of Constitutional Court doesn’t meet our hope or the movement for revision in the direction of decriminalizing women is frustrated.
Also it is necessary to reinforce punishment of a person who intermediate in sex trade and associated acts, employ or recruit another person for the purpose of sex selling, introduce work with knowledge that sex trade occurs and advertise activities or agencies where such activities are carried out above mentioned. And it’s needed to adopt the new penal provision that regulate the advertisement on sex trade through the internet.
This paper is mainly about the revision direction of act on the punishment of intermediating in sex trade and associated acts for the right of women involved in sex trade.",고명진,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99883985
소말리아해적에 대한 국제법적 규제와 그 한계,"Maritime piracy disrupts international navigation and trade and threatens the lives and property of people of many nations. Several international organizations including the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the International Maritime Organization and the European Union have been actively engaged in addressing this grave problem. Navies from the EU and NATO and from several countries, including the United States, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea, have deployed their warships off the coast of Somalia and in the Gulf of Aden to protect trade routes because of the recent upsurge of attacks on ships by Somali Pirates. This Article endeavors to establish a framework for individual nations and the international community to respond to pirate attacks in Somali coastal waters. Because many acts of piracy occur initially on the high seas outside Somalia`s territorial waters, these acts fall most prominently within the scope of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention(LOS) and the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA). Accordingly, when permissible, individual nations falling victim to pirate attacks should seek to arrest and prosecute pirates in their national courts under these principal maritime conventions. To address the challenge posed by pirates, the United Nations Security Council has adopted several resolutions authorizing states to take the necessary actions to combat piracy, including in the territorial waters of Somalia. Norms prescribed under several conventions including the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention(UNCLOS), maritime law, and domestic laws of various states provide for jurisdiction by states to prosecute and punish pirates. By the way, current domestic, regional and international legal frameworks fail to adequately combat the nature and scale of maritime piracy. Until now, states and international legal institutions have addressed the piracy problem through a series of conventions, treaties, resolutions and regional agreements. Without a uniform, comprehensive legal framework, states have attempted to tackle piracy as best they can. These limited approaches highlight the deficiencies of international anti-piracy instruments. Thus there is a need for a definitive, international, body of law to systematically govern this field. This article is divided into five parts. Part I is the introduction. Part II briefly reviews the political situation and piracy activities of Somalia. Part III explores the legal framework applicable to piracy and a review of the wide range of international and regional responses to prevent and deter acts of piracy and punish the pirates. Part IV examines the operations which have been coordinated by NATO, the EU, and a coalition led by the United States, in addition to several countries operating on their own. The concluding Part V contains the limitation on the regulation of piracy by international law and the recommendations.",김채형 ( Chai Hyung Kim ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99586594
학교구성원의 교육활동(교권) 보호 인식에 관한 연구 -I 광역시를 중심으로-,"This study conducted a survey of 1,951 teachers, 3,074 students, and 2,869 parents in the I Metropolitan City Office of Education, and analyzed the differences in conceptual awareness and feelings toward teachers between the groups based on the collected data. In addition, responses to open-ended questions about the protection of educational activities were analyzed for word frequency and word clouds using Nvivo12, and implications for each group of school members were drawn by category. Unlike previous studies that focus on the causes and consequences of infringement of educational activities in schools, this study focuses on the realistic voices of school members surrounding the protection of educational activities based on the analysis of an open-ended question.
As a result, the study found significant differences in school members’ perceptions of the concept of school rights and their feelings toward teachers, as well as parents’ and students’ perceptions of the prerequisite conditions that lead to “school rights violations” when teachers do not have adequate professionalism and character in the process of violating educational activities. These results show that teachers should try to internalize fairness in educational activities, pedagogical expertise and educational support for students, and students and parents should make mutual efforts to restore trust in schools and teachers, and provide an opportunity for reflection within the teacher group.
Despite this, considering the fact that our society has allowed the inherent violence in various forms of educational infringements (abuse of educational authority) under the name of ‘complaints,’ there is a need to explore alternatives that expand the horizon of reflection among school members who do not tolerate any form of violence and that enhance the protection of educational activities (educational authority). Just as climate change has demanded the restoration of the environmental ecosystem, the educational ecosystem also requires trustworthy approaches among educational constituents.",정소민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739248
동물 전시의 윤리적ㆍ법적 문제와 동물원의 현대적 과제에 대한 법적 고찰 ― 스와질란드 일레븐 사건(Born Free USA v. Norton case)을 글감으로 하여 ―,"This paper aims to review a study on ethicalㆍlegal issues of animal exhibition and modern challenges of Zoo. In this paper, I review main arguments of Animal Liberation and Animal Right, and then I try to analyze Born Free USA v. Norton case, to suggest modern challenges of Zoo.
Case synopsis and facts of Born Free USA v. Norton are as follows. Plaintiff advocates for the welfare of elephants sued defendant federal officials, alleging that the officials improperly issued a permit for zoos to import endangered African elephants in violation of the Convention on International Trade In Endangered Species(CITES), and the National Environmental Policy Act(NEPA). The advocates moved for a preliminary injunction against the importation. The zoos sought to import the wild elephants from a foreign country which determined that its herd needed to be reduced and that the elephants would be killed if they were not exported. The advocates contended that the officials improperly found under CITES that the importation of the elephants was not detrimental to the species and was not for a primarily commercial purpose, and that the officials failed to conduct an appropriate environmental evaluation as required by NEPA. The advocates' motion for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the importation of the elephants was denied. The court had to determine what was worse for the elephants, death or transports to the zoos. The court explained that its principal consideration was what would happen to the elephants if the injunction was granted.
This case may have important implications for the role of court on animal issues and modern challenges of Zoo. We can also learn something from reviewing Born Free USA v. Norton case. First, when we make a judgment of legal issues on animal exhibition, it is important to consider the interests of animals. Second, current zoo system needs to change, because it has elements that contradict with animal welfare.
Generally it is said that the role of zoo are Recreation, Education, Research and Conservation of Wild Populations. WAZA(the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums) says that the vision and roles of zoos are Conservation of Wild Populations, Science and Research, Population Management, Education and Training, Marketing and Public Relations, Partnerships and Politics, Sustainability, Ethics and Animal Welfare. But zoo’s primary function is limited to the supply of recreation. This paper emphasizes that zoos should try to conservation of wild populations, be a shelter for animal.",함태성,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104901636
간호법 제정에 관한 검토,"This article is a review of the Nursing Act (bill) currently pending in the National Assembly, in relation to the “shortage of medical personnel” which is one of the most important problems experienced in the current Corona situation, based on a critical perspective on the current medical law.
The first part of this article is allotted to reviewing the history and current status of legislation. The history of the failure of nursing law independence, which has been promoted for more than 45 years, is briefly reviewed, and the main issues of pros and cons that remain unchanged even today are reviewed. These are the dependency problem of nursing work, the effectiveness problem of the professional nurse system, and the status problem of the nursing assistant.
In the middle of the article, in relation to these conflicting issues, the contents of the current Medical Service Act and the pending Nursing Act (bill) were reviewed in detail. In particular, the main study was to analyze in detail how much the problems of the current Medical Service Act can be solved through the Nursing Act (bill), but the results were somewhat disappointing. The effectiveness of the enactment of the Nursing Act (bill) can be expected with respect to the problem of the scope of work and improving treatment of nurses, but the policy for professional nurses and nursing assistants is prescribed as ‘not to solve, but to ignore’.
In the last part of the article, a critical review of the excessive prudence that ignores the medical reality was conducted. The vertical structure that exists in the medical system, the power bias toward nurses, who have an absolute majority of women, and the problems in the current medical system, which are consistent with the logic of adherence to interests and economic feasibility, are summarized and critically analyzed based on major issues.",이여주,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108058588
인공지능 관련 저작권 침해에 관한 시론,"Copyright infringement related to artificial intelligence needs to be addressed in terms of AI learning stage and use stage of AI output. Considering the current degree of development of AI technology, it is thought that the issue of copyright infringement occurring in AI learning stage should be solved more urgently than the issue of copyright infringement occurring in use stage of AI output. Artificial intelligence learning step requires large-scale data input and the use of almost all works as data, making it difficult to solve with conventional fair use law. Accordingly legislative cases in each country, including South Korea, are trying to solve the issue of copyright infringement that may occur in the AI learning stage by placing a new fair use clause or a clause allowing text data mining (TDM). On the other hand, I am of the view that copyright infringement that may occur in the stage of using AI output can be largely resolved by the existing laws of infringement and tort liability. However, even in this area, ""depending on the development of technology,"" there could be marginal cases that are difficult for existing legal principles to solve.
Whether an artificial intelligence output has creativity or copyright- ability is a matter that is directly related to whether an artificial intelligence output can infringe on other's copyright. On one side of the view that the copyrightability of artificial intelligence output should be denied, it seems that the current artificial intelligence output can only be used in limited areas such as stock articles, weather articles, and sampling music. Looking at the level of AI(GAN) artwork, chatbot and language translation using NLP, it is necessary to examine in detail whether the AI technology grasps the context from a semantic point of view, and whether creative individuality is expressed accordingly. It is my view that whether pattern recognition, numerical vectorization of characteristics, and probabilistic models adopted by artificial intelligence technology have reached the point where AI can understand human expressions from the viewpoint of semantics not syntactics should be judged legally in the concrete case. An abundance of these discussions will lead to appropriate conclusions on whether to provide legal protection for artificial intelligence output or who to hold legally liable for situations in which artificial intelligence output is believed to infringe on other people's copyrights.
This study also discusses the legal nature of open-source license associated with the Edmond de Belamy portrait case. In the AI development process, open source is widely used in the form of open source-based development platforms such as TensorFlow, development tools, and machine learning libraries such as PyTorch. Since AI development requires extensive human and material resources, it is taking an open source community-based development method in which various developers can participate. Regarding the legal treatment of artificial intelligence's achievements and output, it is also necessary to note the legal nature of open-source license applied in the development and distribution process of AI output.",전응준,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107816696
다문화가족지원법의 문제점과 개선방향 : 이주민 삶의 질과 사회통합 관점에서,"After immigrants came to Korea in the late 20th century, the Korean government focused on granting migrant qualifications. However, these policies alone did not guarantee a healthy life for immigrants, causing problems such as poverty among marriage immigrants, family conflicts and domestic violences, and social exclusion. With the enforcement of the Multicultural Families Support Act in 2008, the integration of migrants and indigenous peoples began to be considered. This study compares the law with related laws in terms of whether the provisions of the Multicultural Family Support Act, which is mainly applied to marriage immigrants in Korea, which is in an era of population decline and a multicultural society, guarantees migrants’ healthy life and contributes to social integration. After reviewing, the revision direction of the same law is suggested.
The Multicultural Families Support Act is a legal norm to protect the families of marriage immigrants married to Koreans, and excludes support for families of foreign workers, overseas Koreans, refugees, etc., who make up half of foreign residents in Korea. In this aspect, this study suggests they also needs legal protections as much as marriage immigrants and their families. Next, it is necessary to strengthen the overall policy coordination function regarding supporting policies for marriage immigrants’ families and a multicultural understanding education. And this study also insists the regulatory needs for businesses in order to reduce a social exclusion. Lastly, this study suggests the necessity of supplementing laws that encourage members of multicultural families to perform military service and providing provisions to prevent discrimination.",이은채,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108055028

The core element of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the artificial intelligence (AI) based on the software of the computer, while the individual developed technologies converge.
The effects of the AI era on the Korean society will be beyond our imagination. As the history of humans in technology-centered society is eloquent, the AI age of the fourth industrial revolution, the intelligence information society, will be a society coexisting with AI robots. In the AI era, robots will be able to increase their leisure time by replacing people's work, which will make the life of mankind more enrichable.
Artificial intelligence is expected to grow rapidly as a means of replacing humans away from auxiliary means for humans. The media has also listed the jobs that artificial intelligence will replace, and it is said that surprise us will replace professionals such as judges, lawyers, and doctors, such as law or medicine. Thanks to such brilliant developments in artificial intelligence, the laws of the country and around the world are also pushing for change. A system incorporating artificial intelligence such as a program for researching legal information, a forecasting system for boards, and a big data processing system for legal statistics has already been developed, commercialized, or under development.

혐오표현: 표현의 자유와 차별 금지 ― 유럽인권재판소의 최신 판례 분석을 중심으로 ―,"It is difficult to set specific standards to exactly define the relationship between freedom of expression and hate speech. Empirically, hate speech is related to the intimate identity of individuals. In particular, it is not easy to find specific harms of hate speech, which makes it difficult to regulate it by law. Under international human rights law, freedom of expression is regarded as a fundamental right to the enjoyment of all other human rights, and for this reason restrictions on freedom of expression are narrowly interpreted. In the ECtHR case of ‘Atamanchuk v. Russia (2020),’ a three-step review was conducted to determine whether or not the criminal punishment imposed on the applicant Atamanchuk violated Article 10 of the Convention. The first step is to determine whether the restrictions are ‘provided by law.’ The second step is to examine whether the aim of the Criminal Act provision can be considered as ‘legitimate.’ The third step is to determine whether the infringement of the applicant’s freedom of expression by criminal punishment is considered as ‘necessary in a democratic society.’ The European Court of Human Rights concluded that the Russian government did not violate Article 10 (Freedom of Expression) of the European Convention. In the case of ‘Beizaras and Levickas v. Lithuania (2020),’ the European Court of Human Rights referred to several reports on LGBTI human rights in Lithuania, and found that the Lithuanian authorities’ refusal to prosecute those who wrote serious homophobic expressions violated Article 8 in conjunction with Article 14. Furthermore, the Lithuanian authorities have positive obligations to protect LGBTI people from perpetrators of hate speech.
