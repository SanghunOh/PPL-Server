
청소년의 신종마약류중독 실태 및 대응방안 연구,"This study presents effective preventive measures through analysis of the actual condition of adolescents' new drug addiction. Compared to a decade ago, Korea's status and status of the Drug Administration is falling sharply, and official statistics and surveys prove that demand for new drugs among teenagers is increasing along with the increase in drug offenders. As a result of the study, psychological, personal, social, and cultural and environmental causes such as stress, curiosity, entrance examination, and employment were combined to obtain the characteristics of access to drugs, and the number of adolescents approaching new drugs for stronger and cheaper reasons was also derived. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between the increase in juvenile crimes caused by new drug addiction and the problems of the government's response method and to present efficient measures for prevention.As a prevention and response plan, first, a plan to overhaul the youth drug control system. Second, the establishment of strict penalties for suppliers of new drugs. Third, strengthening monitoring and monitoring of new distribution channels. Fourth, strengthening the treatment of juvenile drug offenders. Fifth, strengthening prevention education for youth new drug addiction was suggested. Finally, the institutional mechanism that can effectively and intensively operate the proposed measures and the interest of our society should be premised.",이무송,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108193343
청소년 신종마약사범의 실태에 관한 연구,"In 2021, there were about 450 juvenile drug offenders. Compared to the total number of drug offenders, the number is very small, but the number has jumped more than 10 times from 41 in 2011. As statistics show, the rate of increase in juvenile drug offenders is increasing very rapidly, and eventually in recent years, the age group of the main perpetrators and victims of drug crimes can become adolescents. The main cause of such juvenile drug crimes is that drugs that are easily exposed to drug advertisements posted on social networking services (SNS) and started out of curiosity gradually develop into serious problems due to their addictive nature. According to the 2021 Drug Crime White Paper, teenagers are often exposed to drug sales advertisements through SNS or websites, and the reality is that there is a very lack of blocking and monitoring of these advertisements. In addition, it is noteworthy that unlike in the past when buyers and sellers met in person in the past, the distribution system that encountered drugs through SNS and easily bought and sold drugs using virtual assets is a trend. In the end, it becomes a distribution complex where teenagers who are familiar with the online environment can easily access drugs than before. Another characteristic is that if drug offenders in the past matched supply and demand through professional distribution organizations along with crime-related organizations, it is also a big problem that drug offenders are now moving to first-time offenders. In addition, psychotropic drugs such as fentanyl and diethamine are rapidly increasing among adolescents, and recently, problems such as taking fentanyl with peers have been continuously occurring at school, which is very adversely affecting the physical and mental health of adolescents. Therefore, as a countermeasure against these new drugs, a control tower should be prepared to support them to escape from the new drugs through preventive education, treatment, and rehabilitation rather than punishment.",이은영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108296932
"유튜브 ‘사이버렉카’ 채널은 어떻게 악성댓글을 양산하는가? 유튜버 익명성, 규범 동조, 혐오의 반향실 효과를 중심으로","This study focuses on Cyber-Wrecker, which is an emerging type of personalized media contents to produce views and comments by posting videos about celebrity scandals or incidents, and online toxicity it generates. In particular, we analyzed what characteristics of Cyber- Wrecker encouraged toxicity in comments at the video level by selecting four representative Cyber-Wreckers on YouTube, collecting about 290,000 comments on 370 videos from their channels, and classifying malicious comments with an artificial neural network to measure the degree of toxicity production. To do so, we tested research hypotheses drawing upon 1) the structural conditions of YouTubers’ anonymity, 2) normative conformity among users performing grouporiented thoughts and behaviors toward Cyber-Wrecker, and 3) the reinforcement of hate projected on the target of Cyber-Wrecker that stimulated in-group unity and out-group hostility through the echochamber effect. The results showed that anonymous Cyber-Wreckers were more effective in generating toxicity than those that revealed their identities, and that toxicity production increased when the targets of Cyber-Wrecker were socially hated. In other words, Cyber-Wrecker’s sensationalized coverage of celebrities and public figures was effective in increasing toxicity by selecting targets that reflected hate sentiments of our society. On the other hand, overtly malicious videos, such as biased portrayals and mockery, had no significant effect on the production of toxicity. Based on the results, this study sheds light on how Cyber-Wreckers as an emerging online content creator promotes the spread of toxicity and discusses ways to understand and address the growing influence of the personalized media ecosystem, not only at the industrial level but also culturally.",이신행,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639569
청소년 마약범죄 문제 연구,"Drug addiction is no longer exclusive to adults. The official number of juvenile drug offenders in 2022 was 481, but the actual number of offenders may have reached as many as 13,000 people if the unofficial drug crime rate was to be applied. Despite the government's various countermeasures against drug crimes, the increasing number of drug crimes threatens the ordinary life of teenagers. It is necessary to seek fundamental measures tailored to adolescent drug users in consideration of their characteristics instead of implementing single policy that covers all age groups.
Compared to adults, the adolescents are more prone to brain damage caused by drug use and the time it takes to get addicted is shorter, resulting in more frequent withdrawal. In addition, it was confirmed that ""adolescent stress and low self-esteem"" and ""peer culture"" were significantly related to drug abuse as criminal psychological factors of adolescents.
As a countermeasure considering the above characteristics and factors: first, treatment intervention should be made at the same time as detection of drug usage in order to minimize brain damage and addiction of youth drug users. Second, it is necessary to form a desirable peer culture by opening peer group meeting programs for adolescent drug addicts in correctional facilities to share experiences and the will to quit using drug. Finally, it is necessary to provide in-depth drug-related training to teachers in charge so that effective preventive education can be provided to adolescents. Also, reviews must be made at the lever of Office of Education on the standards for performance recognition regarding the preventive education. In addition, by recognizing that adolescents’ use of drugs is not only their problem and providing preventive education to faculty and parents as well, youth protection from drugs should be provided from a more macroscopic perspective.",박소희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108783675

의학에서 인공지능 도입의 현재와 미래,"The Alpha Go event of 2016 reflects today's feelings mixed with anxiety and anticipation about Artificial intelligence(AI). AI was about only to mimic a single human nerve, but now it has reached a level that can simulate a human neural network. As computing power increases exponentially, AI has become more applicable and has entered the medical field. If the accuracy of the AI based diagnosis is higher than that of the human, the possibility of transferring the authority of diagnosis from human to AI based diagnosis is likely to be the choice of the Evidence Based Medicine. Furthermore, when the diagnosis or treatment of AI proves to be superior or more accurate than a human physician, the normative level of the physician's duty of care will change. If so, will AI be perceived as a human being or a subject of medical practice? It will be a question whether AI can become a legal entity that can be responsible for the wrongdoing. In the case of automobiles in which modern technology is integrated and operated in a complex way, even if problems arise in the process of intelligent work that is based on decision making, the service or automobile is not responsible for the accident on its own. In other words, if the machine does not know exactly what the human will is, or if the machine can not perform correctly, the responsibility for the accident is mainly the manufacturer. It is difficult to define intelligence as it is now, and it is more difficult and ambiguous to define AI. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain logical persuasiveness in discussing the legal subjecthood of AI in the current state. On the other hand, the benefits expected from the introduction of AI medicine include avoiding human error, reducing costs, improving quality of care, and preventing health inequalities. However, as long as AI will bring more light into the future, its shadow can also become darker. As the spread of artificial intelligence dissemination, layperson who do not know programming will be able to participate in patching and spreading of fake information, and wrong medical information can be spread more easily and quickly through AI service. In addition, though the things, such as medical care, nursing, filling prescription or medication instruction, that are regarded as only human being can do are done by AI, and if it is hard to distinguish by whom it has been done, then the mutual relationship of human being and its value will inevitably weakened. Furthermore, AI still remains at the level of simulating some functions of human intelligence, if AI become similar to the god of self existence and controls human life with its free will, we need to reconsider whether it is right to continue to develop these technologies.",동재준,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106018516
한국의 초저출산 극복을 위한 정책조합 연구,"In 2022, Korea recorded the world's lowest fertility rate of 0.78, along with a decline in the total population. Considering the social and economic effects that low birth will inevitably cause, it is clear that the low fertility rate is an urgent national policy problem to be overcome. Therefore, this study aims to present effective and applicable policy alternatives to improve Korea's fertility rate. To this end, our first step was to construct a panel data of 24 OECD countries from 1995 to 2021 and figure out what factors affected the fertility rate by using regression analysis and fuzzy-set analysis. According to fuzzy-set multiple conjunctural causations analysis, eight policy combinations were associated with high fertility rates. Among them, we recommended two policy combinations for the Korean government: [high child allowance expenditure + high parental leave expenditure + high public childcare enrollment rate] and [high child allowance expenditure + high immigrant rate + high public childcare enrollment rate]. Given the high level of childcare enrollment rate in Korea, we argued that the government should strengthen income security for families with children, especially during parental leave and that Korea should actively embrace immigration and prepare for social integration with them.",양재진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108651259

일본 후쿠시마 원전 오염수 방류 관련 국제공조 방안,"In April 2011, the Japanese government decided to release 1.25 million tons of radioactively contaminated water from the Fukushima accident nuclear power after filtering system(ALPS) over 30 years from April 2023.
Since tritium and other radioactive contaminants cannot be filtered out by ALPS, released contaminant into the ocean inveitably endanger the safety of food and living environment for citizens of neighboring countries. While radioactive contamination affects the safety of citizens over a wide and long period of time, international legal system is not efficient enough to response to the threat of nuclear material on behalf of the safety and interests of innocent citizens.
The goal of this study is to develop an effective response plan that Gyeonggi-do as a local government can prepare for the safety of citizens when Japanese government actually release radioactively contaminated water.
This study suggests Gyeonggi-do to establish the “East Asia Nuclear Safety Regime” as the final goal in the frame of the urban diplomacy of the local government to promote nuclear safety of citizens. Considering nuclear safety hazards such as the rapidly increasing nuclear power generation facilities on the east coast of China and the occurrence of earthquakes on the Korean Peninsula, a nuclear safety community will be an essential part for East Asian countries.

In order to realize the purpose of the study, a study was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 early childhood teachers who were practicing educational activities in the field of early childhood education. The results of the study are as follows. First, early childhood teachers judged that the right to school is a right to an educational philosophy, a right to a class, and a right related to human rights. Second, the types of violations of school rights were violations of overall educational activities, violations of privacy, and violations of parental solidarity. On the other hand, it was suggested that appropriate leadership training for managers, development of training programs for teachers and parents, and revision of laws and systems are needed as a way to improve school rights violations.

From the German unification experience, we learned that the unification cost was too costly to the German people. The German government spent 5% of GDP annually for 10 years after unification in order to reduce the economic gap between the East and West Germany.
Currently the North Korean economic situation gets much worse than that of the former East Germany. If the unification is achieved under the current situation, the South Korea will face unbearable economic burden, therefore the South Korean government should increase the size of the inter-Korean Cooperation Fund in order to mitigate costly unification cost in the future, In consideration of the German experience, we suggest that the optimal annual accumulation of the Fund be 3% of GDP.",신동천,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76521842

Abstract: The present study aimed to examine the mediating role of social comparison orientation and state fear of missing out between self-concept clarity and SNS addiction proneness. For this purpose, 380 undergraduate students completed self-report questionnaires: Self-concept Clarity Scale, Iowa-Netherland Comparison Orientation Measure, State-Fear of Missing Out, and SNS Addiction Proneness Scale for College Students. As a result of the analysis, in the relationship between self-concept clarity and SNS addiction proneness, the simple mediating effect of state fear of missing out was significant. However, the simple mediating effect of social comparison orientation was not significant. The relationship between self-concept clarity and SNS addiction proneness was sequentially mediated by social comparison orientation and state fear of missing out. This result suggests that the lower the level of self-concept clarity, the more social comparisons you make with others, and you can experience fear of missing out in online and SNS, leading to SNS addiction. It is expected that SNS addiction can be further alleviated by dealing with the state-fear of missing out in the therapeutic scene.

청소년의 긴장요인이 약물남용에 미치는 영향,"A Study on the Effect of Juvenile’s Strain on the Drug AbuseYujeong Choe & Sora Shin

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of strain on drug abuse in juvenile and to propose preventive policies. According to the “White Paper on Drug-related Crimes (2021)” the total number of drug-related crime offenders decreased but the number of offenders under the age of 19 increased. These results shocked society by showing that ordinary citizens and teenagers are no exception to drug abuse crimes that have been recognized as exclusive to a specific group. The research method analyzed the factors of strain and drug abuse through logistic regression analysis in the survey data on juvenile drug behavior. In this study, the effect of the strain factors of juvenile experienced in daily activities on their drug abuse behavior was analyzed according to the GST. As a result, it was analyzed that the more juveniles who feel more stress and loneliness and have more experience of violent crime victimization, the higher the possibility of drug abuse. In order to prevent juvenile drug abuse, first of all, the subject of survey on drugs that were only targeting adults should be expanded to juvenile. For juvenile, drugs have already entered their daily lives, so simple preventive education on drug abuse is not enough. It is possible to cope only by knowing through what process they are exposed to drugs. In addition, juvenile should develop their ability to properly cope with strain in their daily lives.Therefore, various counseling programs such as personal counseling or group counseling, and activities other than subjects that can relieve strain should be prepared.

묻지마 범죄자들의 특성과 적절한 처우 집행을 위한 제언: 빅데이터 분석을 통한 대중적 인식을 중심으로,"If an offender has no correlation with a victim, holds no logical reason for the crime, and uses violence to unspecified individuals, he/she is generally defined as a random-crime offender.
Unpredictability of the crime and the degree of its damage is the reason for the fear of the random-crime. However, a definite definition of the random-crime has yet to be made and it still remains ambiguous. In this research, literatures of the random-crime are reviewed, and the perception of people on the random-crime is analyzed using the big-data analysis. Search terms related to the random crime on the online-news from 2013 to 2018 were collected through the crawling technique and analyzed by the R-studio. As the result, 'incident' and 'police' were the most frequently searched terms from 2013 to 2014; however, 'female' and 'incident' were the most frequently searched terms after 2016. From this data, it can be acknowledged that a term 'female' was not considered significant until the Gangnam-station homicide in 2016; and such rapidly increased attention on the element 'female' became a main factor of the random-crime in people's perception. However, generalizing the random-crime from a single case can generate obstacles in finding proper methods of rehabilitation and correction. Therefore, it is necessary to reform people's perception on the random-crime and establish suitable solution from the government.",이수정,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105973851

"같지만 다른 그들, 청년: 성별 자살생각과 자살시도 영향요인의 탐색 연구","The purpose of this study is to provide basic data for an effective suicide prevention policy among young people. This study is an exploratory research study conducted to examine the difference between suicidal ideation and suicide attempt according to factors such as socioeconomic characteristics, health characteristics, psychosocial factors, and family factors. A survey was conducted by stratifying 1,012 young people aged 20-39 across the country, and descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed. The results show that 42.1% of the study subjects had suicidal ideation and 5.6% had attempted suicide. The factors affecting suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were different by gender. Men had a higher risk of suicidal ideation when they had lower levels of education, subjective health status, sleep quality, and family strength (economic stability and cooperation) and higher levels of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The higher depressive symptoms increased suicidal ideation in women. The factors influencing suicide attempts in men were high income, high depressive symptoms, and low family strength (caring about the community). In the case of women, unemployment, high subjective economic status, high depressive symptoms, and high social trust were influencing factors. For effective suicide prevention policy among young people, it is necessary to subdivide and specify the policy according to the characteristics of those people. In particular, the factors that cause people to respond differently to suicidal ideation and attempt should be closely identified, and it is necessary to understand the distribution of factors influencing gender and the patterns that appear due to differences in sensitivity.",강지원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108548714
