Jung)의 심리 기능에 대한 진화심리학적 관점의 해석,"This study began with questions about the ultimate causes of the four psychological functions(sensory perception, intuitive perception, thinking judgment, and emotional judgment) suggested by Carl Jung. To find answers to these questions, I adopted evolutionary psychology as the framework of analysis of four functions. Then, I basically accepted the evolutionary psychological assumption that psychological function is an evolved mind mechanism designed by natural selection. Some research problems to find answers from an evolutionary psychological point of view were as follows: First, to find out whether it is possible to interpret the four functions from an evolutionary point of view, I analyzed the evolutionary color that the attributes of the four functions contain. Second, I outlined the main perspectives and principles of evolutionary psychology about the mind, and the attributes of evolved psychology, which is a core concept. Third, I interpreted four psychological functions according to the perspective and research method of evolutionary psychology. These procedures were subdivided into sub-research content. 1) Common points of view between the four functions and the mind of evolutionary psychology were explored. 2) It was analyzed whether the four functions have the properties of the evolved psychological mechanism. 3) Through reverse-engineering and thinking experiments, it was verified whether the four functions can be said to be psychological mechanisms for adaptation and survival. 4) The reason for why the recognition and judgment functions evolved into a form of individual difference in a dichotomous manner was explored. To answer research problems, I used methods such as literature review, analysis, and thought experiments. Through the discussion, the meaning of the results according to the research questions was examined, and the limitations of the study, the direction of follow-up research, and implications were stated sequentially.",최태진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3128836

"여성 중간관리자의 경력열망, 경력몰입, 경력성공 간의 관계: 상사지원인식의 조절된 매개효과 검증","The purpose of his study is to examine the structural relationship between career aspiration, career commitment, career success, and Perceived Supervisory Support of female middle managers. To do this, mediating, moderating, and moderated mediating effect were sequentially analyzed using second term’s first manager survey data (2020) from Korean Women Manager Panel(KWMP). The results of this study are as follows. First, in the relationship between career aspiration and career success of female middle managers, career commitment showed a fully mediating effect. Second, there was no moderating effect of Perceived Supervisory Support on the relationship between career aspiration and career success of female middle managers. Third, the moderating effect of Perceived Supervisory Support was found in the relationship between career commitment and career success of female middle managers. Lastly, it was found that there was a moderated mediating effect of Perceived Supervisory Support in that the career aspiration of female middle managers effected career success through career commitment. Therefore, this study is meaningful in that it structurally examined the relationship between factors related to career and support of female middle managers. Based on this, the significance of this study and suggestions for follow-up research are presented.",임혜련,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107913282
인구 집단의 스케일의 확장이 집단 비율 및 집단 크기 지각에 미치는 영향:다수편향적 사회적 정보 활용을 중심으로,"New media moved the place of social exchange to the Internet, allowing large groups to communicate in one place beyond the limits of time and space. Recent studies have also reported cases in which human social abilities do not keep up with the expansion of group scale through social media. In this context, current study investigated how human perception of social information is affected by the expansion of the group scale in the context of majority bias. Using Internet-based task, the psychological processes that group ratio and group size are perceived and affect majority-biased social information use were investigated, and whether group scale moderates those processes was examined. The group ratio has a positive effect on the majority bias, and the relationship was partially mediated by ratio perception. Group scale did not moderate the relationship between group ratio and ratio perception. On the other hand, the correlation between group size and majority-biased social information use was not significant. Group scale moderates group size perception. The group size and size perception showed positive correlation under the smaller group scale condition. However under the extended group scale condition, the perceived group size became significantly lower and lost its correlation with group size. These results provide evidence that the psychological mechanism related to group size perception was not properly responding to the expansion of the group scale. Furthermore, the possibility of a specific psychological mechanism for processing group size information and the form of information input specifically accepted by majority bias were discussed from perspective of evolutionary psychology.",장재경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102778614
아동기 정서적 학대와 성인기 우울 증상 간의 관계: 과거 부정적 시간관의 매개효과,"The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mediating role of negative past time perspective on relationship between childhood emotional maltreatment and adult depressive symptoms. Three hundreds thirty college students completed questionnaires to assess childhood emotional maltreatment, negative past time perspective and depression. The data were analyzed by SPSS 22.0 and AMOS 22.0. The results of the correlation analysis indicated that childhood emotional maltreatment and adult depressive symptoms had positive relation. Past negative time perspective was positively correlative with depression. Using a structural equation modeling, this study examined whether negative past time perspective mediate a relationship between childhood emotional maltreatment and depressive symptoms. The results showed that past negative time perspective totally mediated the relationship between childhood emotional maltreatment and depression. These findings suggest that intervention should emphasize on past negative time perspective for adult depressive symptoms.",신지수,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3128834
부모의 아동학대가 청소년의 공격성에 미치는 영향: 우울·불안의 매개효과 및 자아존중감의 조절된 매개효과,"The purpose of this study is to identify the effects of parental child abuse on adolescent aggression and the role of depression, anxiety, and self-esteem in the process. This study was conducted to help manage the aggression of adolescents by examining how the psychological factors such as depression and anxiety and the personal factor, self-esteem, mediate or control the effects of parental child abuse on adolescent aggression. For the purpose of this study, data from the 16th (2021) Children's Supplementary Survey of the Korea Welfare Panel was used, and in this study, a total of 325 high school students were used in the analysis, excluding 12 non-current students out of a total of 337 who completed the survey did. As a result of the study, first, the mediating effect of depression and anxiety between the experience of child abuse and the aggression of adolescents was significant, and it was confirmed that they played a partial mediating role. Second, it was confirmed that there was a moderated mediating effect of self-esteem regulating the mediating effects of depression and anxiety between parental child abuse and adolescent aggression. Based on this, a method for reducing adolescent aggression was suggested by confirming the functions of depression and anxiety and self-esteem necessary to reduce adolescent aggression.",박정아,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108326721
밀론대학생성격검사(MCCI)를 통한 학사경고자의 유형과 특성 분석,"The purpose of this study is to classify the types of students on Academic Probation using Millon College Counseling Inventory(MCCI) standardized for College student characteristics and to prepare a customized counseling intervention plan according to the type. To this end, 455 College Students who received Academic Probation in the previous semester were surveyed for MCCI, Satisfaction with Major departments, Satisfaction with Academic adviser, and Part-time jobs. The investigated data were analyzed through Binomial Logistic Regression Analysis, Cluster analysis, and One-way Analysis of Variance. As a result of the study, MCCI Eight factors were derived for predicting Academic Probation, including three scales of Personality styles(Dejected, Unruly, Denigrated), two scales of Expressed concerns(Mental health upset, Academic concerns), and three scales of Clinical signs(Suicidal tendencies, Attention(Cognitive) deficits, Alcohol abuse). Next, the Academic Probation type was classified into three clusters, cluster 1 was named ‘Short-term satisfaction-seeking dominant type’, cluster 2 was named ‘Maladaptive perfectionism dominant type’, and cluster 3 was named ‘Dejected/Anxiety Negative emotion dominant type’. In the discussion, the main characteristics of Academic Probation for each cluster were explained, and implications for customized counseling intervention measures for each cluster were suggested.",조해진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3128838
자극의 인출난이도와 연합강도가 기억억제에 미치는 효과,"The present study was designed to investigate the effect of the difficulty level of retrieval practice and the association strength of categories and stimuli within categories on memory inhibition. Most of the studies have investigated whether inhibition was occurred by manipulating the degree of association strength, emotion value or physical characteristics of non-retrieval practice words within the retrieval practice category. Therefore, it was necessary to study how inhibition occurs according to the degree of difficulty of retrieval stimuli during retrieval practice. The difficulty of retrieval was manipulated into three levels: difficult condition, normal condition, and easy condition through the degree of presentation of consonants and vowels of words during retrieval learning. Additionally, the strength of association between categories and words within categories was manipulated. In previous studies, retrieval-induced forgetting occurred under conditions where the association strength between categories and words within the categories was strong. On the other hand, retrieval-induced forgetting did not occur under conditions where the association strength between categories and words within the categories was weak. The present study, if the inhibition process differs according to the difficulty of retrieval, the possibility of different results from previous studies was explored according to the difference in the strength of association with the category. As a result of the study, in the condition of strong association strength, retrieval-induced forgetting was observed under normal and difficult retrieval difficulty conditions. Whereas retrieval-induced forgetting was not observed under conditions of easy retrieval difficulty condition. In the condition of weak association strength, retrieval-induced forgetting tended to occur under difficult retrieval difficulty conditions. Whereas retrieval-induced forgetting was not observed under conditions of normal and easy retrieval difficulty condition. These results suggest that memory inhibition may appear differently depending on the difficulty of retrieval.",정윤재,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107913283
가족 사랑을 예술로 승화시킨 화가 이중섭의 성격유형 - MBTI이론의 관점으로 -,"This study would investigate the personality type of Lee Jung-Seob, a star-crossed artist of genius who sublimated the love of family to art analyzing his life from the MBTI theory perspective to help an in-depth understanding of his world of art and the impacts of the personality type on the growth and development of his personality type.
For this purpose, this study analyzed through Choi Yeol’s “Lee Jung-Seob’s critical biography” and “Lee Jung-Seob’s Letter”and drew the following results for Lee Jung-Seob’s personality type.
First, his personality type is INFP, which is quiet and silent, has a warm heart, and pursues an ideal.
Second, his dominant function is introverted feeling (Fi), and his sub-function is extroverted intuition (Ne). He did artist activities with the belief that love and art are one. Even when he was away from his family, he conveyed his warm heart with letters to his family members and delivered messages of hope so that they would not be in despair with positiveness that turns tragedy into comedy.
Third, his tertiary function is sensation (S), and his inferior function is extroverted thinking (Te). With the manifestation of these functions, extreme stress, such as frustration due to the loss of or separation from important human relations, the sense of loss due to negative responses to and criticisms of him, and despair due to evaluations going against his artistic values, made his functions in the unconscious area overwhelm his dominant function and sub-function. Due to this stress, Lee Jung-Seob punished himself by refusing to eat and harming himself, judging that he was incompetent, and worried his family very much by cutting his contact with them by aggressive behaviors. In addition, he encountered a tragic outcome that he ended his life lonesomely at a hospital due to his abnormal behaviors (neurasthenic neurosis).
Thus, this study has significance in that it provides a new paradigm for discovering the base of personality in understanding Lee Jung-Seob’s life and works. Based on this, it can be suggested that it is necessary to counsel to understand the development of personality types of individuals and to have a perspective of considering the importance of family and human relations. Based on these research results, the limitations of this study and suggestions for follow-up studies were included in the discussion.",김현정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108326723
한글 단어 재인에서 시각적 요인에 따른 공간주의의 영향,"In this study, we examined the effects of spatial attention in Hangul word recognition depending on visual factors. The visual complexity of words (Experiment 1) and contrast (Experiment 2) were manipulated to examine whether the effect of spatial attention differs depending on visual quality. Participants responded to words with and without codas in experiment 1 and words in high-contrast and low-contrast conditions in experiment 2. The effects of spatial attention were investigated by calculating the difference in performance between the condition where spatial cues were given at the target location (valid trial) and the condition where the spatial cues were not given at the target location (invalid trial) as the cuing effects. As a result, the cuing effects were similar depending on the complexity of the words. It indicates that the effects of spatial attention were not different across the visual complexity conditions. The cuing effects were greater in the low-contrast condition than in the high-contrast condition. The greater effect of spatial attention when the contrast is low was explained as a mechanism of signal enhancement.",이고은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3128845
Emotion Recognition in Comics: The Effect of Visual Morphemes in Visual Narrative Contexts,"In comics, the term “visual morphemes” refers to one type of graphic structure that can be combined with other graphic elements to generate diverse meaning. For instance, the visual morphemes of whirlwind-shaped lines indicate confusion if they are placed above a person’s head. Prior empirical research has shown that such emotive visual morphemes do in fact help comic readers recognize the emotions of comic characters. However, there has been little evidence of the effect of emotive visual morphemes when emotion recognition is required in narrative contexts where multiple images are arranged to form a story, as opposed to when in solitary images of character-morpheme dyads. This study thus examined how emotive visual morphemes affect the identification of character’s emotions in narrative contexts consisting of three image panels. Results showed that emotion recognition was slower when the visual morphemes were not corresponding to the emotions of characters than when they were corresponding or when they were not provided at all. The findings thus add to our understanding of visual morpheme processing by providing empirical support for the emotive visual morpheme effects in the visual narrative structure.",Hyorim Han,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107864636
Language for Deep Learning: Cognitive Explorative Action Games for Teacher-Learner Interactions,"This paper explores the design of what I call explorative action games for teacher-learner interactions. I argue that explorative actions games scaffold the learner`s re-representation of knowledge in ways that facilitate higher-level thinking and deep reasoning. With reference to Weigand`s (2010) Theory of Dialogic Action Games, I introduce the minimal form of the game, which consists of the explorative and the discovery speech act pair. Both speech acts are mutually related to each other. The explorative action game thereby revolves around knowledge re-representations in terms of Chi and Ohlsson`s (2005) types of changes with special emphasis on “greater complexity”, “higher level of abstraction”, and “shifted vantage point”. I illustrate explorative action games for these types and show how they are linked to deep learning and dialogic knowledge building.",( Sebastian Feller ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108326727
"한 심리운동 전문가의 전문성 함양 과정을 통한 자기성찰 : 심리운동수업, 양성과정을 중심으로","This study is a self-reflection of a researcher, research participant, and psychomotor expert 'I', focusing on years of experience in psychomotor classes and the process of cultivating psychomotorists, as well as the process of cultivating professionalism as a psychomotorist. Through this study, various real situations experienced by ‘I’ as a psychological movement historian were expressed through confessional writing based on diaries, parent counseling diaries, advisory records, text messages, recollections, and interviews. Through this, we tried to derive factors that made this possible by focusing on meaningful growth experiences and change processes in psychomotor classes and training for psychomotorists, and to provide a clue as to what professionalism is needed for psychomotorists. The process of change of ‘I’ as a psychomotor historian deeply expressed the life of a researcher who performed classes and training courses, and talked about it by time flow from the beginning to the present as a psychomotor historian. As a result of the study, it was confirmed that the psycho-exercise class and the training process did not appear as segmented factors, but were organically connected to each other, and ‘belief and communication’ acted as the main factors at the center of the change process. And communication with Shinnum shaped my process of change in three aspects: ‘quality of class’, ‘the role of a psychomotor expert’, and ‘the changing me’. In this process, the researcher drew the results of 'what is the professionalism of a psychomotor expert' amid a desire to become an expert. Finally, based on the results of this study, I hope that the researcher's experience will be vividly delivered to the readers and resonance will occur. We discussed the implications and limitations of this study in the hope that this study will be of some help to many psycho-activists who will be looking for a future direction even at this moment.",최호정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3128854
