To this end, the study analyzed the numbers of medical institutions and beds, of nurses working in medical institutions (nurse demand), of nursing college graduates, and of available nurses (nurse supply) by regions. Solutions based on the analysis results were sought and the study found that among the regions that promoted a policy to secure regional nurses through the supply of nurses, the policy was most effective in such regions as Gyeonggi, Incheon, Ulsan, and Sejong. However, these regions have also been the ones with the lowest ratio of nurse enrollment quota increase over the past 10 years. Through this, it was confirmed that the policy to increase the admission quota of regional nursing colleges alone is not effective when it comes to securing regional nurses. Instead, it is necessary to prepare a plan to secure regional nurses by classifying areas into four different areas as follows; first, areas where an increase in the number of nursing college admissions and medical institutions is required, second, areas that require plans to utilize idle nurses, third, areas that needs to have more medical institutions with more than 300 beds, and lastly, areas that improvement in working conditions at medical institutions is required. This is how we can ensure equity in health across regions.",박소영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106912906
AI 추천 알고리즘 편향성과 규제에 관한 연구,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, user-customized AI recommendation algorithms are being used on various platforms. AI recommendation algorithms suggest content deemed of interest to users based on user history and are necessary, to a large extent, to allow ‘selection’ from a vast pool of information. As platforms offer recommendations based on user preference profiling, there are concerns that users increasingly interact only with like-minded individuals and thus fall into an echo chamber. Such a problem, combined with UGC, leads to a polarization of public opinion, caused by false facts and misinformation on common social issues such as COVID-19.
This study confirms, through experiments, that YouTube’s AI recommendation algorithm makes it difficult for users to obtain accurate information through reliable content, once they begin watching UGC containing false or unconfirmed facts, as the algorithm continues to recommend UGC of similar nature. This study also examines AI recommendation algorithms to check for AI bias and compares relevant policies and regulations in different countries.
Our analysis of regulatory proposals and guidelines on algorithms shows considerable similarity between Korea and other countries, regarding ‘user-centricity’ and ‘transparent disclosure’ of AI algorithms. And, although differences have been observed in the scope of regulation, the examined proposals and guidelines are found to be drawing influence from one another. Based on such findings, this study provides a comparative analysis of South Korea’s policies and regulatory directions for AI recommendation algorithms, considers their effects, and proposes such measures as establishing concrete guidelines and supporting user choices to solve the bias problem of AI recommendation algorithms.",김로건,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636836
수행되지 않은 과학하기와 전문가주의에 대한 도전: 1형 당뇨병 환우회의 사례,"By attempting to answer to the questions “Why was the scientific knowledge needed by type 1 diabetes patients not produced?” and “How did the Korean Type 1 Diabetes Association get undone science done?”, this study examines the values of scientific knowledge production, in which citizens take the initiative, through the concept of Undone Science. Viewing the expert-centered health care system as an obstacle to the growth of scientific knowledge and technology for type 1 diabetes management, the Korean Type 1 Diabetes Association actively introduced and improved medical devices developed by oversea patient groups, and produced patient-led diabetes-related data. These activities of the Type 1 Diabetes Association have developed beyond scientific knowledge production into a social movement aimed at an alternative society of patient-centered care. Meanwhile, patient-led data produced by Type 1 Diabetes Association through civic hacking has become a key tool for them to negotiate and be recognized for their expertise in type 1 diabetes. The value of medical data measured through digital medical devices, which are rapidly emerging in medical science as guiding the future of medical science, also provided them with an opportunity structure to challenge to the expert-centered medical research systems.",차민경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106993164

AI 반도체 산업의 기술발전 방향과 후발자의 추격 가능성에 대한 고찰 : 미국 특허를 이용한 기술수명주기 분석을 중심으로,"With the advent of the 4th industrial revolution, new technologies is receiving attention. These are technologies that can change our lives, such as big data, AR/XR, IoT, and autonomous vehicles. These technologies are used more efficiently when combined with AI. Therefore, based on the existing literature on AI semiconductor, which is the core for the AI technology, we have classified AI semiconductors as three types such as the 1st generation(CPU and GPU), 2nd generation(FPGA, APIC and Neural), and 3rd generation(Neuromorphic). With the classification, we collected the patent data and analyzed that whether a window of opportunity exists for latecomers. The results are as follows. First, the amount of the AI semiconductor patents increases steadily, and the growth rate has risen sharply after 2018. Second, the relative technological cycle time of the 3rd generation is shorter than that of the 1st and 2nd generations, and the gap is high in recent years. Third, from the perspective of the window of opportunity, a shorter cycle time means that it is less reliance on existing technologies and using more new technologies. Using less existing technology means that the incumbents and the latecomers are on the same starting line at the time of technological paradigm shift. The technical field of 1st and 2nd generation AI semiconductors on the extension line of existing technologies have difficulties in entering the market for latecomers. However, since the 3rd generation presents a new technological paradigm that utilizes a technology similar to the human brain, the market potentials is high even if the technological level is still insufficient. In other words, in the case of 3rd generation, as a competitive market where there is no dominant incumbents yet, the window of opportunity for latecomers is wide opened.",이종호,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108173668

국민건강보험공단 빅데이터를 통해 본 연명의료중단등결정의 이행 현황,"With the enactment of the Act on Determination of Life-Sustaining Treatment and the revision of its Enforcement Decree in 2016, the scope of end-of-life life-sustaining treatment was established as a legal term in South Korea. Based on the Act, decisions on life-sustaining treatment can be made and implementation of that decisions can be proceeded. Therefore, it is possible to quantitatively trace life-sustaining treatment decisions occurring in Korea through national data sources such as health insurance data. This research uses the National Health Insurance Service health screening cohort data base from 2018 to 2019, when a pilot project on life-sustaining treatment decisions was conducted, extracting data from people who made decisions such as forgoing life-sustaining treatment. As a nested case-control study, a case group and a control group were compared and their characteristics and medical practices were analyzed. After the extraction, the case group had a higher ratio of males, a younger age of 75.1 years, and a higher percentage of intensive care unit admission than the control group. The case group and the control one showed differences in residence, income level, degree of disability, cause of death, place of death, intensive care unit admission, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Death due to neoplasms, diseases of blood and hematopoietic organs and specific disorders invading the immune mechanism, death in a tertiary hospital, and CCI of 3 or higher were the highest in the case group. When 1,123 patients in the case group and 1,123 patients in the control group were compared after matching, there were statistically significant differences between two groups in terms of CPR, ventilator support, and use of vasopressors both 6 months before and 1 month before the death. The results of this study suggest that the Act on Determination of Life-Sustaining Treatment has only a limited effect on end-of-life care. Follow-up studies that directly track the current status of end-of-life care and quality of life are needed.",김정아,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107966207
