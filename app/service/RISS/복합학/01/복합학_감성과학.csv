Also, realizing art of daily life is intertwined with the attitudes and quality of life of the learners, and further extends its influences to communities and society as a whole. The suggestions for art & cultural education’s orientations are as follows. First, various programs should be carried out both inside and outside school to foster the aesthetic sense of teachers. Second, practical art & cultural education at a community level should be encouraged so it can be learned as an experience rather than function and knowledge.",권희원,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108713276

OTT 시대의 영화 다양성에 관한 시론적 논의,"The emergence of OTT, a new media based on the universal Internet, is bringing many changes to cinema. Against this background, this study discusses how film diversity can be sustained in the new phase created by OTT. Film diversity has been an important topic in the literature in relation to the artistic and social value of films. However, most OTT studies have focused on business and technology, and only a few have addressed film diversity. In this study, we reviewed the notable features of OTT from the perspective of cultural diversity and specifically investigated the aspects of film diversity in the OTT environment that have not been explored in previous studies. As a result, we found two things about the relationship between OTT and film diversity. First, film diversity in OTT may be practiced in connection with the industry logic of content differentiation. Second, the long-tail effect of OTT has a positive impact on film diversity. The long tail refers to the commercial value of niche products that are favored by a small number of people in online-based businesses, which is why OTTs offer more films with specific tastes. This trend is leading to the emergence of OTTs that specialize in certain films, such as independent films, documentaries, and women's films. Film diversity is also a political value, as it challenges social and cultural exclusion in cinema and seeks novelty in subject matter and form. According to Benjamin, who noted the political function of art in the age of technological reproduction, cinematic art, which is inherently tied to technology, is inherently political. Therefore, this study's discussion of cinema and cinematic diversity, which is changing under the influence of new technologies, can lead to a discussion of the nature of cinema in the 21st century.",성진수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60089383

디지털 시대 예술교육의 새로운 방향을 위한 탐색적 연구,"Rapid progression into a digital society in the 21st century has meant that the center of discourses regarding future education has shifted towards digital literacy and capabilities. Indeed, the strong preference shown by Generation Z toward new media indicates the emergence of completely different ways of social interactions and communication than ever before. This study proposes ‘Arts with Humanities in Education' as one of the arts education discourses with the capacity to efficiently contribute to the development of literacy and relevant capabilities for a digital era. The notion of ‘Arts with Humanities in Education' inherits and furthers the discourse of Martha C. Nussbaum, who emphasizes the liberal arts education as a crucial part of future education. Following on from this, this study argues ‘Arts with Humanities in Education' aims toward the realization of “imagination of praxis” through the signification of arts activities that are characterized by dialogic aesthetic experiences. On the basis of the theoretical analysis toward new directions for arts education in a digital era, this study reviews an exemplary of “Arts Together,” a program that has been organized and successfully implemented in 2018 by SFAC(Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture) as part of the regular school curriculum across 103 middle schools in Seoul, and explores the possibility of ‘Arts with Humanities in Education' as a new practice of arts education in school.",임미혜,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60089395

번역 학습자를 위한 한·중 번역 사례 연구 : 대학 행정 용어를 중심으로,"The purpose of this study is to accurately express university administrative terms that are difficult to translate into both languages with different administrative systems and language habits of Korea and China. To this end, we examined how actual Korean language learners translate university institution and position terms through translation text.
The results confirmed that the most learners could not accurately grasp the meaning of university administrative terms written in Chinese characters and translate directly or incorrectly. For correct translation, We should grasp the meaning of the source language and the target language, and then obtain the correct expression through comparative analysis.
Through this point, this study attempts to present the following points to Korean learners in the process of translation education in Korean. First, it is necessary to make efforts to find words that are easy to understand and accurate to the target language reader in the translation process. Before translating, it is important to read the meaning of the entire text sentence, not the word. Second, be careful about the interference phenomenon of Chinese characters. It is necessary to understand and learn by contrasting similarities and differences in the meaning and usage of Chinese characters between Korean and Chinese.
The regrettable thing is that as the portal site's translation function has recently improved, foreign language learners have been enjoying using it, but they have not been able to compare and explain machine translation and learner translation.
