To this end, cases of writing classes using ChatGPT were analyzed and the survey on learners' perceptions was conducted. In the liberal arts course of A university in Korea, an essay writing activity using ChatGPT was performed after subject-specific reading. A total of 62 learners decided on the guidelines related to the use of ChatGPT through discussion before writing the essay. From an analysis of the results after writing, text citation, prompt input, source verification, and revision were found, and educational implications were derived. In the subsequent survey, more than half of the learners positively recognized ChatGPT as a tool for saving writing time and improving process efficiency. It was also revealed that ChatGPT was most frequently used for idea generation and information gathering. However, learners pointed out problems concerning the quality, source, and credibility of the information. Therefore, education on the reinforcement ability to compare, contrast, judge, and synthesize information from various sources should be strengthened. In addition, clear and specific writing ethics standards and guidelines for the use of ChatGPT must be provided. This study has value as an empirical study using ChatGPT in college liberal arts writing activities.",오선경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636724

촉법소년 연령 하향으로 인한 문제점에 대한 대응방안,"The Ministry of Justice is pushing for a revision of the Criminal Law and Juvenile Law to lower the age of criminal minors from under 14 to under 13 to deal with 70 percent of criminal minors who have been protected due to intelligence, brutality, increased crime, and abuse of punishment.
Academia is at odds with lowering the age of criminal minors, and lawyers' groups for a democratic society, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea, and the National Assembly Legislative Investigation Office are opposed. However, according to a survey of 3,506 adult men and women conducted by Media Real Research Korea in June 2022, 80.2% agreed. As such, most people express their approval for lowering the age of criminal minors.
If the age of criminal minors is forced to be lowered at the request of the majority of the people, it should be implemented in a way to minimize the stigma damage caused by punishment. The stigma caused by criminal punishment makes it difficult to adapt to society, making it impossible to live a normal social life, making it impossible to break the vicious circle of crime and leading to recidivism.
The ways to minimize stigma damage due to punishment are to postpone criminal records, exclude arrest investigations, suspend middle school graduation conditions, and implement vacation detention systems to prevent infringement of learning rights, and establish a third correctional facility to prevent recidivism.",이동임,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108402591

MZ세대에 대한 대중감성 연구: 소셜미디어(SNS) 감성 분석을 통해,"In this study, the public sensitivity of the 'MZ generation' was examined through the social media big data sensitivity analysis method. For the analysis, the consumer account SNS text was examined, and positive and negative emotional factors were presented by classifying external sensibilities and emotions of the MZ generation. In conclusion, the positive emotions of liking and interest in relation to the ""MZ generation"" were 72.1%, higher than the negative emotional ratio of 27.9%. In positive sensitivity, the older generation showed 'a favorable feeling for the individuality and dignifiedness of the MZ generation' and 'interest in the MZ generation with new values'. In contrast, the MZ generation has a favorable feeling for ‘the fact that they are a generation of their own boldness, youthfulness and individuality’ and ‘small growthism’. Negative sensitivity outside the MZ generation was found to be ‘A concern about the marriage avoidance, employment difficulties, debt investment, and resignation trends of the MZ generation’, 'Hate the MZ generation who treats Kkondae' and ‘Difficult to talk to the MZ generation’. On the other hand, the negative emotions felt by the MZ generation itself were ‘Rejection of generalization’, ‘Rejection of generation and gender conflicts’, ‘Rejection of competition worse than the older generation’, ‘Relative failure of the rich era’, and ‘Sadness to live in a predicted climate disaster’. Therefore, the older generation should not look at the MZ generation in general, but as individuals, and should alleviate conflicts with intergenerational understanding and empathy. there is a need for community consideration to solve generational conflicts, gender conflicts, and environmental problems.",안명숙,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108460667

의학에서 인공지능 도입의 현재와 미래,"The Alpha Go event of 2016 reflects today's feelings mixed with anxiety and anticipation about Artificial intelligence(AI). AI was about only to mimic a single human nerve, but now it has reached a level that can simulate a human neural network. As computing power increases exponentially, AI has become more applicable and has entered the medical field. If the accuracy of the AI based diagnosis is higher than that of the human, the possibility of transferring the authority of diagnosis from human to AI based diagnosis is likely to be the choice of the Evidence Based Medicine. Furthermore, when the diagnosis or treatment of AI proves to be superior or more accurate than a human physician, the normative level of the physician's duty of care will change. If so, will AI be perceived as a human being or a subject of medical practice? It will be a question whether AI can become a legal entity that can be responsible for the wrongdoing. In the case of automobiles in which modern technology is integrated and operated in a complex way, even if problems arise in the process of intelligent work that is based on decision making, the service or automobile is not responsible for the accident on its own. In other words, if the machine does not know exactly what the human will is, or if the machine can not perform correctly, the responsibility for the accident is mainly the manufacturer. It is difficult to define intelligence as it is now, and it is more difficult and ambiguous to define AI. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain logical persuasiveness in discussing the legal subjecthood of AI in the current state. On the other hand, the benefits expected from the introduction of AI medicine include avoiding human error, reducing costs, improving quality of care, and preventing health inequalities. However, as long as AI will bring more light into the future, its shadow can also become darker. As the spread of artificial intelligence dissemination, layperson who do not know programming will be able to participate in patching and spreading of fake information, and wrong medical information can be spread more easily and quickly through AI service. In addition, though the things, such as medical care, nursing, filling prescription or medication instruction, that are regarded as only human being can do are done by AI, and if it is hard to distinguish by whom it has been done, then the mutual relationship of human being and its value will inevitably weakened. Furthermore, AI still remains at the level of simulating some functions of human intelligence, if AI become similar to the god of self existence and controls human life with its free will, we need to reconsider whether it is right to continue to develop these technologies.",동재준,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106018516
생성 AI와 AI 창작물 저작권에 대한 사용자의 인식 연구: 사용자 그룹의 차이를 중심으로,"Generative AI systems are expected to be more widely utilized. However, relatively little attention has been paid to understanding how users perceive and accept generative AI results. To identify strategies for increasing the future use of generative AI and prepare for potential issues, we organized design workshop for the general user group and the designer group. They created artwork utilizing Novel AI and semi-structured interview was followed to evaluate their attitudes toward generative AI and its copyright. Results indicate that the general public views generative AI positively, while the design-related group views it quite negatively. The participants expressed concerns as to the misuse the system, specifically related to copyright issues. People who are likely to utilize generative AI outcomes have insisted more strongly that copyrights should be their own. Those working in the design field highly evaluated the possibility of using generative AI in their work.

윤리적이고 주체적인 글쓰기를 위한 지도 방안 연구－ 글쓰기 윤리 교육의 새로운 패러다임에 관한 모색,"Nowadays the majority of the university in Korea have opened writing classes as a compulsory subject and writing ethics became the essential chapter of it. But still many students made plagiarism with or Without dishonest intentions, and they seem to have difficulties to make innocent sentences when they quoted reference materials It’s because they only have been taught they must keep writing ethics, and nobody explains how to avoid it. So we should teach how to write ethically, as well as how to avoid plagiarism. This thesis give focus on the feasibility of writing ethics.
We can find 3 reasons for students’ doing dishonest behavior on writings, which are unethical intentions, careless writing, and bad manner for information on the internet. Among them, carelessness is the major reason for plagiarism. It means it could be very difficult to practice writing ethically, especially for students who are poor at writing. And we’ve known that Just learning the art of annotation and quotation isn't enough to conduct writing ethics. So the reminding writing ethics and teaching writing skill must run in parallel. In this thesis, we suggest various solutions for 3 cases.
First, unexpressive students with no sense of their theme require reading training and sentences practice together with learning quotation technique. Second, students with poor judgment need an ap propriate information retrieval in company with paraphrasing and summarization of it. Third, group activities are proved effectual for students with passive attitude toward learning, and in this case it is more important to encourage students to feel confident about it.
An incomplete understanding cannot draw to carry it into practice. So the aims to educate for writing ethics must be changed into concrete and empirical. Essence for teaching writing ethics need to shift from technique toward sensibility. We suggest Dignity and Collective Intelligence for new paradigms for instruction of ethical writing. Also it cannot be too useful to make various ethics-educational programs both inside and outside the writing class.",김지연,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105323397

There are many prior studies on the solitary death of elderly people living alone, but there are still many studies that have not been done yet on the solitary death issue. In this study, we intend to investigate the characteristics of human relationships and the concepts and causes of solitary death in relation to solitary death, and analyze the present situation and problems. Methods : This study aims to conduct a literature study on possible approaches from the police, fire fighting, and related agencies through an analysis of the contents related to the prevention of solitary death. Conclusion : This study found that the Act on the Prevention of Solitary Death was a structure that was quite difficult to find for the role of police and fire fighting because many aspects of the Act were linked to securing a social safety net and responding aspects at the social welfare level. However, it is noteworthy that the basic content of preparing statistics and grasping the situation for the prevention of solitary death and death was presented in connection with police and fire fighting. First, in terms of tallying and managing the death toll at the National Police Agency, it is appropriate to prepare the statistics through a magazine investigating the dead. Second, they found people living alone and suggested the importance of cooperating with police, government officials, fire fighters and emergency services during the rescue phase. This study is intended to suggest the following. First, currently in a solitary death network, most analyses have many statistical or medical approaches to occurrence. Given this, it is necessary to consider the direction of the police's use of the coroner's staff to build up statistical data from the initial stage. Second, in a similar form to the cases of improving the national statistical infrastructure related to suicide, it is necessary for the Health and Welfare Ministry, the National Police Agency and the National Statistical Office to be utilized in policy making through the establishment and production of a solitary death statistical infrastructure by pan-government cooperation.",구효송,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106361127

ChatGPT를 활용한 중학교 영어 자유 작문 개별화 수업 설계,"This study implies that instructional design in rapidly changing technological environments can be swiftly achieved with ChatGPT's help, suggesting changes in the roles of teachers and instructional designers in the era of generative Artificial Intelligence. This research paper presents a comprehensive lesson plan for middle school English free writing classes utilizing ChatGPT. The study encompasses three main phases: initial collaboration between an instructional designer and ChatGPT to create an individualized lesson plan, a usability test conducted with a first-year male student using the drafted plan, and subsequent revisions and improvements based on the test results. The research findings highlight two significant outcomes. Firstly, by engaging in free writing activities that involved interacting with ChatGPT and asking questions to favorite movie characters, the student demonstrated enhanced interest, confidence, and fluency in English writing. This suggests that integrating ChatGPT in middle school English free writing activities has the potential to improve computer-mediated communication effectiveness, content-based instruction teaching efficacy, and accessibility to free writing for low-level learners. Secondly, the study emphasizes the importance of thoughtful lesson planning to avoid excessive dependence on ChatGPT's automatic sentence generation. To address this concern, the revised lesson plan incorporates paired oral activities, metacognitive-related tasks utilizing KWL charts, mandatory modifications of ChatGPT-generated sentences, and opportunities for students to practice writing letters by hand without ChatGPT assistance. Overall, this study showcases how instructional design, in response to rapidly changing technological environments, can be effectively accomplished with the assistance of ChatGPT, indicating potential shifts in the roles of teachers and lesson planning strategies with the integration of ChatGPT in the classroom.",이채욱,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636081

한국형 분노범죄의 원인과 대응방안에 관한 연구,"On April 17, 2019, a man in his forties intentionally set fire to his apartment in Jinju, South Gyeongsang Province and randomly swung knives at the residents trying to escape. Five people died and thirteen were injured. The majority of the victims were weak people, such as children, women, and elders, and most journalists reported that it was a so-called 'motiveless crime,' which often targets an unspecified number of the general public. The number of anger-based murder cases caused by dissatisfaction with the reality as well as inadvertently is annually on the increase and the people feel a greater sense of insecurity; this study aimed to conceptualize and categorize crimes of passion correctly, prevent them, and present effective countermeasures against them.
A crime of passion was once defined as a crime committed by individuals who fail to contain anger, have a fit of anger even at trivial things, and are dissatisfied with social realities. However, it has not been clearly defined but been conceptualized as a motiveless crime, a random crime, or a crime committed by those having mental illness, such as schizophrenia; the absence of consistent causes and countermeasures and the difficulty in building an inter-institution cooperation system prevent us from coping well with those crimes.
This study defined all of the crimes caused by the lack of ability to control emotions, the random crimes based on the tendency toward abnormal motives, and the crimes caused by mental illness as Korean-style crimes of passion and carried out case analyses to determine the causes of each crime of passion and characterize it. Efforts were made to make these crimes of passion recognized as social problems, build a safety net at the national level, take countermeasures of preventing crimes and second convictions, and reinforce inter-institution connection with the objective of coping with the crimes. In addition, an alternative was presented by introducing a virtual-reality program for anger control to use special imaging technology to provide a virtual world and cultivate anger control and social skills in a therapeutic way.
Korean-style crimes of passion have gone beyond the acceptable scope for individuals because of the diversified society and the presence of personal stressors. It is essential to take a social countermeasure against the anger expressed in extreme forms. It is therefore necessary to form a consultative body at the national level and take effective countermeasures.",이은영,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106173175
