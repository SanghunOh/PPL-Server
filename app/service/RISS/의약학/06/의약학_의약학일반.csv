I argue that somatic genome-editing therapies should be regulated in the same way as other gene therapies, that the regulations should be individualized in light of the advantages and disadvantages of each technology, and that these regulations should be multiphased such that the risk-benefit analysis at each stage should be taken into account in deciding whether to proceed to the next stage of research. Furthermore, I argue that the current regulation of research on redundant human embryos from in vitro fertilization (IVF) should be revised, that new regulations on the gene editing of human eggs and sperms should be set up, that gene-editing research on relevant somatic cells and animal models should precede preclinical studies on heritable human gene editing, and that the results of preclinical studies should be taken into account in considering whether to allow clinical trials of human germline editing. I conclude by calling for regulations on human genome editing for enhancement and describing the role of Korea’s National Bioethics Committee in reforming existing regulations.",김현섭,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105305885
중환자실 간호사가 경험한 심폐소생술금지 환자의 윤리적 문제에 대한 윤리적 의사결정,"This article reports on a study that was carried out to document and understand the experiences that nurses in intensive care units in South Korea have when dealing with Do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders.
The participants in the study were 13 intensive care units nurses, each of whom has at least four years of relevant experience with ethical decision-making concerning DNR orders. Data analysis was based on the content analysis method used in qualitative research. The study found that the ethical values of nurses concerning the treatment and death of patients with DNR orders are not fixed but rather change according to the patient’s situation. This result indicates that it is necessary to provide clearer guidelines for decisions regarding patient care in the context of DNR orders. In addition, further education or training programs concerning DNR orders should be provided to nurses working in intensive care units in South Korea.",장재인,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106385516
인공지능로봇의료의 도덕형이상학적 모색: 의료적 전자인간의 책임가능성,"The European Parliament is currently considering a proposal to grant artificial intelligence (AI) robots the legal status of “electronic persons”. This article examines the metaphysical status of AI robots and considers the some of the ethical questions that arise from the use of AI robots in the practice of medicine. In particular, would electronic human doctors have rights? And to what extent could they be held responsible for their behavior? In answering these questions this article considers the concept of a “kill switch” and how it relates to the notion of freedom that is presupposed by a Kantian understanding of responsibility. The article also outlines some of the new horizons opened up by the arrival of Watson in medicine, including the emergence of “self-care medicine” and the possibility of “universal self-care.” This article argues that in light of the advent of electronic human doctors, the new role for human health care personnel is that of a “kill switcher.”",정창록,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430450

Following the methodology of Arksey and O’Malley, we conducted a scoping review of articles published (in either English or Korean) within the last 10 years that focus on educational interventions for critical care nurses concerning End-Of-Life care. The following domains were abstracted from the collected data: study design, program details, program evaluation, and results. A total 15 studies were extracted and reviewed. The predominant educational approach in these studies was competency enhancement education. The teaching methods employed included lectures, demonstrations, simulations, role-play, workshops, discussions, mentoring, and online training. Most of the educational program evaluations measured changes in knowledge, attitude, or confidence levels related to various aspects of End-Of- Life care, including communication with patients, legal considerations, ethical decision-making, and symptoms management. This study suggests that educational interventions can improve the End-Of-Life care provided by critical care nurses, and future research should target programs aimed at enhancing the relevant skills and competencies of these nurses.",한유진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108764441

Many hope that AI will remove constraints on human and material resources and bring innovations in diagnosis and treatment. However, the deep learning techniques and resulting black box problem of AI raise important ethical concerns. To address these concerns, this article explores some of the relevant ethical domains, issues, and themes in this area and proposes principles to guide use of AI in healthcare. Three ethical themes are identified, including respect for person, accountability, and sustainability, which correspond to the three domains of data acquisition, clinical setting, and social environment. These themes and domains were schematized with detailed explanations of relevant ethical issues, concepts, and applications, such as explainability and accountability.

베이비 박스의 도덕성 논쟁,"There was dispute on ‘baby box’ in the second half of 2011. In 2009, clergyman, Lee Jong-rak made a baby box on church wall. Actually, 26 new born babies were abandoned in the ‘baby box’. The babies who had disability were thrown out from the unmarried mothers with letters. If there was no baby box,the babies could die by hypothermia in the cold weather. But Ministry of health and welfare, and Gwanak Ward Office are requesting to remove baby box because it is illegal for non-authorized facility to look after baby. Baby box was installed to prevent from abandonment of baby in cold weather and risk.
But it is on dispute between ‘protection of infant’ and ‘encouragement of abandonment’. Like dispute surrounding abortion or contraception, baby box is a complicated problem and it is not easy to conclude.
It is a difficult subject that anybody cannot judge awkwardly. This is because the subject is related to human life. This thesis tried to evaluate this problem from ethical view. First, contradictory views are reviewed - the views are if baby box is for encouragement of abandonment, or if it is for protection of infant. Second, this problem is investigated from positions of Deontology and Teleology which are representative views of ethics. And this paper applies principles of modern medical ethics from the dispute to evaluate the problem.

동물실험 교육과정에서 윤리교육 강화의 필요성에 관한 연구,"The biggest debate in the field of animal ethics revolves around animal experimentation. Various discussions surround experiments on animal subjects, and considerations of the animal’s scope or the animal subject’s treatment method, experimental method etc. differ for each individual situation. The majority of those against the use of animal subjects in laboratories are cleared of anthropocentrism in order to fundamentally evaluate the justification of animal experimentation and demand efforts in improving experimental methods and processes while minimizing the animal subject’s sacrifice and suffering. In laboratory, animal experiments are different from regular experiments because they involve the treatment of animal life. Because this context may create ethical conflicts, the researchers who implement experiments on animals must receive the appropriate training so that they can recognize this distinctiveness. However, if we examine the current training under animal experimentation, even university curriculums have barely developed this type of training and, what is worse, the part of the government that regulates animal experimentation provides little training in animal ethics. To counter balance negative awareness about animal experimentation, we must increase the utility of such experiments and diffuse awareness of animal welfare. We must strengthen training in animal ethics to create a peaceful coexistence between nature and humankind.",유동미,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104538479

However, there are few such committees and their operations have been limited in many respects. In this article we report on a survey that was carried out to assess the difficulties faced by 63 committee administrators. We also conducted focus-group interviews with seven medical professionals or administrators working in health care institutions in which a committee has been established. Subjects were asked about the difficulties these committees face in advising on foregoing life-sustaining treatment. The operational problems that were reported include the following: difficulties in accessing patients’ records of decisions concerning life-sustaining treatment, obstacles in using Shared Ethics Committees, legal and administrative complexities in diagnosing the end-of-life process, the lack of expertise of committee members and administrators, manpower shortages on the committees, and medical professionals’ negative views of the Act’s procedures for life-sustaining treatment decision-making. In order to deal with these problems, we suggest the following solutions: improving the accessibility of patients’ life-sustaining treatment decisions, encouraging the use of Shared Ethics Committees, defining the qualifications and training requirements for Committee members, establishing better communications among committee members; creating an educational system for medical professionals in order to improve their understanding of the committees’ role; and developing standard operating procedures for the committees.",최지연,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106385458

무엇이 과잉진료를 부추기는가?: 과잉진료의 원인 고찰과 대책,"Overtreatment (or unnecessary treatment) occurs when medical services are provided with a higher volume or cost than is appropriate. Of course, practicing good medicine and avoiding unnecessary harm have always been principles of medical practice. Currently there is a new emphasis on reducing practices that are likely to have limited benefit or that involve potential harm. Waste due to overtreatment has been described as a violation of the principle of justice on the assumption that every system has limited resources and any wasted resource necessarily means those resources will no longer be available for use by others in need. Overtreatment may also cause direct harm to patients, thus violating the principle of nonmaleficence. Physicians are rarely motivated by the desire to achieve system efficiency or to save money for its own sake. However, it is widely understood that physicians should be motivated by a desire to do the right thing in terms of promoting the patient’s best interest. And doing the right thing includes an ethical imperative to provide parsimonious care. Recognizing this fact helps to bridge the enormous quality chasm that still exists between the medical care that is currently provided and the medical care that should be provided.

회복 불가능한 환자의 심폐소생술포기(DNR)와 관련된 윤리문제,"The following research has examined ethical dilemmas regarding denial of resuscitation by patients. The articlealso suggests several proposals for optimized solutions. First of all, the history and nature of CPR & DNR have been discussed. Second, mutual interactions during making decisions on DNR have been introduced. Because physicians do not exclusively conduct the decision on DNR, patients, family members, and other related siblings should be involved in the process. If necessary, the ethics committee may be applied for making appropriate decisions. Thirdly, in order to locate the nature of ethical dilemma on DNR decisions, the relationship between patients and physicians, full understanding the importance of CPR necessity, and defining the method of DNR would need to be well explained. Finally, through the ethical discussion on DNR, following conclusions have been suggested. In all situations, DNR must let physicians make decision on futility of CPR for patients` current or future conditions, and the decision must be made only after patients are fully aware of the consequences. Under the law of respecting patients` opinions, patients must have the ability to make decisions on DNR. The proper moments for deciding DNR should depend on behaviors regarding his/her conditions or diseases. Because a health care institution play an important role in making decisions as well, all opinions must be reviewed for the best outcome. It is important to remember that the main decision makers on DNR are patients. Following discussions have concluded that an agreement among people nationwide is quite essential for the appropriate DNR decisions.

The present study, which addresses this gap in existing research, reexamined the in-depth interview data collected from family members caring for terminal cancer patients. The data was analyzed using a phenomenological methodology with a view to uncovering the aspects of anticipatory grief that are present in the social and cultural context of South Korea. Study participants tended to avoid exposing their grief to the dying family member and to ignore the imminent death. In the process of palliative care, they expressed existential, emotional, and relational dimensions of grief. Some of the study participants reported that in the process of caring for a sick family member, changes arose in their perception of, and attitudes toward, life and death. In addition, the study found significant aspects of the anticipatory grief in that participants also received comfort from their relationship with the dying family member, and they expressed strong feelings of resentment toward, and dissatisfaction with, the attending physicians. It is hoped that these findings will contribute to more informed approaches to death education for patients, their family members, and physicians.",장원경,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107713971
태아성감별행위 및 고지금지법 폐지의 필요성,"South Korea’s Medical Service Act of 1987 prohibits medical personnel from conducting diagnostic tests on pregnant woman for the purpose of predicting the sex of the fetus. This provision of the Medical Service Act was originally adopted to prevent sex-specific births and a gender imbalance in Korea, given the preference for sons that was common in Korean society at that time. Since it was first enacted, the contents and related penalties for this law have been revised. As of 2016, medical personnel who attempt fetal sex prediction before 32 weeks gestation are subject to having their license suspended for one year and being imprisoned for up to two years. Within the past decade, gains in women’s socioeconomic status in Korea have decreased or eliminated the long-standing cultural preference for sons. As a result, artificial interventions for the purpose of sex-specific births have almost disappeared. In a survey conducted in 2018, 97.7% of cases artificial abortion were performed in cases under 16 weeks gestation, when the sex of the fetus was unknown. In the case of genetic diseases, such as X chromosome-related diseases, it is medically necessary to determine the sex of the fetus. In the current context, in which the crime of abortion has been abolished in Korea, the remaining prohibition on fetal sex prediction is irrational. This article argues for abolishing Korea’s prohibition on fetal sex prediction both because there are legitimate medical needs for determining the sex of a fetus and because the original purpose of the law no longer exists, given the significant social changes that have taken place in Korean society since 1987.",정창환,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107859334

혈액투석환자의 사전연명의료의향서 작성 영향요인,"The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence Hemodialysis patients’ in-tentions to write Advanced Directives (ADs). A questionnaire was used to collect data from 165 chronic renal failure patients receiving hemodialysis treatment at two general hospitals in South Korea. The variables that were found to have a significant influence on the intention to write an AD were education level, knowledge of Ads, and attitudes toward ADs. Patients with a university degree or high school education were significantly more likely (3.35 times and 3.62 times, respec-tively) to write an AD than were those without a high school education. In terms of knowledge of ADs, as the score increased by 1 point out of 21, the intention to write an AD increased by 1.12 times. Regarding attitudes toward ADs, as the score increased by 1 point, the intention to write an AD increased by 1.13 times. Patients that would choose to continue dialysis treatment during the end-of-life period were less willing to write an AD than those who would stop the dialysis treatment. However, 18.5% of those willing to write an AD indicated that they would continue hemodialysis treatment during the end-of-life period. The results of this study suggest that discus-sions between patients, family members, and healthcare providers are required from the beginning of dialysis treatment so that these patients have the right knowledge and attitudes about ADs and can confirm their values and beliefs about end-of-life care.",손은성,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108280210

For this study a cross-sectional survey was carried out on 300 nurses recruited from six hospitals in South Korea. The endogenous and exogenous variables of this hypothetical model on moral courage were years of clinical experience, nursing organizational culture, humanism, and compassion. Data were collected from April to June, 2017, and analyzed with SPSS 20.0 and AMOS 22.0. The model showed a good fit: χ2/df=2.79, goodness of fit index (GFI)=.95, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=.08, standardized root meansquared residual (SRMR)=.04, Tucker-Lewis index (TLI)=.90, comparative fit index (CFI)=.94, Parsimonious Normed of Fit Index (PNFI)=.60. All the explanatory variables for moral courage were statistically significant. Relationship-innovation oriented organizational culture was indirectly significant.
The variables explained 43% of moral courage. The results of this study support the establishment of a body of nursing knowledge based on a model of moral courage as a concept of nursing practice domain. Effective strategies for promoting moral courage in nursing practice include relationshipinnovation oriented organizational cultures and the training of nurses in moral competency through working experience.",문숙자,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106494152

It is, moreover, expected that the research result will go far toward groping for retraining program of professional instructors for the desirable physical activity education as well as the improvement of the early childhood physical activity education program.
In this research, 320 early childhood education institutions located in Seoul and Kyeonggi area have been selected as objects of questionnaire and the data have analyzed with frequency using a SPSS program.
The result of the research is as follow:
1. The survey on the early childhood physical activity education shows that the purpose of the physical activity program is firstly perception improvement, secondly the character and sociality building, and thirdly their physique and physical strength training. The main contents of the program, therefore, is also related to the development of perception as well as character, sociality, physique, and physical strength training. The program mostly consists of fundamental physical activity such as exercise or game along with perception exercise program. The field where the program takes place is mostly nearby playground or classroom The class of the physical activity education is usually offered once or twice a week and 30 to 40 minutes a time. Most of time there is one instructor in a classroom during a lesson and the class size is 10 to 20. The instructors prefer basic activity, perception excercise program, and programs like fencing or Tae-kwondo.
2. The survey shows that many of the object early childhood education institutions do not carry out extra auricular program related to physical activity.

간호대학생의 도덕적 용기에 대한 도덕적 고뇌와 도덕적 민감성의 관계,"Nursing students experience ethical conflicts that lead to moral distress and moral sensitivity in clinical practice. Most nursing students have some difficulty in speaking up when faced with morally challenging situations. Hence, increasing moral courage of these students is important to improve the quality of prac-tice, and carry out nursing responsibilities. However, research on the moral distress, moral sensitivity, and moral courage of nursing students has not been reported in South Korea. The purposes of this study were to (a) identify the levels of moral distress, moral sensitivity, and moral courage of nursing students and (b) examine the influence of moral distress and moral sensitivity on moral courage. Data were collected through a survey using self-reported questionnaires sent to senior nursing students at two nursing col-leges in Seoul and Gyeonggido. A total of 138 senior nursing students participated in the survey. The data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23 program by Pearson’s correlation coefficients and multiple regression analysis. The mean scores of the moral distress thermometer, moral distress, moral sensitivity, and moral courage were 3.53±2.18, 57.33±43.35, 134.98±13.98, and 56.33±12.75, respectively. The significant factors influencing moral courage were the moral distress thermometer and patient-centered nursing, which was a subcomponent of moral sensitivity. The explanatory power of the model was 5%. This study confirms that nursing students, like nurses, experience moral distress. It is therefore important to create organizational environments that support the moral courage of nursing students.",윤혜영,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105981458

Relevant reports were searched from databases including PubMed, Cochrane library, and JoannaBriggs Institute with key words regarding clinical ethics. Finally, 50 articles published between 2002 and 2012 were selected. It was found that most of the existing research was empirical with descriptive study designs. Over 60% of this research focused on nurses as research subjects. Only two interventional studies were retrieved. Major concepts related to clinical ethics support services were ethical dilemmas, ethical issues, and ethical decision-making.

임신중절에 관한 드워킨의 가치 논변 연구,"Abortion raises two distinct but related ethical issues: one concerns the moral status of a fetus; the other concerns the conflict between the rights of a fetus and those of a pregnant woman. While conservatives claim that a fetus has a right to life, which outweighs a woman’s right to bodily autonomy, liberals who support abortion rights focus rather on the meaning of pregnancy for women. Dworkin argues against both the liberal and the conservative views, claiming that each is inconsistent with our considered moral judgements. He claims that a fetus has, not rights, but rather intrinsic value, and different views on the intrinsic value of fetal life give rise to different views on the morality of abortion. This argument from Dworkin, which I call the “value-argument,” is critically examined in this essay. While the value-argument helps to explain our considered moral judgements concerning abortion and integrates the two aforementioned problems into one, the “intrinsic value problem,” it fails to resolve the ethical problem of abortion. Rather than justifying its central claim that a fetus has some intrinsic value, Dworkin presupposes it as a working hypothesis. Nor does he provide objective criteria for evaluating the intrinsic value of a fetus. As such, Dworkin does not present a unique position on the ethics of abortion but rather explains why differences of opinion concerning abortion arise. This critical examination of the value-argument concludes that rather than solving the moral problem of abortion Dworkin merely provides an analysis of it.",김상득,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105928758

Covid-19 팬데믹에서의 간호윤리: 돌봄의 윤리적 관점에서,"The ethic of care in nursing presupposes a narrative understanding of patients in vulnerable situations. This ethic has both has both reciprocal and protective ethical dimensions. The ethics of reciprocity guides the relationship between nurses and patients such that each influences the other toward a good life and thereby helps to create an ethical narrative. A protective ethic calls for protecting the patient’s identity and responding to predicaments in which the dignity of the person is threatened. In particular, nurses are sometimes asked to provide existential advocacy for their patients. Moreover, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where patient safety is a top priority, nurses must understand the existential threats facing patients and provide holistic care as existential advocates for patients and their families. However, it may be too much to require constant dedication and sacrifice from nurses. This article argues that it is important to establish an institutional support system for staffing, professional education, and self-care so that nurses can practice holistic care as professionals, rather than as “angels” or “heroes”. The ethics of care can contribute to self-growth and professional development toward a good life for both patients and nurses.",공병혜,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107859333

네덜란드에서의 안락사 담론 -의료적 안락사 판결 사례와 통계자료조사를 중심으로-,"This article describes the origins and rationale of the Dutch policy on euthanasia. Euthanasia is in principle illegal in the Netherlands, as it is in other countries. However, under certain conditions euthanasia is ""tolerated"" in the Netherlands. The Dutch ethicist Bert Gordijn attributes this to the typical Dutch mentality to avoid radical positions and instead compromise in disputes. According to Gordijn, two dominant and somewhat contrary social forces from the 17th century influenced the Dutch mentality and policy: conservative Calvinism and free trade. Disputes emerging from conflicting interests were traditionally resolved according to the policy of tolerance, and certain illegal acts remained unpunished. The Dutch policy concerning euthanasia, a typical example of pragmatic tolerance, attempts to prevent the greater evil of unregulated euthanasia by tolerating the lesser evil of euthanasia under strict preconditions. Ongoing public discussion in the Netherlands about the legitimacy of more liberal euthanasia laws have given rise to the current Dutch policy on euthanasia and medically assisted suicide",김문정 ( Moon Jeong Kim ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A87018132
중환자의 윤리적 쟁점들,"Critically ill patients are vulnerable patient that could not speak for their interests due to their life-threatening condition. Sometimes they should get an invasive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) to overcome their fatal and serious illness, which involve pain they do not want. Thus the ethical conflict is common in the ICU and in particular, ethical issues related to the “right to life” or “death” are difficult and complex. Major sources of conflicts are behavioral issues among stakeholders, such as verbal abuse or poor communication between physicians and nurses, and end-of-life care issues including a lack of respect for the patient’s autonomy. These conflicts may cause ICU workers’ physical and mental exhaustion, which often result in threats to patient safety. When healthcare professionals lack knowledge to recognize the ethical implications, ethical conflicts occur frequently. The physicians themselves need to be more sensitive to behavioral conflicts and enable shared decision making in end-of-life care. At the same time, the institutions and administrators should develop their processes to find and resolve common ethical problems in their ICUs.",문재영,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104542148
낙태죄 헌법불합치와 자기결정권: ‘비지배 자유’ 담론을 중심으로,"Abortion is both a personal issue and a social problem. It should be viewed from a holistic point of view, one that takes into account, not only the decisions women make to terminate or continue pregnancies, but also their decisions concerning childbirth and nurturing. The dichotomous “pro-choice versus pro-life” debate is incapable of resolving the complex social and ethical issues associated with abortion. Moreover, discussions of the right to life of an embryo/fetus typically assume a controversial hierarchy of rights as well as a questionable concept of normality. And confusion between the right to life and protection of life raises new challenges in the policy debates concerning abortion. Liberty as non-domination is not something that one can enjoy as an isolated atomic entity. Rather, it is only in its relation to fellow citizens and the state that one can experience such freedom. Liberty as non-domination also emphasizes the state's civic responsibility to accept, and appropriately respond to, constructive criticism. This article advances the view that the ideal of liberty as non-domination has implications for abortion.

The percentage of participants who reported sleep disorders was 35.3% for “no disclosure”, 28.1% for “partial disclosure”, and 31.3% for “full disclosure” (p=0.673). The results of the survey indicate that those who experience patient safety incidents do not in general receive proper responses from the relevant medical professionals.
