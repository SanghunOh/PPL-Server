임신성 당뇨병을 가진 임산부를 위한 간호중재 프로그램의 효과: 무작위 대조군 실험연구의 체계적 문헌고찰,"Purpose: This study aimed to identify the effects of nursing intervention programs for women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) through a critical review of recent studies.
Methods: Studies related to effects of nursing intervention programs for women with GDM published in English or Korean between 2000 and 2019 were extracted from 10 electronic databases. The quality of the studies was evaluated and double-checked for accuracy by two reviewers using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized controlled trials.
Results: Twenty studies were selected, of which 19 had a low risk of bias and one had a high risk of bias. Interventions fell into six main groups: (1) integrated interventions, (2) self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, (3) dietary interventions, (4) exercise, (5) psychotherapy, and (6) complementary therapy. This review found that nursing interventions for GDM were of many types, and integrated interventions were the most common. However, low-carbohydrate diets and blood glucose monitoring interventions did not show statistically significant results. Evidence shows that various nursing intervention programs applied to GDM improved diverse aspects of maternal, fetal, and neonatal health, including both physical and psychological aspects.
Conclusion: The composition and delivery of integrated interventions continue to evolve, and these interventions affect physical and psychological indicators. Although interventions affecting physical health indicators (e.g., blood glucose levels, diet, and exercise) are important, many studies have shown that programs including psycho-emotional nursing interventions related to anxiety, depression, stress, self- efficacy, and self-management are also highly useful.",김주희 ( Joohee Kim ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107355035

Methods In total, 136 primiparous women over 37 weeks of gestation receiving epidural analgesia during vaginal delivery were recruited via convenience sampling. To minimize diffusion effects, data from the control group (n=71) were collected first (April 2020 to March 2021), followed by data from the music group (n=65; April 2021 to May 2022). Participants in the music group listened to classical music during labor, while the control group was offered usual care (no music). Labor pain was measured using a numeric rating scale (NRS), and self-esteem and childbirth experience were collected using self-report questionnaires. Data were analyzed using the independent t-test, chi-square test and Cronbach’s α coefficients.
Results The overall pain level (NRS) at baseline was 0 in both groups. Mothers in the music therapy group had lower levels of latent pain (t=1.95, p=.005), active pain (t=3.69, p<.001) and transition-phase pain (t=7.07, p<.001) than the control group. A significant difference was observed between the two groups, and the music therapy group expressed more positive perceptions of the childbirth experience (t=-1.36, p=.018). For self-esteem, the experimental group’s score was slightly higher, but without a statistically significant difference from the control group.
Conclusion Using music therapy during labor decreased labor pain and improved the childbirth experience. Music therapy can be clinically recommended as a non-pharmacological, safe, and easy method for nursing care in labor.",안성연,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108637263

Methods: The data were searched from RISS, Pubmed, CHINAL, EMBASE with key words of ‘aged’, ‘korean’, ‘accidental falls’. The Joanna Briggs Institute was used to assess methodological quality. Data were extracted for sample nature, the type, element, material, delivery, and intensity of the intervention, measures, and findings. Results: A total of fifty nine studies were selected for this review. Most studies were conducted with only female older adults(66.1%) and small sample (less than 30 subjects) (93.2%). Exercise was the most frequently evaluated intervention type, with a small number of studies including education. Face-to-face(group) was the most frequently evaluated intervention delivery mode; only a small number of studies evaluated non face-to-face intervention. 12 weeks, 3 times a week, and 60 minutes per session were the most frequently evaluated intervention intensity. An exercise intervention was effective in balance and muscle strength. Fall prevention interventions face-to-face(group), delivered at least for 8 weeks, 3 times a week, and 40 minutes per day may be more effective. Conclusion: This review showed the current status of fall prevention intervention for the Korean older adults.

Participants had moderate levels of pregnancy stress (mean, 23.09±7.11 points out of 48) and maternal knowledge (mean, 14.42±4.67 points out of 21), whereas social support was somewhat high (mean 45.88±7.81 points out of 60). Pregnancy stress was weakly negatively correlated with social support (r=-.37, p<.001). Main source of pregnancy information (β=-.21, p=.011), marital satisfaction (β=-.18, p=.036), and social support (β=-.19, p=.038) were identified as significant factors affecting pregnancy stress, and these variables had an explanatory power of 22.7% for pregnancy stress.
Conclusion: Based on these findings, nurses should assess pregnancy-related stress during pregnancy and consider main source of pregnancy information and marital satisfaction when providing education or counseling. Moreover, strategies to reduce pregnancy stress through social support are needed to improve the quality of life for pregnant women.",강숙정 ( Sook Jung Kang ),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108101845
