In the legal regulation of euthanasia, the doctor's duty to keep life should be weighed against the patient's rights of self-determination or keeping human dignity. It is generally accepted that the doctor's duty takes precedence of the patient's rights in case of the positive euthanasia. As regards the indirect euthanasia, the doctor's duty and the patient's rights are valued equally. However, in the matter of the negative euthanasia, the patient's rights are more important than the doctor's duty.

Ⅱ. The structure of legitimating euthanasia
The extend of the doctor's duty to keep life in the cases is judged by the juduciary. But, in case of euthanasia, there can be no substantial standard giving priority to certain rights and the judge can not be the appropriate subject of decision.

Ⅲ. The procedural legitimation of euthanasia
To perform legal euthanasia, the doctor should
① record the case history of patient and verify his/her incurability and severe pain,
② be demanded euthanasia continuously by the patient who accept euthanasia of his/her own free will,
③ discuss with the patient's family or religionist,
④ discuss with other doctors about performing euthanasia,
⑤ keep records of the euthanasia process.
If these requisites are fulfilled, the right of final decision on euthanasia should be given to doctor. And the doctor has also the obligation of keeping the euthanasia procedure which is controlled by the criminal sanctions.",이상돈,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2059983

"건강신념모델을 적용한 AIDS예방의 건강신념, 태도 및 건강행동","This study was conducted in order to identify the extent to which Health Belief Model(HBM) constructs explain the likelihood of taking preventive behaviors for AIDS among the young adolescents in Korea. HBM was applied as the theoretical framework for developing questionnaire items in this study. The survey instrument included all of the constructs of Health Belief Model, namely, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, cue to actions for preventive behaviors concerning AIDS. Additionally, demographic characteristics of the respondents, their sexual experiences, and AIDS Knowledge Test were included in the study. Each of HBM constructs were developed with a 5-point Likert type scale from 1(never agree) to 5 (absolutely agree). The survey was conducted with a total of 247 military men in a city on September 18, 1996, using self-reported questionnaire.
The results of the study were summarized as follows:
1. Because the subjects for this study were military soldiers, their demographic characteristics were limited to all men, young age, and unmarried. Educational status was evenly distributed between high school graduates and university students.
2. On the average, the respondents started their first sexual relationship at 18 years old and 82.6% of them did not use condom when having their first sexual experience. Thirty one percent of the subjects had sexual contact with prostitutes and the average number of sexual contact with prostitutes was 5 times during the past 2 years.
3. The results of AIDS Knowledge Test scores demonstrated that the respondents had a high level of knowledge about AIDS. However, some misconceptions about transmission of AIDS through casual contact were still prevailed. Sixty-six percent of the respondents expressed that people infected with HIV should be isolated from the society in order to protect the general public.
4. All the respondents expressed that they had heard about AIDS before. TV was found to be the source which provided information on AIDS most frequently.
5. Among fundamental constructs of Health Belief Model, scores of perceived benefit of taking preventive action against AIDS marked the highest score, while scores of perceived susceptibility were the lowest. As a result of Multiple Stepwise Regression analysis, 13 variable groups were found to predict the preventive action by 25%. Among them, only perceived benefit variables was the most significant factor to explain preventive behaviors by 17%.",김명혜,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2034807

There was a statistical difference between the two groups in job characteristics and organizational communication, and nurses in the rehabilitation ward showed higher scores in job characteristics and organizational communication than nurses in the general ward. The job satisfaction of rehabilitation ward nurses had a positive correlation with job characteristics and organizational communication and a negative correlation with job stress. The job satisfaction of general ward nurses was found to have a positive correlation with organizational communication and a negative correlation with job stress. Job stress and organizational communication were factors affecting job satisfaction in nurses in rehabilitation and general wards, with explanatory power of 38.8% and 22.7%, respectively. In this study, the importance of job stress management and effective organizational communication was confirmed by showing that job stress and organizational communication are factors affecting the job satisfaction of rehabilitation and general ward nurses.",배인정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108548719
"같지만 다른 그들, 청년: 성별 자살생각과 자살시도 영향요인의 탐색 연구","The purpose of this study is to provide basic data for an effective suicide prevention policy among young people. This study is an exploratory research study conducted to examine the difference between suicidal ideation and suicide attempt according to factors such as socioeconomic characteristics, health characteristics, psychosocial factors, and family factors. A survey was conducted by stratifying 1,012 young people aged 20-39 across the country, and descriptive statistical analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed. The results show that 42.1% of the study subjects had suicidal ideation and 5.6% had attempted suicide. The factors affecting suicidal ideation and suicide attempts were different by gender. Men had a higher risk of suicidal ideation when they had lower levels of education, subjective health status, sleep quality, and family strength (economic stability and cooperation) and higher levels of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. The higher depressive symptoms increased suicidal ideation in women. The factors influencing suicide attempts in men were high income, high depressive symptoms, and low family strength (caring about the community). In the case of women, unemployment, high subjective economic status, high depressive symptoms, and high social trust were influencing factors. For effective suicide prevention policy among young people, it is necessary to subdivide and specify the policy according to the characteristics of those people. In particular, the factors that cause people to respond differently to suicidal ideation and attempt should be closely identified, and it is necessary to understand the distribution of factors influencing gender and the patterns that appear due to differences in sensitivity.",강지원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108548714
코로나19 사태가 청소년 비만에 미치는 영향에 대한 연구: 비수도권 및 성별에 따른 차이를 중심으로,"This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescent obesity in Korea. In particular, we focus on whether there is a heterogeneous effect of COVID-19 on weight status between students living in metropolitan areas and students living in non-metropolitan areas. Using data from the Korea Youth Risk Behavior Survey (KYRBS), we find that students living in non-metropolitan areas are more likely to be overweight or obese than students in the metropolitan area. This impact is particularly evident among female students. To understand the underlying mechanism behind these results, we examine how physical and eating activities differ among female students by metropolitan resident status. We find that female students living in non-metropolitan areas show a higher frequency of eating activities that could negatively affect their weight status. These results suggest that there has been a gap in the health status of adolescents between the metropolitan area and non-metropolitan areas after the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the policy implications of this paper should be aimed at mitigating the gap through dietary support policies for adolescents living in non-metropolitan areas.",김봉균,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108548717

원격의료를 활용한 가정형 호스피스 활성화 방안,"Purpose: This study proposed a home-based hospice model and activation plan using telemedicine as a way to solve insufficient bed problems and limitations of medical resources, reduce the economic burden of hospitalization, and improve the quality of life of patients.
Methods: In this study, domestic and foreign cases of home-based hospice and telemedicine were analyzed through the review of related statistical data and literature and expert advice, and a plan to activate home-based hospice using telemedicine was proposed through case studies in advanced.
Results: Hospice and palliative care should be activated as a prerequisite for the activation of home-type hospice; 1) Improving access to home-based hospice 2) Providing active pain and symptom control and establishing a home care service system 3) Establishing a hospice linkage system 4) Establishing a hospice cluster 5) Supporting professional care providers 6) Providing hospice in nursing homes. Improvement tasks for promoting home-based hospice using telemedicine, First, doctors are given separate qualifications for telemedicine, Second, the scope of patients subject to telemedicine is limited, Third, legal requirements or standards are eased to enable telemedicine on-site, Fourth, it is necessary to prepare regulations on where to be responsible, such as immunity measures in the event of a medical accident, in a situation where certain procedures cannot be observed and controlled. Telemedicine is now not the subject of debate, but a demand of the times that needs to be implemented. As the number of terminal patients who want hospice and palliative care is increasing, the quality of life of terminal patients and their families should be improved by expanding home-based hospice utilizing telemedicine. A telemedicine model for home-based hospice patients was presented by referring to the above and telemedicine cases using hospice information system in Taiwan.
Conclusion: Since most of the home-based hospice are provided to patients who need care through home visits by medical staff without requiring separate surgery or treatment, telemedicine can be a good way to improve the quality of patients' lives by reducing the time and cost for home visits.",조병모,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108620865

인구 고령화의 인구학적 요인 분석,"This study examines the contribution of demographic components such as fertility and mortality to population aging in South Korea from 1970 to 2070. To investigate the demographic sources of population aging, this study used three approaches: (1) stable population models, (2)population simulation models comparing actual outcomes with counterfactual population projections, and (3) the decomposition of the rate of change in mean population age into its demographic components. The results indicate that, across different methodologies, fertility decline was the main driver of population aging over the past 50 years. However, the effect of mortality change has increasingly bigger influence and is likely to have a major effect on the future development of population aging in South Korea. Given that mortality plays a major role in future population aging, institutional arrangements such as the extended retirement need to be put in place to adapt our life cycle to the changing circumstances.

가임기 여성의 자궁근종의 보존적 치료와 임신 예후,"Uterine myomas are the most common benign tumors in reproductive aged women. There have been concerns about fertility and obstetric complications in pregnant women with myomas. Currently, maternal age for pregnancy is increasing, and uterine-preserving therapeutic procedures of uterine fibroids such as myomectomy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), or uterine artery embolization (UAE) have increased. However, it is unclear whether those treatments can improve fertility and pregnancy outcomes.
Recent data suggest that pregnancies after uterus-preserving procedures are associated with obstetric complications such as cesarean section, placenta previa, preterm labor, premature birth, and low birth weight. The biggest obstetric concern in pregnancies after uterine-preserving procedures is uterine rupture during pregnancy, which can threaten the survival of fetuses. Moreover, uterine rupture after myomectomy is more likely to occur before labor onset. Most international guidelines suggest that myomectomy be considered for a woman with uterine myomas who has undergone several unsuccessful in vitro fertilization cycles despite appropriate ovarian response and good-quality embryos or for a woman with symptomatic myomas. In addition, HIFU or UAE treatments are relative contraindications in women with a future pregnancy plan, because there are limited data about associated pregnancy outcomes, and UAE can affect fertility after the procedure. The risks of uterine rupture and of obstetric complications in pregnancies after myomectomy should be discussed in affected women with a future pregnancy plan.",엄지수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108114341

"의료서비스 만족도, 보건의료체계 만족도와 신뢰","This study investigated the relationships between trust in the healthcare system, satisfaction with health services, and satisfaction with the healthcare system. It also aimed to analyze the mediating effects among them, contributing to healthcare policy and service improvement. A literature review established theoretical models and research hypotheses for the relationships among health service satisfaction, healthcare system satisfaction, and trust in the healthcare system. Empirical analyses were conducted using the original data from the 2020 Medical Service Experience Survey (MSES).
The research showed a positive relationship between inpatient and outpatient medical service satisfaction and trust in the healthcare system. Notably, satisfaction with the healthcare system demonstrated mediating effects between outpatient and inpatient service satisfaction and trust in the healthcare system. These findings imply that improving both individual medical service satisfaction and overall healthcare system satisfaction is crucial to enhancing trust in the healthcare system.
However, this study has limitations due to its cross-sectional data, which restricts the establishment of causal relationships. Therefore, further longitudinal research and additional studies are necessary to obtain more robust and conclusive results. Nevertheless, the results of this study provide a better understanding of the relationship between trust and satisfaction in the healthcare system, offering essential implications for healthcare policy and service enhancement.",이근찬,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108766350
고위험 음주와 흡연이 당뇨 환자의 치료와 합병증 관리에 미치는 영향: 단면연구,"PURPOSE:To investigate the effects of high-risk alcohol drinking and smoking status on the treatment and management of diabetes mellitus.
METHODS:The subjects were diabetic patients over 30 years of age who participated in the 2016 Community Health Survey. The primary outcome variable was untreated diabetes mellitus. The secondary outcome variables were screening for diabetic retinopathy, screening for diabetic nephropathy, and awareness of HbA1c. The main explanatory variables were high-risk alcohol drinking and smoking status. We tested the association between the explanatory variables and outcome variables using multivariable logistic regression analysis. We also evaluated the interaction between alcohol drinking and smoking status.
RESULTS:Total 23,763 participants were included, and region population-weighted 3,278,816 subjects were analyzed. High-risk drinkers had 1.39 times higher risk of untreated diabetes mellitus and also showed significantly higher risk in all the secondary outcomes. Smoking status did not have a significantly higher risk of untreated diabetes mellitus. However, in the screening for diabetic retinopathy, screening for diabetic nephropathy, and awareness of HbA1c, the current smokers showed 1.42, 1.21, and 1.70 times higher risk than nonsmokers, respectively. There were significant interactions between high-risk drinking and smoking in unreceived diabetic nephropathy screening and unawareness of HbA1c.
CONCLUSIONS:Both high-risk drinking and smoking increased the risk of untreated and unmanaged diabetes. We also observed the significant interaction between high-risk alcohol drinking and smoking. These findings can be used as evidence to support the importance of alcohol drinking and smoking cessation policies.",정승민,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106337800
"원격의료 정책현황 비교 분석 연구: 미국, 일본, 한국을 중심으로","In 2009, the government announced the first legislative amendment of the Medical Law, allowing physician-patient telemedicine, and then the legislation was announced again in the period of Park Geun-hye's government in 2013, but due to the vehement opposition of the health care organization, legislation was pending in the National Assembly. Recently, as the Moon Jae-in government started, the policy for telemedicine has become unacceptable. However, in the era of the fourth industrial revolution, information and communication technology will be developed more and the need and role of telemedicine is expected to grow in solving the problems of the medical delivery system. Despite the need to discuss and prepare specific standards and regulations for telemedicine in order to successfully achieve policy goals when telemedicine is introduced, there is a lack of preparation for this. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to derive the policy implications by systematically comparing and analyzing Korea's policy situation with the cases of the United States and Japan which are conducting telemedicine ahead of Korea in the future when the telemedicine is allowed. The results show that the United States and Japan are very detailed and rigorous about telemedicine related laws, jurisdictional agencies, financial support (insurance and medical fee), provision standards(object, region, type, provider qualification criteria and responsibilities). On the other hand, Korea has relatively ambiguous regulations about telemedicine. Therefore, based on the experience of remote medical practice in developed countries, it is necessary to discuss the preconditions and environment for the successful implementation of telemedicine in Korea and to provide institutional maintenance that contains specific regulations.",김진숙,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105258030

노인빈곤 원인에 대한 고찰: 노동시장 경험과 가족구조 변화를 중심으로,"This study analyzed whether the labor market experience and family structure change in people in their 50s are affecting poverty among the elderly. According to the results of the analysis, the poverty rate of the elderly was low at 9.6% in the case of full-time workers while participating in the main economic activities. For those who had been economically inactive for a long time, elderly poverty rate was almost four times higher. Elderly poverty was higher among women than among men, regardless of their primary economic activity, so gender was more influential than economic activity. In the main job change, it showed a low poverty rate when it was somewhat stable and possessed functions. By company size, it was analyzed that the smaller the company size, the more experienced poverty. Changes in the number of households were 22.7% when the number of households increased, 36.5% when the number of households remained unchanged, and 28.1% when the number of households decreased, affecting elderly poverty. As for the marital status, maintaining the marital status as a married woman in the fifties also affected the poverty rate of the elderly. In order to lower the old-age poverty rate in the future, as the experiences of people in their fifties affect elderly poverty, government support is needed in the labor market for the large burden of spending on the same wages and the difference in welfare by company size. In the case of family structure changes, institutional arrangements are needed to strengthen care, support emotions, and especially support women vulnerable to family structure changes.",이주미,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106926740

난임으로 인한 외래이용 및 외래진료비 지출 분석,"This study aimed to analyze the characteristics of women who used outpatient services for infertility and their healthcare expenditure. Using data from the 2012-2018 Korea Health Panel Study, we constructed an unbalanced panel data of women aged 20-49 with a history of using outpatient services due to the diagnosis of female infertility (N97). Among the 13,124 observations (2,951 persons), 98 observations (59 persons, 0.7%) were diagnosed with infertility, and they were 34.7 years old on average. All were enrolled in the National Health Insurance, with a college degree or higher (83.7%), in high-income households of the 5th quintile (55.1%), and working in a regular or permanent position (36.7%). The average user fees, including covered and uncovered payments, were 1.44 million KRW per a woman and 1.45 million KRW per a couple. It accounts for about 2.3% of the total household income. Based on Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Use, the predisposing factors, when women were over 35 years of age and had no children, the number of outpatient visits, user fees and its household burden were higher than those under the age of 35 and those with children. Among the enabling factors, there were differences in women's job security, husband’s education level, and household income. There was no significant difference in the outpatient visits for infertility according to the need factors, such as chronic disease and obesity status of women. This study showed that outpatient use for infertility care is concentrated on a higher socio-economic status group, and called for policy attention for women in low-income groups who may experience unmet healthcare needs for infertility treatments.",문주현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108285212

폐 절제술 후 걷기 운동을 경험한 폐암 환자의 수술 후 회복 관련 요인,"Background: Treatment for lung cancer, which has high incidence and mortality rates, involves lung resection; however, the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications is high. Early walking exercise is a core strategy for preventing complications and promoting postoperative recovery, which is essential for returning to everyday life. This study aims to identify the factors associated with the postoperative recovery of patients who performed walking exercises in an intensive care unit after having a lung resection.
Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data from 90 patients on the day before discharge at a tertiary hospital in Seoul between April and June 2019. Patients’ postoperative recovery was measured using the Postoperative Recovery Profile.
Results: The mean score for postoperative recovery was 0.70±0.41 out of 3, 0 being none of the problems.
Among the five subcategories, the psychological dimension had the highest recovery level at 0.57±0.58, while physical symptoms were rated lowest at 0.89±0.50. As a result of regression analysis, employment status (β=4.353, P=0.005), symptoms of nausea and vomiting during walking (β=0.596, P=0.043), and perceived exertion during walking (β=1.105, P=0.007) were associated with postoperative recovery.
Conclusions: The study indicated unemployed patients, those with more nausea and vomiting, and those who perceived severe exertion during walking showed lower perceived postoperative recovery levels. Not only multidisciplinary, patient-tailored interventions to facilitate return to work after surgery but also interventions to control physical symptoms actively should be developed and implemented to achieve higher postoperative recovery levels.

중고령자 1인가구 삶의 만족도 변화 및 영향 요인 분석: 중고령자 다인가구와 비교 분석,"The purpose of this study was to suggest a policy direction for middle-aged and elderly single-person households by comparing and analyzing changes in life satisfaction and factors influencing them with those of multi-person households. For the study, data from the Korea Welfare Panel (12th~15th waves) were used, and 1,378 single-person households and 6,382 multi-person households were analyzed for middle-aged and elderly adults over 40 years of age. By using a latent growth model, we analyzed the factors affecting the change in life satisfaction, the intercept, and slope of single-person households and multi-person households of middle-aged and elderly people.
The main conclusions drawn from the study are as follows. First, the life satisfaction of middle-aged and elderly people tended to decrease regardless of single-person and multi-person households, but the level of life satisfaction of single-person households was relatively low. Second, income and self-esteem were common variables that had a significant effect on life satisfaction of middle-aged and elderly people, and in particular, self-esteem had an effect on the intercept and slope of life satisfaction. Third, middle-aged people showed a lower level of life satisfaction than the elderly, and in particular, it was confirmed that middle-aged single-person households had a greater negative effect on life satisfaction than multi-person households. Fourth, education level, participation of volunteer and labor activity were significant variables to increase life satisfaction for middle-aged and elderly people in multi-person households, but no significant effect could be confirmed for single-person households.
The implications drawn from the findings are as follows. First, increased support is needed to improve the quality of life of single-person households of middle-aged and elderly people. Second, support is needed in connection with self-esteem and psychological recovery of single-person households of middle-aged and elderly people.",홍성표,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108193772

The main results are as follows. There were significant differences in the sleep quality according to gender, cancer recurrence, diagnosis, and duration of cancer. There were significant correlations between pain, depression, fear of cancer recurrence, and sleep quality. As a result of hierarchical multiple regression, fear of cancer recurrence, gender, recurrence, and duration of cancer were found to be significant influencing factors. Therefore, psychosocial intervention such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness should be provided. In addition, there is a need for a policy to expand manpower to provide psychosocial intervention and to establish a psycho-oncology department in a cancer center.",박인희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108294966

"국내 일차의료 및 공공보건의료 발전방향: 미국, 호주, 독일 그리고 쿠바 사례와의 비교","The objective of this study is to identify problems and solutions on Korean public health care and primary health care system by comparing with other countries. Specifically, the systems of the Unit- ed States, Australia, Germany and Cuba were compared and we tried to suggest a direction of im- provement in the Korean system. A literature review on primary care and public care were employed to perform an extensive comparison of systems. The main results of this study are as follows. First, a gate keeper such as primary care physician is lacking in Korea and thus, it results in problems such as discontinuity in medical care and rising medical costs. Second, the reimbursement on primary care is not sufficient in Korea, which may result in poor quality of medical care and excessive supply of medical services. Third, a framented delivery system in Korea which generates inefficiency in healthcare system. Especially, the legal classification and functions of primary, secondary and tertia- ry institutions were not clearly designed so that a significant proportion of patients seek for primary care in tertiary hospitals in Korea. To improve the overall health of the population and to reduce health inequality, this study suggests 1) to introduce a gate keeper system, 2) to reform the payment system, and 3) to design an integrated healthcare system which can reduce inefficiencies.",윤보영,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107153005
청소년의 수면시간과 정신건강과의 관련성,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sleep duration and mental
health for adolescents. The subjects consisted of 54,766 middle and high school students. Using
statistics from 13th (2017) Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, complex samples
logistic regression was conducted. Stress, depression, and suicidal ideation were significantly
different from sleep duration, respectively. Stress, depression, and suicidal ideation were more
prevalent among adolescents who had <5hr per day of sleep duration. After controlling general
characteristics, sleep duration was significantly related to stress, depression, and suicidal ideation.
Short sleep duration was shown to be a risk factor for poor mental health in adolescents.
Therefore, mental health care professionals should consider including adolescents with short sleep
duration before providing intervention.",윤현정,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105549838

도시 노인의 걷기실천과 건강증진에 관한 근거이론 연구,"Objectives: This study aimed to conceptualize the walking experience of urban older adults from the perspective of health promotion. Methods: The research design applied a grounded theory approach. Theoretical sampling was implemented until theoretical saturation was reached, and 33 older adults living in a pedestrian-friendly community in Seoul were recruited for the study. Data were collected only at the first stage of social distancing between July and December 2020. This study employed qualitative multi-methods that combined in-depth interviews and field observation. The collected data were analyzed through open, axial, and selective coding, while text and spatial information were integrated during axial coding. Results: The open coding resulted in 83 concepts, 35 subcategories, and 14 categories, which were reconstructed according to the coding paradigm structure for axial coding. The walking experience phenomenon among urban older adults was reflected through the following: “subjectivity as a healthy older adult,” “autonomy of movement,” and “diverse range of daily experiences in terms of walking.” This phenomenon was linked to multidimensional health promotion by facilitating interactions between older adults and the environment in the context of urban old adults. Conclusion: A healthy and age-friendly community should move toward promoting the interaction between older adults and the environment by increasing the frequency of walking for various purposes.",김동하,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108081559
