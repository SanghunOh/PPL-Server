중환자의 욕창 예방 연구,"Background : A pressure sore was defined as any skin lesion caused by unrelieved pressure and resulting in damage to underlying tissue. The health care institutions in the United States were reported the incident rate of pressure sores ranging from 6 to 14%. United states were reported the incident rate of pressure sores in patients rate of pressure sore. Also, Annual expenditures for the care of pressure sores in patients in the United States have been estimated to be $7.5 billion; furthermore, 50 percent more nursing time is required to care for patients with pressure sore in comparison to the time needed to implement preventive measures against pressure sore formation. However, In Korea, there were little reliable reports, or researches, about incidence rates of pressure sore in health care institution including intensive care unit and about the integrated approach like CQI action team for risk assessment, prevention and treatment of pressure ulders. Therefore, this study was to develop pressure sore risk assessment tool and the protocol for prevention of pressure sore formation through CQI action team activities, to monitor incident rate of pressure sore and the length of sore formation for patients at high risk, and to approximately estimate nursing time for sore dressing during research period as the effect of CQI action team.
Method : CQI action team in intensive care unit, launched since early 1996, reviewed the literature for the standardized risk assessment tool, developed the pressure sore assessment tool based on the Braden Scale, tested its validity, compared on statistics including incidence rate of pressure sore for patients at high risk. Throughout these activities, CQI action team was developed the protocol.called as St. Marys hospital Intensive Care Unit Pressure Sore Protocol, shifted the emphasis from wound treatment to wound prevention, After applied the protocol to patients at high risk, the incident rate and the period of prevention against pressure development were tested with those for patients who received care before implementation of protocol by Chi-square and Kaplan-Meier Method of Survival Analysis.
Result : The CQI action team found that there was significant difference of incidence rate of pressure sores between patients at high risk( control group) who received care implementation of protocol (p<.05). 25% possibility of pressure sore formation was shown for the patients with 6th hospital day in ICU in control group. In experimental group, the patients with 10th hospital day had 10% possibility of pressure sore. Therefore, there was significant difference(p< .05) in survival rate between two groups. Also, nursing time for dressing on pressure sore in experimental group was deceased as much as 50% of it in control group.
Conclusion : The collaborative team effort led to reduced incidence, increased the length of prevention against pressure sore, and declined nursing care times for sore dressing. However, there have had several suggestions for future study. The preventive care system for pressure sore should be appleed to patients at moderate, or low risk throughout continuous CQI team activities based on Bed sore Indicator Fact Sheet. Hospital-wide supports, such as incentives, would be offered to participants for keeping strong commitment to CQI team. Also, Quality Information System monitoring incidents and estimation cost of poor quality. like workload(full time equivalence) or financial loss, regularly in a hospital has to be developed first for supporting CQI team activities as well as empowering hospital-wide QI implementation. Being several limitations, this study would be one of the report cards for the CQI team activities in intensive care unit of an acute hospital and a trial of quality improvement of health care in Korea.",강소영,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40028581

입원환자 낙상 발생 실태와 원인에 관한 분석 연구,"Background : The purpose of this research was to examine the fall incidence rate and its related factors of fall in inpatients.
Methods : The data were collected from the 138 fall incident reports in one tertiary hospital in Seoul from April 1st 1999 to September 30th 2001. The Fall Incident Report Form was originally developed based on that of Massachusetts General Hospital revised in 1995. And this was modified for this survey by the collaborating work of QI team including researcher and department of nursing service of this particular hospital. The contents of Fall Incident Form were general characteristics of patient, factors related to fall, types and places of fall, circumstances, nursing interventions, and outcome.
Results : 1)the incidence rate of fall was 0.08% of total discharged patients and 0.081 per 1000 patient-day. This incidence rate is much lower than that of general hospitals in USA. This finding might result from the different incidence report system of each hospital. 2)The characteristics of fall-prone patient were found as follows. They were mostly over 60 years old, in alert mental status, ambulatory with some assistance, and dependent on ambulatory device. The types of diseases related high incidence rate were cerebrovascular disease(3.2), hypertension(1.6), cardiovascular disease(1.4), diabetes(1.3) and liver disease(0.6). 3)The majority of fall events usually occurred in bed, beside(walking or standing)and bathroom in patient room. Usually they were up on their own when they fell. And there were more falls of elderly occurred during night time than day or evening. 4)63.8% of fall events resulted in physical injuries such as fracture and usually the patients had diagnostic procedures and some treatment(ex.suture)which caused additional cost to the patients and their families. 5)The found risk factors of fall were drugs(antihypertensive drug, diuretics)and environmental factors like too high bed height, long distance of bedside table and lamp switch, and slippery tile of bathroom floor.
Conclusion : Considering these results, every medical and nursing staff should be aware of the risk factors of patients in hospital, and should intervene more actively the preventive managements, specially for the elderly patients during night. Therefore, it is recommended that the development of Fall Prevention Programs based on these results.",김철규,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40027799

중환자 재활에서 물리치료사의 역할과 필요성,"In the past, patients in the intensive care unit were mostly managed by the intensive care unit's own protocol through bed rest and sedation.
The number of hospitalized patients in intensive care units in Korea is steadily increasing, but the mortality rate is higher than in developed countries and the perception of intensive care rehabilitation is lowered.
The reality of intensive care rehabilitation in korea has many problems due to low fee structure, lack of manpower, and lack of policy establishment and will of related institutions. In addition, intensive carerehabilitation should consist of a multidisciplinary tema, and the team composition should include professionals such as dedicated doctors, dedicated nurses, and physical therapists. Although the effect of intensive care unit rehabilitation has been confirmed through previous foreign studies, the reality of intensive care unit rehabilitation in Korea is currently lagging behind due to a system of low medical fees and the will of government agencies.

또래애착이 아동의 주관적 행복감에 미치는 영향 : 자아존중감의 매개효과,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the mediating effect of children's perceived peer attachment on children's subjective well-being and the effects of self-esteem, one of the variables of individual personality characteristics, on peer attachment and subjective well-being.
Design: Data from the 2018 Panel Study on Korean Children were used.
Methods: The survey method was conducted by the investigator, and the total number of cases was 1,434 people.
Results: First, the higher the child's peer attachment leads to higher subjective well-being and self-esteem, and the higher the self-esteem leads to higher subjective well-being. Second, in the relationship between peer attachment and subjective well-being, self-esteem acts as a mediator variable. Third, children's peer attachment affects subjective well-being and self-esteem, and self-esteem affects subjective well-being. The results explain that the degree of children's peer attachment itself affects subjective well-being and self-esteem, and self-esteem also affects children's subjective well-being.
Conclusion: Self-esteem is an important factor influencing subjective well-being and has a mediating effect on the relationship between peer attachment and subjective well-being. In other words, it can be understood that children feel subjective well-being through positive interactions with peers, not only in parent relationships. Based on these results, it is necessary to suggest practical interventions to enhance children's subjective sense of well-being and to develop various programs that can strengthen the sub-factors of peer attachment.",김상우,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108295437

Ten healthy students (6 male, 4 female) were recruited and three times randomly selected trials of isometric contraction of wrist flexion and extension were evaluated using four technique. These methods were compared which varied in terms of EMG processing, threshold value and the number of samples for which the mean must exceed the defined threshold, and beyond 7% of maximum amplitude. To identify determination of onset time, ICCs(Intraclass Correlation Coefficients) was used and inter-rater and intra-rater reliability ranged good in visually derived onset values. The results of this study present that in wrist flexion and extension, the reliability of the inter and intra-examiner muscle contraction onset times through visual analysis showed beyond .971 with ICCs. The reliability of the muscle contraction onset time decision through visual reading, tested with computer analysis, showed a relationship of all the selected analysis methods with ICCs .859 and .871. The objective computer-based analysis comparing with visual reading at the same time is the effective and qualitative data analysis method, considering the specificity of each study method.",정이정,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30004188
중증 COVID-19 환자에서 호흡재활프로그램의 종합적 효과: 단일사례연구,"Purpose: This study was designed to determine the comprehensive effects of a respiratory rehabilitation program on the immune system, pulmonary function, motor ability, and activities of daily living (ADLs) in a patient with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: A 73-year-old female patient diagnosed with severe COVID-19 was recruited at OO university hospital. The respiratory rehabilitation program was conducted for 8 weeks, 5 days per week, for 120 min per day, and consisted of aerobic and strength exercises. We assessed the changes in the immune system-related cells and inflammatory markers, dyspnea, coughing ability, respiratory muscle strength, pulmonary functions, upper and lower extremity strength, balance, walking speed, and ADLs. Results: The lymphocytes showed a meaningful increase after the intervention, whereas the level of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased, suggesting the setting down of inflammation. COVID-19-related dyspnea was reduced, and the coughing ability of the patient was improved. Finally, there were remarkable increases in the upper and lower extremity strength, balance, walking speed, and ADL assessments. Conclusion: Hence, we suggest that the respiratory rehabilitation program, which includes aerobic and strength exercises, helps patients with COVID-19 relieve the main symptoms, such as dyspnea and cough, and improve the immune system and pulmonary function, motor ability, and ADLs.",이태헌,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108405419
