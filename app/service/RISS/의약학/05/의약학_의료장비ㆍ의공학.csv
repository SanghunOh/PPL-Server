CRISPR/Cas 진단의 원리와 현황,"The POCT (point-of-care test) sensing that has been a fast-developing field is expected to be a next generation technology in health care. The POCT sensors for the detection of proteins, small molecules and especially nucleic acids have lately attracted considerable attention. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the POCT methods are required to follow the ASSURED guidelines (Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User- friendly, Robust and rapid, Equipment-free, Deliverable to all people who need the test). Recently, several CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) based diagnostic techniques using the sensitive gene recognition function of CRISPR have been reported. CRISPR/Cas (Cas, CRISPR associated protein) systems based detection technology is the most innovative gene analysis technology that is following the ASSURED guidelines. It is being re-emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool that can detect nucleic acids due to its characteristics that enable rapid, sensitive and specific analyses of nucleic acid. The first CRISPR-based diagnosis begins with the discovery of the additional function of Cas13a. The enzymatic cleavage occurs when the conjugate of Cas protein and CRISPR RNA (crRNA) detect a specific complementary sequence of the target sequence. Enzymatic cleavage occurs on not only the target sequence, but also all surrounding non-target single-stranded RNAs. This discovery was immediately utilized as a biosensor, and numerous sensor studies using CRISPR have been reported since then. In this review, the concept of CRISPR, the characteristics of the Cas protein required for CRISPR diagnosis, the current research trends of CRISPR diagnostic technology, and some aspects to be improved in the future are covered.",박지웅,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107811566

"우리나라 공공의료 강화를 위해 공공의대는 꼭 필요한가?: 누가, 왜 공공의대를 만들려 하는가?","The purpose of this study is to clarify the background of the controversial attempt to establish a new public medical school linked to compulsory service as a means of strengthening public healthcare in Korea, and to raise anticipated problems with possible solutions. In Korea, healthcare is predominantly provided by the private sector focused on medical care, rather than public healthcare, even under the national health insurance system. The government has been mainly in charge of public health and unmet medical services from a residual perspective, but health inequalities still exist. To resolve this issue, the government created the concept of public health and medical service (PHMS) from a universal perspective and tried to strengthen the infrastructure of public healthcare and to foster core PHMS doctors by establishing a new public medical school linked to compulsory service in medically vulnerable areas. This study investigated the reality and concept of the new public medical school planned by the government, and identified problems such as the possibility of obtaining accreditation and evaluation before its establishment, the side effects of dividing doctors’ roles, the waste of huge amounts of resources, and insensitive policies. In conclusion, in order to resolve health inequalities in Korea, we need to train doctors through medical school education that strengthens the social responsibility of doctors along with strengthening public healthcare infrastructure, and to provide a better environment for doctors working in medically vulnerable areas through sophisticated policies.",한희철,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108043450

간호교육에서의 전문직 간 교육에 대한 현황과 발전방향,"This study examined the perception and readiness of nursing educators regarding interprofessional education (IPE), and discussed the validity and application of IPE in nursing. From December 2016 to January 2017, 239 nursing professors and nurses completed a structured questionnaire consisting of general characteristics, the Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale, the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Survey (RIPLS), and an IPE action plan. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and t-test using the IBM SPSS ver. 23.0 program (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The analysis revealed that 91.6% of the participants had not experienced IPE, and only 11.7% knew about IPE. However, approximately 80.0% answered that IPE is necessary. The results of this study showed that the score of the perceived need for cooperation was higher in nurses than it was in professors, while the score on competency and autonomy was higher in professors than it was in nurses. With reference to the scores on the RIPLS, those of professors were high on the sub-scales of teamwork and collaboration, professional identity, and roles and responsibility. The results revealed that participants considered the upper-grade undergraduate years as the ideal time for imparting IPE, and it was deemed suitable to include communication, simulation, and clinical practice in IPE. Doctors, pharmacists, and physiotherapists were thought to require cooperation for IPE the most. Despite the presence of several barriers to IPE, the participants thought that IPE can achieve learning outcomes such as interprofessional communication and cooperation, conflict resolution, and teamwork. It is necessary to cooperate with professionals in the complex clinical environment as professional areas are specialized and subdivided. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the application of IPE in undergraduate education and in on-the-job training.",김건희,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103099098

한국 내 공공보건의료 개념의 문제점과 재설정,"The concept of “public health care (public health and medical services)” as discussed in South Korea is used in an unclear sense, with a meaning unlike the terminology used worldwide. The terms “public health care (public health and medical services)” and “health care (health and medical services)” have the same legal definition in Korea. Globally, “public health care (public health and medical services)” refers to medical services provided to the public that are operated as publicly funded resources, but in Korea, this term is confined to limited medical services prescribed by the government. The following considerations regarding “public health care (public health and medical services)” in Korea are proposed: All medical services performed by the state, regional governments, health care institutions, or health care workers to protect and promote the health of the people should be clearly established as “public health care (public health and medical services)” by definition. The financial burden borne by the state through national health insurance should be increased to an appropriate level to clarify the state's responsibility. Improving public health is an urgent priority in Korea, and this goal can be achieved by improving regional public health through systematic relationships between the state and regional governments, establishing a Ministry of Health, and efficiently allocating public health doctors who are important for providing regional medical care in rural and remote areas.

시변 가변차단주파수 저역통과필터를 이용한 심전도 고주파 잡음의 제거,"ECG signals are often contaminated with high-frequency noise such as muscle artifact, power line interference, and others. In the ECG signal processing, especially during a pre-processing stage, numerous noise removal techniques have been used to reduce these high-frequency noise without much distorting the original signal. This paper proposes a new type of digital filter with a continuously variable cutoff frequency to improve the signal quality This filter consists of a cutoff frequency controller (CFC) and variable cutoff frequency lowpass filter (VCF-LPF). From the noisy input ECG signal, CFC produces a cutoff frequency control signal using the signal slew rate. We implemented VCF-LPF based on two new filter design methods called convex combination filter (CCF) and weight interpolation fille. (WIF). These two methods allow us to change the cutoff frequency of a lowpass filter In an arbitrary fine step. VCF-LPF shows an excellent noise reduction capability for the entire time segment of ECG excluding the rising and falling edge of a very sharp QRS complex. We found VCF-LPF very useful and practical for better signal visualization and probably for better ECG interpretation. We expect this new digital filter will find its applications especially in a home health management system where the measured ECG signals are easily contaminated with high-frequency noises .",최안식,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101120319

히알루론산 마이크로니들 형태에 따른 특성 분석,"Conventional drug delivery methods mainly include subcutaneous injection and oral administration. Subcutaneous injection has the advantages of delivering the correct concentration, but it might cause pain and trauma to patients. Although oral administrations do not accompany pain as the subcutaneous injection, unexpected side effects may occur because they undergo digestion process and it is not easy for many drugs to be exposed to targeted sites with proper concentration. While dissolving microneedles have been extensively studied to overcome the limitations of conventional subcutaneous injection, the effects on microneedle shapes for drug release have not been fully explored. In this study, the characteristics of hyaluronic acid microneedles for cone and quadrangular pyramidal shapes were examined by the size, volume, contact surface area, skin permeability, and dissolution rate. As a result, the cone shapes of hyaluronic acid microneedles had high skin permeability, and the quadrangular pyramid of shapes hyaluronic acid microneedles showed a fast dissolution rate, given by the large contact area on the skin.

췌장암 조기진단을 위한 조건부 확률 기반 지능형 진단 방식,"Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer had been considered one of the important barrier for successful therapy since the five year survival rate after treatment of pancreatic cancer was critically low. Nonetheless, patients often miss the golden time of treatment because they rarely visit the hospital until their symptoms are severe. To overcome these problems, a lot of information about the patient's symptoms should be applied as biomarkers for early diagnosis. For this reason, a biomarker for early detection of pancreatic cancer (CA19-9) has been developed as a diagnostic kit. However, since the diagnosis is not accurate enough, pancreatic symptoms (abdominal pain, jaundice, anorexia, diabetes, etc.) and biomarkers (CA19-9) should be considered together. We develop an intelligent diagnostic system that considers CA19-9 and the incidence of pancreatic cancer for pancreatic symptoms that was determined by studying a large number of patient information. It shows a higher accuracy than one using CA19-9 alone.

신규간호사 교육체계에 대한 실태조사: 프리셉터십 운영을 중심으로,"The purpose of this study was to identify the current status of the new graduate nurses' education system, to establish guidelines for the education of new graduate nurses, and to provide dates for the improvement of the education system. Eighty-nine hospitals participated in the survey from July to August 2018. The questionnaires consisted of 24 items including general characteristics, new graduate nurses' education system, operation of nursing education teams, and preceptorship programs. The average duration of education/training for new graduate nurses was 57.3 days, and 26.6%-58.5% of general hospitals, hospitals, and long-term care hospitals had less than 30 days of new graduate nurses education/training, which is shorter than the education/training period of tertiary hospitals. There were new nursing education guidelines in 88.8% of all medical institutions and 58.6% of them had nursing education teams. Most of the personnel in charge of nursing education were not dedicated to education. A total of 87.6% of the all participating medical institutions had preceptorship programs, while 23.1%-33.3% of hospitals and long-term care hospitals did not. The breakdown of preceptorship programs showed 68.4% as ""preceptor and preceptee are in charge of one team, and preceptor is teaching preceptee,"" and 19.7% were ""preceptor and preceptee are in charge of each team, and preceptor is teaching preceptee at the same time."" These results show that standardization and management of new graduate nurses' education programs is necessary. For the standardization and management of new graduate nurses' education programs, joint efforts of nurses' associations and support from the government should be encouraged.",신수진,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106281342
