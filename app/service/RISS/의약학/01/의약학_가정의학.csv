대학생의 지각된 스트레스가 음주문제에 미치는 영향: 도피이론(Escape Theory)을 중심으로,"Background: This study examined how the perceived stress of college students leads to drinking problems based on the Escape Theory.
Methods: A total of 485 college students were surveyed. A moderated mediation analysis was used to test the hypotheses.
Results: Since no significant correlation was found between perceived stress and drinking problem, the dependent variable was replaced with problematic drinking, a sub-factor of drinking problem. Escape from self fully mediated the relationship between perceived stress and problematic drinking. The interaction of perceived stress and dysfunctional self-focus was correlated with escape from self. Coping motives to drinking strengthened the pathways from escape from self to problematic drinking.

파킨슨병증과 파킨슨병,"There are no biological markers for the antemortem diagnosis of degenerative parkinsonian disorders, diagnosis currently relies upon the presence and progression of clinical features and confirmation depends on neuropathology. Clinicopathologic studies have shown significant false-positive and false-negative rates for diagnosing these disorders, and misdiagnosis is especially common during the early stages of these diseases. The diagnosis of the atypical parkinsonian disorders is relevant in clinical practice since prognosis and treatment of patients with these disorders differs from those with Parkinson's disease.",박건우,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105807729

부정정서에 대한 지시된 회피가 경계성 성격장애 경향자의 충동적 행위에 미치는 영향,"Background: This study aims to examine the emotion regulation effect of directed avoidance on the impulsive behavior of individuals with traits of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Methods: A total of 44 participants with BPD traits were randomly assigned to the control group (n=22) and treatment group (n=22). Participants in the treatment group were directed to use avoidance when they experienced a negative emotion. Positive and negative emotions and impulsivity were measured before and after the negative emotion was induced; impulsivity was measured using the Stroop test and Contingency Delay task. Results: The Stroop test’s results demonstrated that there was a significant interaction effect of time and error between the groups, specifically, impulsivity increased in the control group when negative emotions were induced. However, the results of Contingency Delay task were marginally significant. The main effect of directed avoidance on discount rate k slightly increased but did not reach a significant level, and the interaction effect between the groups and time was not found. In the control group, discount rate k significantly increased after directed avoidance was induced; however, it was not significant in the treatment group. Conclusions: Findings from our study supported the effect of directed avoidance could be used as an emotional regulation method among individuals with traits of BPD, such as controlling impulsive behaviors.

노인 다제약물 관리 프로그램의 현황과 과제,"Polypharmacy is a major public health concern globally with aging populations and the increase in the prevalence of multimorbidity. This review provides an overview of polypharmacy and its management programs in older patients and describes the development direction and challenges of polypharmacy management strategies while considering the current situation in Korea. Although polypharmacy is often regarded as the routine use of at least five medications, the definition is more useful in terms of clinical appropriateness rather than the number of medications administered. The goal of polypharmacy management should be to ensure rational prescription based on clinical evidence and appropriate medication use in consideration of the patient’s individual factors. In order for doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to collaborate within a multidisciplinary team to ensure a comprehensive medication review, it would be effective to implement a management model in the form of a systematic program within the healthcare delivery system. Some countries are introducing sustainable polypharmacy management programs and developing standardized polypharmacy guidelines. It is required to conduct further benchmark studies of polypharmacy management programs in other countries that have proven their effectiveness while considering the Korean situation.",신우영(Woo-young Shin),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101491544
틱 장애의 진단과 치료,"Tics are brief, rapid and repetitive movement and sounds that are either simple or complex in presentation. Tics can be preceded by a premonitory urge (sensation) that decreases after tic is completed. The fourth edition of Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM- IV) includes diagnoses for Tourettes disorder, chronic motor or vocal tic disorder, transient tic disorder and tic disorder not otherwise specified (Table 1) according to the duration of tic symptoms and degree of complexity. The purposes of treatment of tic disorders must be set up based on the comprehensive evaluation of developmental profiles, strength, weakness, family situation, and school adaptation status. The family education must be included early in treatment process and psychosocial treatment including the cognitive behavioral therapy will be needed to develop and maintain the self-efficacy in controlling the tic symptoms. The most effective and efficient method for the reduction of tic symptoms, however, are drug treatment. The pharmacotherapy is usually one component of treatment for chronic tic disorder and Tourettes disorder. The gold standard　for tic reduction is the dopaminergic receptor blocking agent (or antipsychotic agent, neuroleptics). The primary drugs are haloperidol, pimozide, and risperidone. Among theses, risperidone will be the primary choice because of its low side effect profiles, esp, neurologic side effects. In the near future, the studies on the efficacy of the olanzapine, quetiapine and ziprasidone will be more reported. As second line drugs, clionidine, guanfacine, nicotine related drugs can be considered.",김붕년,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108535931
