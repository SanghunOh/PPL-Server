We revised KMAP-MDD andreestablished Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Depressive Disorder (KMAP-DD) in 2006.
Methods : A questionnaire had been developed by the executive committee for KMAP-DD. The review committee consisted of 101 experienced psychiatrists. From the total of 22 questions in the questionnaire, 7 questions were evaluated for these subjects . We classified the expert opinions to 3 categories according to its confidence interval; first, second and third line.
Results : SSRI and venlafaxine were the first line antidepressants (AD) for atypical and melancholic depression. For dysthymic disorder and minor depressive disorder, SSRI was recommended as the first line medications. Only AD medications was a preferred initial strategy for treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder, mild to moderate and severe non-psychotic postpartum depression. In severe psychotic postpartum depression, combination therapy of AD and atypical antipsychotics was the treatment of choice. SSRI was preferred when considering sedation, anticholinergic and cardiovascular adverse effects. Also, experts recommended mirtazapine against gastrointestinal adverse effects and bupropion in avoiding sexual dysfunction.
Conclusion : These results suggest that clinicians have to consider both clinical situations and drug adverse effects in the choice of antidepressant medications.",전현태,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2011097
"밤번고정근무 간호사와 3교대근무 간호사의 직무만족도, 간호업무수행정도 비교 및 밤번고정근무제도에 대한 인식","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare job satisfaction and nursing performance of nurses on fixed night shifts (FNS) and nurses working three shifts (W3S), to identify the environment of night work and recognition of the viability of the FNS system. Methods: The research was conducted with 106 nurses on FNS and 257 on W3S. The nurses had worked for 1 to 11 years at A hospital, Seoul. Results: Job satisfaction was significantly higher (t=-3.51, p< .001) for nurses on FNS. However, no significant difference was found for nursing performance (t=-1.019, p =.309) between the two groups. Both groups of nurses were mostly satisfied. Subjective fatigue scores (0 to 10 points) during the night for nurses on FNS (6.02) were lower than for W3S nurses (7.28) A high percentage (88.7%) of nurses on FNS indicated a willingness to further participate in FNS. Conclusion: Results indicate that the demonstration FNS system showed its effectiveness. Therefore, efforts are needed to enhance and revitalize FNS and to upgrade the system to control patient transfer time from emergency departments to wards, and to provide nurses needed resources for emergency or intensive care.",이은숙,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3002146

한국어판 강점ㆍ난점 설문지(Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) 개발,"Objectives : This study aims to develop a Korean version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Kr).
Methods : The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire that can be completed by the parents within 5 minutes and used to assess the psychopathology (prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity, emotional problems, conduct problems, and peer problems) of 4-16 year olds. The SDQ was translated into Korean, retranslated back to English, and corrected after discussion with the original developer and trial test. The reliability and validity of the SDQ-Kr was evaluated by working with 347 parents of nonclinical (n=98), pediatric outpatient (n=92), and psychiatric outpatient (n=157) children.
Results : Working with 62 parents of nonclinical children, the test-retest reliability of 5 subscales of SDQ-Kr was 0.94-0.84(p<0.01). For 190 nonclinical and pediatric children, internal consistency of 5 subscales of SDQ-Kr was 0.80-0.50 (Cronbach's α). Factor analysis generated the five identical factors with the five subscales explaining 49.5% of total variance. For 347 children of nonclinical, pediatric, and psychiatric group, ANOVA showed that any two among the three groups was significantly different in subscales and total difficulties scores, except between pediatric and psychiatric children in emotional problems subscore (p<0.01). The discriminating rate among three groups was 75.5% in discriminant analysis.
Conclusions : The Korean version of SDQ shows very similar psychometric performance to the original SDQ developed by Goodman. This study gives evidence of the usefulness of the SDQ-Kr as a promising screening instrument for epidemiological research and clinical purposes.",안정숙,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3009176
교대근무와 수면,"The rapid industrialization is associated with an increase in shift systems. Sleep problem is a major complaint of shift workers. This study was undertaken as one of a series of researches on shift workers and sleep. The purpose was to understand the sleep pattern and to offer basic data in order to improve a sleep regimen. The sleep log was administered to a relatively homogenous group of 38 psychiatric nurses who were on the two-daily phase delay(day/evening/night) rotating shift schedule. Some possible influencing factors to sleep pattern(age, sex, marital status, work duration, drug use, and physical and psychiatric diseases including sleep disorders) were controlled. The sleep measures were main sleep(starting time, latency, number of awakenings, length and subjective quality). Each measure was analyzed and compared accross the rest times at which the workers can take sleep and nap. Also, the possible relationships between the main sleep(quality and length) and naps(number and length) were analyzed.
The following results are based on the data of 33 of the 38 subjects. Five of the subjects who did not sleep during the rest time after the second night shift were classified seperately.
1) The beginning of the main sleep phase was delayed during the rest times after day, evening, and night shift, while advanced during the rest times after days off.
2) The sleep measures were significantly different across the rest times; for latency(F(7.224)=2.12, p〈.05), quality(F(7.224)=8.97, P〈.001), length(F(7.224)=41.13, p〈.001) of main sleep, and number of nap(F(7.224)=19.27, P〈.001) and length of nap(F(7.224)=12.79, P〈.001). The main sleep taken in the day time after night shift was generally poorer quality and shorter length than that in the night time after day and evening shifts and days off. Nap was relatively longer and more frequent during the rest time after night shifts than during the rest time after day and evening shifts and days off.
3) There were significantly negative relationships between the total length of main sleep and total number of nap(r= -.3632, p〈.001) and between the total length of main sleep and total length of nap(r= -.2253, P〈.001) across the rest times.",이형영,1991,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99768733

한국형 소아우울척도의 개발,"While the previous literature on childhood depression is confusing and contains insufficient and insubstantial research data, recent studies do report that depression in childhood does exist, and the standardized evaluation of children is essential for clinical research. This study I s conducted to develop the Korean form of the ""Kovacs' children's Depression Inventory"" and carries the following four main purposes :
1) To test the reliability of the CDI by means of test-retest reliability, split-half reliability, item0total correlations and internal consistency.
2) To investigate the factor structure of depression among normal Korean children.
3) To examine the differences of response to self-report questionnaire depending on age and sex.
4) To compare the severity of depression of Korean children with that of foreign children.
The results summarized as follows :
1) Two week test-retest(coefficient r=0.71, p<0.001), mean of item-total correlations (coefficient r=0.44, p<0.001) were acceptable, and CDI turned out to be an internally consistent instrument(coefficient r=0.88, p<0.001).
2) Factor analysis using vari-max rotation yielded eight factors.
3) Among school-aged normal children(from 4th to 6th grade), the scores were not(or minimally) related to the respondent's age and sex.
4) The mean scores of CDI of Korean children were higher than those of the foreign children.
These results indicate that firstly, ""Korean form of the Kovacs' Children's Depression Inventory is a reliable instrument, secondly, the structure of depression in Korean children is multidimensional, hardly, this instrument may be used in different school-aged children, and lastly, the cut-off points to make a diagnosis of childhood depression may be different from those of foreign children.
The authors suggest that future research should be directed to get normative data using various populations including clinic population, and concurrent use of ""Children's Depression Rating Scale"" of Lang and Tisher, ""Children's Depression Rating Scale"" of Poznanski or ""School-age Depression Listed Investory"" of Petti and Law will further validate this instrument.",조수철,1990,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99912060

성인원외폐렴의 원인미생물에대한 전향적 다기관 연구,"Background : Communite-acquired peumonia (CAP) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Despite progress in diagnostic techniques and treatments, management of pneumonia remains challenging, because the precise etiology remains uncertain in as many as 49% of cases. The limitaions of identifying etiologic agents make it necessary to use empiric antibiotics in almost all patients, and furthermore emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms pose difficulties to the selection of an empiric antibiotic regimen. For the optimal choice of empirical antibiotics, we should know the frequency of etiologic agents and antimicrobial resistance rates in the community.
Methods : A prospective multicenter study of community-acquired pneumonia in Korea was carried out between May 1997 and April 2000. The microbiologic diagnosis was based on the results of sputum culture, blood culture and pleural culture.
Results : Five hundred eighty eight cases of community-acquired peumonia in 562 patients admitted to the hospitals. The mean age was 59.9 with male predominance (58.3%), and 370 (63%) had underlyin gillness. The etiologic agents were identified in 38.3%, and the list of individual agents, in decreasing order, was Streprococcus pneumoniae (21.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.5%), viridans group streptococci (5.7%), Enterobacter cloacae (4.2%), Hemophillus Influenza (3.8%), The rates of admission to the intensive care unit was 10.4%. The motality was 7.1%. Susceptible rates of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was 36.6% and showed multidrug resistant. Forty percents of S. aureus were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. K. penumoniae were susceptible to cephalosporin and quinolone.
Conclusion : In Korea, S.pneumoniae is the most important agent causing community-acquired pneumonia. Susceptible rates of S. pneumoniae to penicillin was 36.6% and showed multidrug resistant. Gram negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa showed high incidence when compared with that of other countries. Most of them had underlying diseases including bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. (Korean J Infect Dis 33:1∼7, 2001)",우준희,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60156448
