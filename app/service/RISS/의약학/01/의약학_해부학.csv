Wave agents, that is, TGA salt(Thioglycolic acid salt), cysteine, and cysteine, and normal hair and hair bleached with different number of times are selected as the first sample, and the change according to the sample - treating time with wave agents is inspected in terms of shape, epidemiology, and chemistry, In terms of shape, it is inspected with SEM(Scanning Electron Microscope), which looks at the damaged degree of cuticle and change amount of shape of cuticle, and medula. In terms of epidemiology, the change amount of density per volume by hair unit is measured by measuring thickness and weight of hair. In terms of chemistry, by comparing the S content existing in the section of each sample with EDS(Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer), it is confirmed that S content affects to the change of cysteine and cysteinacid content because the response of hair protein, wave agents, and bleach agent happens when SO2 combines. So the correlation of between S change of hair and chemical components of hair can be analogically interpreted. When the section of hair sample is observed with SEM, at normal hair treated with each wave agent, the form of coltex was relatively uniform, However, the damaged hair bleached increasing times shows a noticeable cavity of the part of coltex, that is, hair treated with TGA agent shows the worst damage, and random cavity. As the loss of the part of coltex decreases in the order of cysteine and cysteamine, the hair damage gets larger according to the times of bleach and the kinds of wave agents treated to bleached hair. In the case of sample experiment on the thickness and weight of hair, the thickness of the three-time bleached hair gets thinner by 17% more than normal hair, at the hair treated with TGA agent, the thickness of three ti bleached hair gets thinner by 21% more than normal hair, at the hair treated with cysteine agent, the thickness of three time bleached hair gets thinner by 19% more than nod hair, and at the Mr treated with cystearnine, it gets thinner by 12% more than nod hair.

Proliferation of Hepatic Oval Cells via Cyclooxygenase-2 and Extracellular Matrix Protein Signaling during Liver Regeneration Following 2-AAF/Partial Hepatectomy in Rats,"Background/Aims: In the 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF)/ 70% partial hepatectomy (PHx) model, the mechanism underlying the differentiation of activated hepatic oval cells (HOCs) into hepatocytes and bile ductile cells is unclear. We investigated the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in HOCs and the relationship between COX-2 and extracellular matrix proteins in cellular proliferation. Methods: Reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemical staining, and Western blotting were used to assess COX-2 expression. The co-localization of COX-2 with Thy1, c-Met, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and a-smooth muscle actin was also examined. Additionally, we investigated whether connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), fibronectin (FN), extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (P-ERK1/2), and AKT were expressed in HOCs. Results: The expression of COX-2, prostaglandin E2 receptors, and c-Met was upregulated in HOCs. However, HOCs treated with the COX-2 inhibitor NS398 showed decreased COX-2, CTGF, FN, and AKT expression, whereas P-ERK1/2 was unaffected. Additionally, NS398 inhibited HOC proliferation, but not the proliferation of HOCs cultured on FN-coated dishes. Furthermore, the proliferative response of HOCs treated with NS398 was reversed by hepatic growth factor treatment. Conclusions: These results suggest that HOC proliferation is mediated through COX-2, extracellular FN expression, and AKT activation. Thus, COX-2 plays an important role in HOC proliferation following acute injury. (Gut Liver 2011;5:367-376)",( Si Hyun Bae ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A77004966
"Review : NASH is an Infl ammatory Disorder: Pathogenic, Prognostic and Therapeutic Implications","While non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent (15% to 45%) in modern societies, only 10% to 25% of cases develop hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from pre-existing fibrosis, the strongest predictor of fibrotic progression in NAFLD is steatohepatitis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The critical features other than steatosis are hepatocellular degeneration (ballooning, Mallory hyaline) and mixed infl ammatory cell infi ltration. While much is understood about the relationship of steatosis to metabolic factors (over-nutrition, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, hypoadiponectinemia), less is known about infl ammatory recruitment, despite its importance for the perpetuation of liver injury and fi brogenesis. In this review, we present evidence that liver infl ammation has prognostic signifi cance in NAFLD. We then consider the origins and components of liver infl ammation in NASH. Hepatocytes injured by toxic lipid molecules (lipotoxicity) play a central role in the recruitment of innate immunity involving Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Kupffer cells (KCs), lymphocytes and neutrophils and possibly infl ammasome. The key pro-infl ammatory signaling pathways in NASH are nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-¥êB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The downstream effectors include adhesion molecules, chemokines, cytokines and the activation of cell death pathways leading to apoptosis. The upstream activators of NF-¥êB and JNK are more contentious and may depend on the experimental model used. TLRs are strong contenders. It remains possible that infl ammation in NASH originates outside the liver and in the gut microbiota that prime KC/TLR responses, infl amed adipose tissue and circulating infl ammatory cells. We briefl y review these mechanistic considerations and project their implications for the effective treatment of NASH. (Gut Liver 2012;6:149-171)",( Geoffrey C.

Review : Helicobacter pylori and Gastric Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue (MALT) Lymphoma: Updated Review of Clinical Outcomes and the Molecular Pathogenesis,"In most H. pylori-positive patients, gastric low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas regress both endoscopically and histopathologically after H. pylori eradication, but no factors that can be predictive of the response to the eradication have been definitively identified, and there is little information on how to determine the optimal observation period before additional treatment can be started. Here, clinical studies dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of gastric MALT lymphomas and H. pylori published during the last 5 years were systematically reviewed, and studies identifying the molecular approaches involved in the pathogenesis were summarized. Most of the clinical studies indicate a favorable effect of H. pylori eradication on the clinical outcome of gastric MALT lymphomas. Some studies suggest the necessity of additional treatment in nonresponders to H. pylori eradication, while others suggest the adoption of a watch-and-wait strategy. The molecular characteristics of MALT lymphomas could play an important role in prognostic prediction and the selection of further therapeutic intervention after the eradication. This updated review of gastric MALT lymphomas illustrates the potential efficacy of H. pylori eradication in tumor remission, but further molecular characterization is necessary to establish the most suitable therapeutic strategy for patients who do not respond to eradication.

However, the effects of vitamin D3 have not been investigated in gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. In the present study, we found that vitamin D3 treatment significantly suppressed the viability of gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma cells. Moreover, vitamin D3 had a synergistic effect with other anti-cancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, adriamycin, and vinblastine, for suppressing cell viability. To determine the underlying mechanism involved in the regulation of viability by vitamin D3, we examined the effects of vitamin D3 on expression of hedgehog signaling target genes, which has been associated with gastric cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. Vitamin D3 treatment decreased the level of mRNA expression of patched1, Gli1, cyclin D1, and Bcl2, suggesting the possibility that vitamin D3 may act through regulation of hedgehog signaling.

However, this therapy is expensive, and estimations of the number of chronic HCV-infected (CHC) patients and their treatment costs pre-2013 are therefore essential for creating policies and expanding drug access. Herein, we aimed to investigate the number of HCV-related liver disease patients, their healthcare utilization, their annual direct medical costs, and the interferon-based antiviral treatment rates and costs from 2009 to 2013 in South Korea. Methods: The National Health Insurance database was reviewed, and patients diagnosed with CHC from 2009 to 2013 were extracted. Data regarding detailed healthcare utilization, prescribed drugs, and direct medical costs were obtained. For annual direct healthcare cost calculations, a prevalence-based approach was used. Results: Overall, 181,768 CHC patients were identified. In 2013, the annual per-patient costs for chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the first year post-liver transplant were 895, 1,873, 6,945, and 67,359 United States dollars, respectively. Interferon-based antiviral therapeutics were prescribed to 25,223 patients (13.9%). Conclusions: Healthcare costs have increased remarkably with increasing liver disease severity.

"Review : Celiac Disease: A Disorder Emerging from Antiquity, Its Evolving Classification and Risk, and Potential New Treatment Paradigms","Celiac disease is a chronic genetically based gluten-sensitive immune-mediated enteropathic process primarily affecting the small intestinal mucosa. The disorder classically presents with diarrhea and weight loss; however, more recently, it has been characterized by subclinical occult or latent disease associated with few or no intestinal symptoms. Diagnosis depends on the detection of typical histopathological biopsy changes followed by a gluten-free diet response. A broad range of clinical disorders may mimic celiac disease, along with a wide range of drugs and other therapeutic agents. Recent and intriguing archeological data, largely from the Gobleki Tepe region of the Fertile Crescent, indicate that celiac disease probably emerged as humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer groups to societies dependent on agriculture to secure a stable food supply. Longitudinal studies performed over several decades have suggested that changes in the prevalence of the disease, even apparent epidemic disease, may be due to superimposed or novel environmental factors that may precipitate its appearance. Recent therapeutic approaches are being explored that may supplement, rather than replace, gluten-free diet therapy and permit more nutritional options for future management.

Review : Evolutionary History of the Helicobacter pylori Genome: Implications for Gastric Carcinogenesis,"The genome of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori has evolved over the millennia since its migration out of Africa along with its human host approximately 60,000 years ago. Human migrations, after thousands of years of permanent settlement in those lands, resulted in seven prototypes of genetic populations of H. pylori with distinct geographical distributions. In all continents, present day isolates of H. pylori have molecular markers that refl ect population migrations. The colonization of the Americas as well as the slave trade introduced European and African strains to the New World. The relationship between H. pylori genome and gastric cancer rates is linked to the presence of the cagA gene, but the knowledge on this subject is incomplete because other genes may be involved in certain populations. A new situation for Homo sapiens is the absence of H. pylori colonization in certain, mostly affluent, populations, apparently brought about by improved home sanitation and widespread use of antibiotics during the last decades. The disappearance of H. pylori from the human microbiota may be linked to emerging epidemics of esophageal adenocarcinoma, some allergic diseases such as asthma and some autoimmune disorders.

For example, growth of specific organ or part of body, and morphogenesis and development during individual growth process are mainly emerged Morphogenesis is a growing divergence process as cells are gradually diverse. Therefore, reversely, the original cell has a potential ability to be diverged into various cells. This is known as pluripotentiality, not peculiar for embryo period. For instance, while blood cells are produced through whole life, various blood cells are diverged from common forefather cell. Because forefather cell produce pluripotentiality cells like itself as well as differentiated cells, the original character does not disappear. Likewise, the cell that has pluipotentiality and reproduction ability is called stem cell. Stem cells exist in any organization that vigorously reproduce not only blood cells but also alimentary canal »óÇÇ and skin after birth.

Terminal bifurcation of the external jugular vein: a rare variation,"Variations of external jugular vein are common. Here, we present a rare terminal bifurcation of the left external jugular vein. The left external jugular vein was formed by the union of entire retromandibular vein and posterior auricular vein. One inch above the clavicle, it bifurcated into medial and lateral divisions. The medial division terminated into the internal jugular vein and the lateral division terminated into the subclavian vein. Medial division received a common vein formed by the union of anterior jugular vein and an anonymous vein lying under the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The lateral division received a common vein formed by the union of suprascapular and transverse cervical veins. The knowledge about this variation could be useful to head and neck surgeons, radiologists and plastic surgeons.",Satheesha Badagabettu Nayak,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A77034367
Bilateral sternocleidomastoid variant with six distinct insertions along the superior nuchal line,"Anatomical variations of the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) have been observed to occupy multiple origins and insertion points and have supernumerary heads, sometimes varying in thickness. During routine dissection, a SCM was observed to have six distinct insertions that interface with the course of the superior nuchal line, ending at the midline, bilaterally. This variation was also seen to receive innervation from the accessory nerve as well as the great auricular nerve. To our knowledge, this variant of supernumerary insertions and nerve innervations has not yet been reported. These variants may pose as problematic during surgical approaches to the upper neck and occiput, and should thus be appreciated by the clinician. Herein we discuss the case report, possible embryological origins, and the clinical significance of the observed variant SCM.",Graham Dupont,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75265988
The Relationship between Quiescent Infl ammatory Bowel Disease and Peripheral Polyneuropathy,"Background/Aims: Infl ammatory bowel disease is a chronic, recurrent disorder that involves multiple organ systems. Polyneuropathy is the most common neurological manifestation. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between polyneuropathy and infl ammatory bowel disease. Methods: The study included 40 patients with infl ammatory bowel disease (20 with ulcerative colitis and 20 with Crohn`s disease) and 24 healthy controls. The patients had no clinical signs or symptoms of polyneuropathy. Nerve conduction studies were performed using an electroneuromyography apparatus. Results: Mean distal motor latencies, conduction velocities, and F wave minimum latencies of the right median nerve were signifi cantly abnormal in the patient group, compared to the healthy controls (p<0.05). Conclusions: Some electrophysiological alterations were observed in chronic infl ammatory bowel disease patients who showed no clinical signs. While investigating extra-intestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease patients, nerve conduction studies must be performed to identify electrophysiological changes and subclinical peripheral polyneuropathy, which can subsequently develop.

Evaluation and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy: Current Status and Future Directions,"Hepatic encephalopathy is a spectrum of neurocognitive manifestations often seen in patients with liver injury or rarely in patients with portosystemic shunting without liver injury. It can be divided into minimal (covert) hepatic encephalopathy and overt hepatic encephalopathy, depending on the severity. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy have compromised clinical outcomes, decreased quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization, often resulting in a heavy financial and personal burden on caregivers. The diagnosis remains largely clinical, with the exclusion of possible other causes for the altered mental status. Current treatment strategies include nonabsorbable disaccharides and antibiotics. This review will focus on the diagnosis, management and clinical impact of hepatic encephalopathy. (Gut Liver 2016;10:509-519)",( Duminda Suraweera ),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107324653

Review : Gut Microbiota as Potential Orchestrators of Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial functional disorder with no clearly defined etiology or pathophysiology. Modern culture-independent techniques have improved the understanding of the gut microbiota¡¯s composition and demonstrated that an altered gut microbiota profile might be found in at least some subgroups of IBS patients. Research on IBS from a microbial perspective is gaining momentum and advancing. This review will therefore highlight potential links between the gut microbiota and IBS by discussing the current knowledge of the gut microbiota; it will also illustrate bacterial-host interactions and how alterations to these interactions could exacerbate, induce or even help alleviate IBS.

generation of carbon monoxide (CO), biliverdin, and free iron. HO-1 has been known to show strong immunosuppressive
properties although its mechanisms are not completely understood. In this study, it was therefore investigated
anti-inflammatory properties of HO-1 in HT-29 cell, human colonic epithelial cell line.
CoPPIX, HO-1 inducer, induced HO-1 expression without NF-¥êB activation and significantly blocked the I¥êB-¥á
degradation by TNF-¥á in HT-29. Inhibition of HO-1 activity by ZnPPIX reversed the suppressive effects of CoPPIX
on I¥êB-¥á degradation by TNF-¥á. Calcium chelating agent BAPTA/AM and calcium channel blockers, Verapamil and
Flunarizine suppressed I¥êB-¥á degradation by TNF-¥á in HT-29 cells like CoPPIX while calcium ionophore A23187
also dose-dependently reversed the suppressive effects of CoPPIX on I¥êB-¥á degradation by TNF-¥á like a ZnPPIX.
Interestingly, treatment of ZnPPIX increased basal intracellular calcium in HT-29 cells.
Collectively, these results suggest that HO-1 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulation of NF-¥êB activity

The ascending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery penetrating the posterior division of the femoral nerve,"Understanding anatomic variations in neurovascular structure inside the femoral triangle is crucial for regional anesthesiologists performing femoral nerve block. During routine dissection of a cadaver, an ascending branch of the lateral circumflex femoral artery with an anomalous course passing through the femoral nerve, specifically the posterior division, was identified inside the femoral triangle on the left thigh. The novel variation identified in this study occurred in an early stage of prenatal development. Recognition of this anatomic variation will be helpful for reducing unexpected complications during the femoral nerve block and the tensor fascia latae flap. Penetration of the posterior division of the femoral nerve by the arterial branch might cause pain or paresthesia of the medial aspect of the leg in the distribution of the saphenous nerve.",Hankyu Kim,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99535526
"Ibrutinib reduces neutrophil infiltration, preserves neural tissue and enhances locomotor recovery in mouse contusion model of spinal cord injury","Following acute spinal cord injury (SCI), excessive recruitment of neutrophils can result in inflammation, neural tissue loss and exacerbation of neurological outcomes. Ibrutinib is a bruton¡¯s tyrosine kinase inhibitor in innate immune cells such as the neutrophils that diminishes their activation and influx to the site of injury. The present study evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib administration in the acute phase of SCI on neural tissue preservation and locomotor recovery. Ibrutinib was delivered intravenously at 3.125 mg/kg either immediately, 12 hours after, or both immediately and 12 hours after SCI induction in adult male C57BL/6 mice. Neutrophil influx into the lesion area was evaluated 24 hours following SCI using light microscopy and immunohistochemistry methods. Animals¡¯ body weight changes were recorded, and their functional motor recovery was assessed based on the Basso mouse scale during 28 days after treatment. Finally, spinal cord lesion volume was estimated by an unbiased stereological method. While animals¡¯ weight in the control group started to increase one week after injury, it stayed unchanged in treatment groups. However, the double injection of ibrutinib led to a significantly lower body weight compared to the control group at 4 weeks post-injury. Mean neutrophil counts per visual field and the lesion volume were significantly decreased in all ibrutinib-treated groups. In addition, ibrutinib significantly improved locomotor functional recovery in all treated groups, especially in immediate and double-injection groups. Neural tissue protection and locomotor functional recovery suggest ibrutinib treatment as a potent immunotherapeutic intervention for traumatic SCI that warrants clinical testing.",Somayyeh Torabi,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A77021373
An anatomical investigation of the suboccipital- and inferior suboccipital triangles,"The suboccipital triangle (ST) is a clinically relevant landmark in the posterior aspect of the neck and isused to locate and mobilize the horizontal segment of the third part of the vertebral artery before it enters the cranium. Unfortunately, this space is not always a viable option for vertebral artery exposition, and consequently a novel triangle, the inferior suboccipital triangle (IST) has been defined. This alternative triangle will allow surgeons to locate the artery more proximally, where its course is more predictable. The purpose of this study was to better define the anatomy of both triangles by measuring their borders and calculating their areas. Ethical clearance was obtained from the University of Pretoria (reference number: 222/2021) and both triangles were subsequently dissected out on both the left and right sides of 33 formalin-fixed human adult cadavers. The borders of each triangle were measured using a digital calliper and the areas were calculated using Herons Formula. The average area of the ST is 969.82¡¾153.15 mm2, while the average area of the ISTis 307.48¡¾41.31 mm 2 . No statistically significant differences in the findings were observed between the sides of the body,ancestry, or sex of the cadavers. Measurement and analysis of these triangles provided important anatomical information and speak to their clinical relevance as surgical landmarks with which to locate the vertebral artery. Of particular importance here is the IST, which allows for mobilisation of this artery more proximally, should the ST be occluded.",Kirsten Shannon Regan,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99940676
"Expression of ErbB4 in the neurons of Alzheimer¡¯s disease brain and APP/PS1 mice, a model of Alzheimer¡¯s disease","Neuregulin-1 (NRG1) plays important roles in the development and plasticity of the brain, and has also been reported to exhibit potent neuroprotective properties. Although ErbB4, a key NRG1 receptor, is expressed in multiple regions in the adult animal brain, little is known about its role in Alzheimer¡¯s disease (AD). AD is characterized by progressive impairment of cognition and behavioral disturbance that strongly correlate with degeneration and death of neurons in the cerebral cortex and limbic brain areas, such as the hippocampus and the amygdala. Here, we show that the ErbB4 and phospho- ErbB4 immunoreactivities were higher intensity in the neurons of the CA1-2 transitional fi eld of AD brains as compared to age-matched controls. Also, ErbB4 expression was increased in the neurons of the cortico medial nucleus amygdala, human basal forebrain and superior frontal gyrus of AD brains. In cerebral cortex and hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 double transgenic mice, ErbB4 immunoreactivity significantly increased in comparison to age-matched wild type control. These results suggest that up-regulating of ErbB4 immunoreactivity may involve in the progression of pathology of AD.",Ran-Sook Woo,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104182101
Apoptotic Effect of Co-treatment with Chios Gum Mastic and HS-1200 on G361 Human Melanoma Cell Line,"Chios gum mastic (CGM) is a resinous exudate obtained from the stem and the main leaves of Pistacia lenticulus tree native to Mediterranean areas. Recently it reported that CGM induce apoptosis in a few cancer cells in vitro. Bile acids and their synthetic derivatives induced apoptosis in various kinds of cancer cells and anticancer effects. It has been reported that the synthetic chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) derivatives showed apoptosis-inducing activity on various cancer cells in vitro. This study was undertaken to investigate the synergistic apoptotic effect of cotreatment with a natural product, CGM and a CDCA derivative, HS-1200 on G361 human melanoma cells. To investigate whether the co-treatment of CGM and HS-1200 compared with each single treatment efficiently reduced the viability of G361 cells, MTT assay was conducted. To investigate augmentation of apoptosis in G631 cells co-treated with CGM and HS-1200, DNA electrophoresis, Hoechst staining, proteasome activity assay, flow cytometry, Westen blot analyses, immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopy were performed. In this study, G361 cells co-treated with CGM and HS-1200 showed several lines of apoptotic manifestation such as nuclear condensations, DNA fragmentation, the reduction of MMP and proteasome activity, the decrease of DNA content, the release of cytochrome c into cytosol, the translocation of AIF and DFF40 (CAD) onto nuclei, activation of caspase-9, caspase-3, PARP and DFF45 (ICAD), and up-regulation of Bax whereas each single treated G361 cells did not. Although the single treatment of 40 ¥ìg/mL CGM or 25 ¥ìM HS-1200 for 24 hrs did not induce apoptosis, the co-treatment of them induced prominently apoptosis. Therefore, combination therapy of CGM and HS-1200 could be considered, in the future, as an alternative therapeutic strategy for human melanoma.",Young-Joo Hur,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A77004908
A rare cadaveric case of a duplicated internal thoracic artery,"The internal thoracic artery (ITA) arises from the subclavian artery and terminates as the musculophrenic and inferior epigastric arteries.

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of this particular ITA variation arising from the third part of the subclavian artery. Additionally, such a variant might also be considered a high bifurcation of the ITA.

A one-month-old female presented with irritability and failure to thrive. She was the product of a 35-week pregnancy and was delivered vaginally without complications or a difficult labor. Based on the findings of magnetic resonance imaging, the diagnosis of a giant dAVF involving the transerve-sigmoid sinuses was made. The patient was scheduled for an arteriogram but died before the procedure could be performed. Such a case illustrates how large some dAVF can become and at a very early age.

We present a case of bilateral TA muscle variations that diverge slightly from the current classification systems of this muscle. Recognizing variations such as these may be important for anatomists, surgeons, podiatrists, and physicians. Following routine dissection, an accessory tendon of the TA muscle was found on both sides. Accessory tendons of the extensor hallucis longus and extensor hallucis brevis joined to form a common tendon on both sides. We believe that this unique case will help further the classification systems for the tendons of the TA and also be informative for clinical anatomists as well as physicians treating patients with pathology in this region.",Jenilkumar Patel(Jenilkumar Patel ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A77004982
