
청소년기 10대 임신에서 임산부와 신생아의 주산기 문제점,"Purpose: The number of teenage pregnancy is increasing on these days due to changes in sexual awareness, precocious puberty,lack of proper sex education and abortion restrictions. We evaluated the clinical features including the rate and perinatal complications of mother and neonates caused by teenage births.
Methods: Subjects were mothers whose ages were below 19 at time of admission in Wonkwang University Hospital from January 2000 to July 2011. We reviewed the medical records of teenage mothers and her neonates retrospectively, and investigated the differences between above and below the age of 16 .
Results: The number of neonates of teenaged mothers was 73, which is 10.4 per 1,000 births and it showed an upward trend during the late decade of 2,000’s. 14 (19.2%) of the mothers were multiparous, and 69 (94.5%) unmarried, 25 (34.2%) no prenatal examinations, 11 (15.1%) an abortion history, 47 (64.4%) middle or high school students, and 25 (34.2%) a single parent. Among the maternal complications, premature birth was the most prevalent with 34 cases (46.6%), followed by 11 (4.1%) of premature rupture of membrane. The most common neonatal complication was prematurity in 37 cases (50.7%), followed by 30 (41.1%) low birth weight, 19 (26%) ICU admission. There were no significant differences between above and below the age of 16 in neonatal and obstetrical complications.
Conclusion: The number of teenage pregnancy is increasing recently, and they had a high prevalence rate of prematurity, low birth weight and respiratory distress syndrome. And, the grouping by age of above and below 16 was no affect the prognosis.",박인호,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76521054

신생아에서 채혈 시 음악제공이 통증행동 반응에 미치는 효과,"Purpose: We studied this study to see the effect of hearing music on response to pain during needling. We hypothesized that music would reduce pain in newborns.
Methods: Twenty term and near-term newborns were enrolled for the study. They were admitted to neonatal intensive care unit of Hanyang University Guri Hospital from May 1, 2011 to September 30, 2011. We evaluated pain response to needling, such as arterial puncture or heel prick, by using Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS; facial expression, crying, breathing patterns, arms, legs, state of arousal) and duration of crying through video recording. We started video recording when the newborns were stable with 0 score of NIPS, and continued for 3 minutes after needling. Each newborn took video-recordings in 2 separate periods. One was done with hearing music (Music group) and the other without music (Control group). Two observers reviewed the videotapes and gave final scores in agreement. T-test was done for comparisons of pain scale and duration of crying between music and control groups.
Results: Mean age and hospital days at test of the subjects were 6±5 days of life (1-16 days of life) and 3±2 days, respectively. Twenty-one of 40 needlings (52.5%) for blood sample were from radial arterial puncture and 19 (47.5%) from heel prick. The music group had lower NIPS score than the controls (5.6±1.1 vs 6.5±0.7, P=0.006). Among the NIPS parameters, the music group had lower scores in crying and arm (crying, 1.6±0.5 vs 1.9±0.3, P=0.028; arm, 0.3±0.5 vs 0.7±0.5, P=0.01) parameters. The remaining parameters such as facial expression, leg, breathing patterns and state of arousal, and duration of crying were not significantly different in 2 groups.
Conclusion: c reduced pain response to needling in newborns. Music could be one of modalities to relieve pain during routine medical procedures in newborns.",오혜린,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101599049

감염 후 폐쇄세기관지염 소아 환자의 면역학적 병인 분석,"Purpose: This study aimed to analyze the immunologic profile of children with postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans (PIBO) in order to approach pathophysiology affected by host factors.
Methods: A total of 10 children with PIBO were prospectively enrolled. We obtained information on demographics from their caregiver and electric medical records. Peripheral blood samples were collected before cyclic systemic methylprednisolone therapy and complete blood count, immunoglobulin level and lymphocyte subset were analyzed.
Results: The white blood cell count and immunoglobulin level were within the normal range in children with PIBO. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio was not significantly different from those of the healthy control group. A decreased proportion of both central memory T cells (median [interquartile range]; 13.5% [8.3%-16.3%] vs. 18.5% [15.9%-24.1%], P=0.01) and effector memory T cells (10.3% [5.0%-18.4%] vs. 20.9% [16.6%-26.3%], P=0.03) in CD4+T cells was observed in the PIBO group compared with those in the control group. In CD8+T cells, the proportion of effector memory T cells (7.8% [4.2%-13.8%] vs. 24.3% [15.3%-27.9%], P=0.02) and CD45RA+effector memory T cells (16.2% [11.0%-36.6%] vs. 24.2% [17.1%-39.7%], P=0.04) was decreased in the patient group compared with the control group.
Conclusion: It is suggested that T lymphocyte subset abnormalities may be associated with a decrease in the ability to differentiate the T cells immediately upon reinfection and induce an effective response to infection. These results may partially explain the pathophysiological individual vulnerabilities to PIBO after lower respiratory tract infections in children.

소아 천식 환자에서 몰입형 가상현실을 이용한 환경관리 교육,"Purpose: Awareness of environmental control is considered a major influence on the performance of asthma self-management behaviors that are involved in maintaining effective control of asthma. The aim of this study was to investigate whether immersive virtual reality (VR) education is effective in environmental control education for asthmatic children.
Methods: Thirty asthmatic children aged 9 to 13 years with aeroallergen sensitization were enrolled. Environmental control education for asthmatic subjects were performed using either immersive VR (VR group) or conventional leaflets provided by asthma specialists (control group). Five questionnaires, such as awareness of environmental control, memory, assessment of intent to act, satisfaction test, and asthma control test (ACT) questionnaires were used for estimating the effects of education.
Results: Awareness of environmental control, memory, and intent to act scores were significantly increased after education in both groups and the scores were maintained high until 4 weeks after education. In both group, ACT scores were maintained high scores before and 4 weeks after education. Satisfaction scores were very high in the VR group.
Conclusion: The increased scores in awareness of environmental control and intent to act indicate that the environmental control education using VR is worthy of attention as an effective educational tool for asthma management. Application of further developed techniques, including active environmental intervention by participants in VR, could be applied to effective asthma management.

소아 천식 조절 지표로서의 기관지확장제반응의 유용성,"Purpose: Assessing asthma control is important for proper management, and various indices for objective assessment of asthma control, such as fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and asthma control test (ACT) score have been proposed. Recently, bronchodilator response (BDR) was reported as a marker of poor asthma control in adults. This study aimed to assess the usefulness of BDR as a biomarker for childhood asthma.
Methods: A total of 305 children diagnosed with asthma were included. Spirometry with bronchodilator test was done at the time of diagnosis and about 14 months after asthma treatment. All children were evaluated by childhood asthma control test (c-ACT) and FeNO after asthma treatment. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to BDR results: the positive and negative BDR groups. Various biomarkers for asthma control, such as c-ACT, FeNO and changes of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), were compared between the 2 groups.
Results: Of the 305 patients, 143 (46.9%) were positive and 162 (53.1%) were negative for BDR. The BDR-positive group showed lower FEV1. In the BDR positive group, FEV1 was significantly increased after asthma treatment, especially in children with airflow limitation which was defined as below 80% of FEV1 or atopy. In atopic children, BDR showed a significant negative correlation with c-ACT and a positive correlation with FeNO.
Conclusion: In asthmatic children with airflow limitation at the time of diagnosis, BDR can be a useful index for predicting improvement in lung function by asthma maintenance treatment. BDR could be a reliable marker for the assessment of asthma control in atopic children.",김종덕,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100299060
꽃가루 생태변화와 소아청소년 알레르기비염에 관한 고찰,"Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a type of rhinitis accompanied by sensitization to allergens. One of the most clinically important allergens is pollen. Recently, due to climate change and CO2 air pollution, the flowering period starts earlier and persists longer. In addition, antigenicity due to environmental pollution is also being strengthened. As a result, the sensitization rate to pollen antigens is on the rise. It is known that the prevalence of AR especially caused by pollen is rapidly escalating. Although the causal relationship between pollen exposure and the severity of rhinitis is not precisely established, an association of rhinitis symptoms with the time of pollen scattering exists. In addition, the mixed effect of environmental pollution and pollen may play a role in the development of rhinitis symptoms. Therefore, in order to avoid pollen, it is necessary to constantly improve pollen forecast and minimize the contact with pollen indoors and outdoors. Treatment of AR should be performed according to guidelines. Also, continuous efforts to solve the environmental problems affecting the ecology of pollen are needed.",이경석,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100299065
소아 대·소엽성 폐렴의 임상 양상 및 원인에 대한 고찰,"Purpose : We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and etiological organisms associated with lobar/lobular pneumonia in Korean children.
Methods : Children hospitalized due to radiographically confirmed lobar/lobular pneumonia were evaluated prospectively between June 2006 and May 2008. Anti-Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM/IgG (at admission and follow-up), blood cultures, throat swabs for bacterial detection or sputum culture, respiratory viruses (Respiratory syncytial virus, Adenovirus and Influenza A/B) antigen testing, and urinary antigen testing for S. pneumoniae were performed.
Results : Two hundred eighty-eight immunocompetent children (mean age, 5.9 years) were enrolled. The age distribution showed a peak frequency at 2-6 years of age (＜2 years, 8.7%; 2-6 years, 60.8%; 7-10 years, 22.6%; 11-15 years, 8.0%). Typical respiratory organisms were identified in 64.9% of cases. Identified organisms were Mycoplasma pneumoniae (50.7%), bacteria in (5.9%), viruses (2.1%) and mixed infection (5.9%). Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most commonly identified organism in all age groups. The majority (88.9%) of bacterial pneumonias including mixed infection were caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Mycoplasma pneumonia was the most frequent at 5-6 years of age, but bacterial pneumonia was most frequent at 1-2 years of age. Lobar/lobular pneumonia began to increase from August and showed peak incidence in November and December. The levels of WBC, ESR, and CRP more significantly elevated in those with bacterial pneumonia than in children with mycoplasma pneumonia. Pleural effusion was present in 18.1% of cases. In these cases, the duration of fever and hospitalization was prolonged, and the ESR and CRP levels were significantly higher, than those without pleural effusion.
Conclusion : Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most common organism causing lobar/lobular pneumonia in children. Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent causative organism at 5-6 years of age. On the other hand, bacterial pneumonia was more common at 1-2 years of age. Thus, age may be a significant factor for the diagnosis and treatment of lobar/lobular pneumonia in children.",이윤희,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99577614
성조숙증 아동의 임상 및 내분비 검사의 특징,"Purpose : Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of secondary sexual characteristics before 8 year of age in girls and 9 year in boys. The purpose of this study is to analyze the spectrum of diagnoses made in a consecutive group of children referred for signs of precocious puberty and evaluate the clinical and endocrinologic characteristics of patients with precocious puberty.
Methods : The charts of all 948 children referred for evaluation of signs of precocious puberty between January 2003 and June 2007 in several referral centers were reviewed. Clinical features including age of onset, presenting symptoms, yearly growth rate, bone age advancement, weight, height, and body mass index were analysed and endocrine investigations included basal and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) as well as sex hormones.
Results : Of the 948 children referred for signs of precocious puberty, 915 (96.5%) were female and 33 (3.5%) were male. The final diagnoses made were early puberty (39%), premature thelarche (31%), true precocious puberty (27%) and precocious pseudopuberty (1%). The increases in yearly growth rate and bone age advancement were significant in true precious puberty group (P<0.05). The height and weight standard deviation score were significantly increased in true precious puberty and premature thelarche group compared to the average level according to gender and age (P<0.05). Endocrinologic studies showed that the level of basal LH, basal estradiol and GnRH-stimulated peak LH, peak FSH, peak LH/basal LH, peak FSH/basal FSH, peak LH/peak FSH ratio was all significantly higher in true precicous puberty group and early puberty group when compared to premature thelarche group (P<0.05). Neurogenic true precocious puberty among true precocious puberty was more common in boys (3 out of 7, 42.8%) than in girls (27 out of 253, 10.7%). Endocrinologic studies did not show any difference between idiopathic precocious puberty and neurogenic precocious puberty.
Conclusion : The result of this study showed the proportion of true precocious puberty among the children referred for early pubertal signs was rather high. Collectively assessing all available data including detailed history, growth records, physical findings, laboratory studies and radiological imaging is important in the evaluation of a child with concerns of early pubertal maturation.

생후 90일 미만 영아의 요로 감염에서 세균성 수막염의 동반 가능성,"Purpose: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common serious bacterial infections in young infants. Lumbar puncture (LP) has been used to diagnose coexisting meningitis in infants under 90 days of age with suspected UTI in many hospitals. However, the incidence of bacterial meningitis associated with UTIs is low. We aimed to describe the prevalence of concomitant bacterial meningitis in young infants with UTIs. Methods: The medical records of infants with the first episode of UTI admitted to the Chung-Ang University Hospital from January 2010 to December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Infants aged < 90 days who underwent LP with initial evaluation were included. Demographic and clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging findings were collected and analyzed. Results: Eighty-six infants with UTIs were enrolled in the study. The median age was 61.5 days (interquartile range, 42.3-73.8 days) and boys (90.7%) were predominant. Escherichia coli was the most common pathogen (n=80, 93.0%) and followed by Klebsiella species (n=5, 5.8%). Fifteen (18.1%) specimens produced extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). Five (5.8%) infants had positive blood culture results. Seven (8.1%) infants showed pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, but none had coexisting bacterial meningitis. Twenty-four (30.8%) infants showed renal dilatation or hydronephrosis on ultrasonography. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scans revealed cortical defects in 17 (21.3%) infants while voiding cystourethrography revealed vesicoureteral reflux in 6 (46.2%) infants. Conclusion: Co-existing bacterial meningitis was not observed in young infants with UTIs.

This study aimed to analyze the change and trajectories of allergen sensitization in children with respiratory and allergic diseases.
Methods: From 2006 to 2020, children with respiratory and allergic diseases or screened for allergic sensitization were evaluated. We visualized the alterations and the trajectories of allergen sensitization using stacked area graphs, box plots, and Sankey diagrams.
Results: A total of 2,804 subjects were included, and allergic rhino-conjunctivitis was diagnosed in 1,931 children (68.9%). The mean age for the first test was 4.1 years, and that for the second test was 6.5 years. Children sensitized to class 1 food allergen before age 5 showed sensitizations more for other allergens and at a younger age after age 5 than children who were not. The atopic tendency continued once it had been obtained before the early school age in the persistence or the new development of sensitization.
Conclusion: Allergen sensitization has changed over time and has shown different patterns according to age. Its trajectory has taken a wide variety of courses in children with respiratory and allergic diseases until the early school age.

급성모세기관지염의 원인 바이러스에 따른 중증도 차이,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the severity of disease in children with acute bronchiolitis according to the type of infected virus.
Methods: From November 2007 to May 2015, 768 patients under 2 years of age who underwent real time-polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal aspirates admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of Dongguk University Ilsan Hospital for acute bronchiolitis were enrolled. Severe bronchiolitis was defined as presence of one or more kinds among tachypnea, chest retraction, needs of O2 inhalation or ventilator care.
Results: The severity of bronchiolitis was increased with shorter fever duration (P<0.001) and previous wheezing episodes (P=0.005). In the case of single infection, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A only increased the severity of acute bronchiolitis (P=0.012).

The allergic rhinitis group was older than the nonallergic rhinitis group or the nonrhinitis group (7.73±2.85 vs. 5.97±2.48 vs. 6.12±2.70, P<0.001). Nasal itching sense was more prevalent in the allergic-rhinitis group than in the nonallergic rhinitis group (3.23±1.90 vs. 2.44±1.56, P=0.036). There was an inverse correlation between the rhinitis and C-ACT (r= -0.329, P<0.05). Of note, nasal obstruction symptom was highly correlated with C-ACT (r=-0.334, P<0.001). Conclusion: Allergic rhinitis and nonallergic rhinitis were highly prevalent in the pediatric patients with asthma and both of them had a significantly adverse impact on asthma control by rhinitis-itself. Therefore, regardless of atopic status, clinicians should focus on relieving rhinitis symptoms.

급성 세기관지염 연관 응급실 재방문의 위험인자,"Purpose: Acute bronchiolitis (AB)-related return visits incur overuse of emergency medicine resources, crowding of emergency departments (EDs), and deterioration of rapport with the guardians. The authors aimed to analyze factors associated with the return visits to the ED.
Methods: This study was conducted based on the medical records of 447 children aged 24 months or younger with AB who visited the ED from January 2019 through December 2020. A return visit was defined as an AB-related visit to the ED within 7 days of index visit. According to the return visit, we compared the clinical features. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify independent factors for the return visit.
Results: Of the 323 children with AB, 77 (23.8%) made return visits. The returning children showed a younger median age (6 [interquartile range, 2-10] vs. 8 months [3-14]; P < 0.001), a lower mean oxyhemoglobin saturation (92.9 ± 4.3% vs. 97.1 ± 1.8%; P < 0.001), and higher frequencies of congenital heart diseases (22.1% vs. 10.6%; P = 0.009) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (11.7% vs. 5.7%; P = 0.013), and respiratory syncytial virus infection (57.1% vs. 37.0%; P = 0.002). No other variables, such as the hospitalization rate, differed as per return visits. The factors associated with return visits were respiratory syncytial virus infection (adjusted odds ratio, 9.41; 95% confidence interval, 2.13-41.57), lower oxygen saturation (2.00; 1.64-2.43), and age younger than 3 months (1.25; 1.07-1.24).
Conclusion: AB-related return visits may be associated with age younger than 3 months, lower oxygen saturation, and respiratory syncytial virus infection.",국윤준,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108702457
Comparison of Respiratory Outcomes between Less Invasive Surfactant Administration and the Intubation- Surfactant-Extubation Technique in Premature Infants with Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"Purpose: To compare respiratory outcomes between less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) and the intubation-surfactant-extubation (INSURE) technique in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).
Methods: We performed a retrospective medical chart review for 75 premature infants who were born at a gestational age (GA) of ≤34 weeks (between January 2017 and December 2019) and developed RDS after birth. Data on the demographic and outcome variables, including respiratory outcomes, were collected and compared between the infants who received LISA and those who received INSURE as a rescue therapy for RDS.
Results: No signifcant differences in GA, birth weight, and other demographic characteristics were found between the LISA and INSURE groups (GA: 28.7 weeks vs.
28.8 weeks, P=0.449; birth weight: 1,236 g vs. 1,124 g, P=0.714). At the delivery room, although the infants showed no significant difference in positive pressure ventilation rate after birth, the LISA group showed a higher rate of continuous positive airway pressure application than the INSURE group. The infants in the LISA group presented a higher risk of requiring multiple doses of surfactant for RDS than the infants in the INSURE group (57% vs. 17.5%, P=0.001). However, the duration of invasive and/ or noninvasive respiratory support and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia showed no signifciant difference between the two groups.
Conclusion: In the present study, no significant differences in the incidence of inhospital respiratory outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia were found between the LISA and INSURE groups. These results suggest that LISA can be an alternative therapeutic option for treating RDS to avoid intubation and mechanical ventilation in premature infants.",Hyeseon Kim,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108463191
신생아에서의 인플루엔자와 COVID-19 혼합감염의 증례,"Coinfection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with other respiratory pathogens may complicate diagnosis and treatment. Since the risk of coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase during the influenza epidemic period, it is necessary to study the clinical course of coinfection. To our knowledge, there have been a few cases of coinfection between SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus in neonates. Here, we report the clinical course of a neonate who was coinfected with the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2. A 20-day-old boy born with low birth weight presented with a fever. The patient was confirmed as positive with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and influenza B by real-time polymerase chain reaction at admission, whereas his mother was only COVID-19 positive at that time. Initial chest x-ray revealed hyperinflation and increased peribronchial markings at the right lower lung bronchus, but slightly decreased lung sounds without crackle or wheezing at admission. We administered empirical antibiotics for neonatal sepsis and oseltamivir for influenza B. On the chest x-ray follow-up, the findings showed improvement. After discharge, the patient showed a stable general condition. Children ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination who are coinfected with SARS-CoV-2 and the influenza virus are more likely to develop severe symptoms.

We evaluated the clinical characteristics according to RSV subgroup in infantile bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Methods: This study enrolled infants with bronchiolitis or pneumonia infected by single virus. Virus infection was confirmed by respiratory virus reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in two consecutive seasons (2010.2011, 2011.2012). They were divided into 3 groups: group 1 with RSV A, group 2 with RSV B, and group 3 with other virus. We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts to collect data on the hospitalized patients. Results: Seventy four and 181 infants were included in the two seasons, respectively. The most common virus was RSV B in 2010. 2011 and RSV A in 2011.2012. Among 255 infants, 55% (141/255) were group 1, 20% (49/255) group 2, 25% (65/255) group 3. Infants younger than 3 months were 55%. There were no significant age differences between groups. In comparison to group 3, group 1 and 2 showed frequent abnormal chest auscultation, high symptom severity score and need for systemic corticosteroid (P<0.05). In comparison to group 1 and 3, group 2 had longer hospitalization and time to need for normalization of lung sound (P<0.05). The recurrence rates within 6 months showed no significant differences between groups. Conclusion: The RSV subgroup changed from one year to another.

급성세기관지염과 혈청 비타민 D와의 상관관계,"Purpose: Vitamin D plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism. It is associated with various diseases such as cardiovascular, immune, allergic and infectious disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the difference in clinical manifestations according to the concentration of vitamin D in mild bronchiolitis.
Methods: We performed a retrospective review of medical records of patients with mild bronchiolitis from November 2016 to April 2017 in Daegu Fatima Hospital. Mild bronchiolitis was classified by the modified Tal’s score method. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 ng/mL. We analyzed the clinical characteristics and laboratory data from the 2 groups.
Results: Of the 64 patients, 19 were included in the deficiency group and 45 in the normal group. Vitamin D levels were 11.7±4.9 ng/mL in the deficiency group and 28.8±5.0 ng/mL in the normal group. There were no differences in clinical features between both groups. However, the vitamin D deficiency group had significantly longer hospitalization than the normal group (6.78±2.74 days vs. 5.3±1.7 days, P=0.045). In the deficiency group, the incidence of previous respiratory diseases was significantly higher (P=0.001). No significant difference in blood and respiratory virus tests was observed.

소아 급성 화농성 골수염의 임상적 고찰,"Purpose : Acute pyogenic osteomyelitis is uncommon in children. Delayed diagnosis and inappropriate treatment are leading to growth failure and deformation. We review the clinical manifestations and treatment of acute osteomyelitis in children according to age.
Methods : A retrospective analysis was made of 32 patients who underwent antibiotic management or operation between Aug 1989 and Dec 2003 for acute pyogenic osteomyelitis in age from 0 to 15 years old.
Results : The study group was composed of 21 boys and 11 girls. The subjects were divided into four groups according to age : 0-1 yr(n=6), 1-5 yr(n=11), 6-10 yr(n=8), and 11-15 yr(n=7). Nineteen cases were diagnosed in Winter. Femur was the most common infected site(37.5%). There were no predisposing factor in 17 patients, and 7 of 15 patients had trauma history. Sepsis was important predisposing factor in neonates. The chief complaints were pain, swelling and fever. S. aureus(61%) is the most common organism. Twenty-nine patients were treated with operation and concomitant antibiotics. Two cases had sequelae in follow-up period : One is avascular necrosis of femur and the other is discrepancy of leg length.
Conclusion : In our review, because of poor prognosis in septic neonates, we recommend to treat actively neonatal sepsis and prevent or detect osteomyelitis early. Because most of patients were diagnosed and treated in orthopedic surgery, the rate of operation was too high. So, protocol for further evaluation and management of acute osteomyelitis in pediatric patients were needed.",박지숙,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108204565
신생아 저산소성 허혈성 뇌손상에서 신경줄기세포의 치료적 적용,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) are characterized by a capacity for self-renewal, differentiation into multiple neural cell lineages, and migration toward damaged sites in the central nervous system (CNS). NSCs expanded in culture could be implanted into the brain where they integrate into host neural circuitry and stably express foreign genes. It hence appears that transplantation of NSCs has been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy in neurological disorders. During hypoxic-ischemic (HI)brain injury, factors are transiently elaborated to which NSCs respond by migrating to degenerating regions and differentiating towards replacement of dying neural cells. In addition, NSCs serve as vehicles for gene delivery and appear capable of simultaneous neural cell replacement and gene therapy (e.g. with factors that might enhance neuronal differentiation, neurites outgrowth, proper connectivity,neuroprotection, and/or immunomodulatory substances). When combined with certain synthetic biomaterials, NSCs may be even more effective in ‘engineering’the damaged CNS towards reconstitution. Human NSCs were isolated from the forebrain of an aborted fetus at 13 weeks of gestation and were grown as neurospheres in cultures. After the characterization of human NSCs in preclinical testing and the approval of the IRB, a clinical trial of the transplantation of human NSCs into patients with severe perinatal HI brain injury has been performed. The existing data from these clinical trials have shown to be safe, well tolerated, and of neurologicallysome benefits.

성염색체이상증후군의 핵형 분석,"Purpose : This study was performed to evaluate the recent frequency of karyotypes in different sex chromosome abnormalities and to evaluate the age and clinical manifestations at diagnosis.
Methods : Peripheral blood leukocytes were obtained from subjects who were clinically suspected to have sex chromosome abnormalities and referred to the cytogenetic laboratory in the Department of Pediatrics, Kyungpook National University Hospital from February 1981 to August 2001.
Results : The relative frequencies of different sex chromosome abnormalities were Klinefelter(52 percent), Turner(42 percent), XXX syndrome(3 percent) and mixed gonadal dysgenesis(3 percent). The populations of different karyotypes in Klinefelter syndrome were 47,XXY(97 percent) and 46,XY/ 47,XYY(3 percent). The populations of different karyotypes in Turner syndrome were 45,X(67 percent,), mosaicism(23 percent), and structural aberrations(10 percent). The populations of different karyotypes in XXX syndrome were 47,XXX(67 percent,) and 46,XX/47,XXX(33 percent). All mixed gonadal dysgenesis were 45,X/46,XY. Eighty one percent of sex chromosome abnormalities was diagnosed after puberty. Patients diagnosed with Klinefelter and Turner syndrome in infancy showed nearly normal phenotypes or had minor congenital malformations.
Conclusion : Early diagnoses of sex chromosome abnormalities is required to prevent associated morbidities and to maximize growth and development.

선행한 하기도감염 없이 발생한 폐쇄세기관지염의 임상 양상,"Purpose: We investigated young children who developed bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) without preceding severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI).
Methods: Twenty patients referred for chronic respiratory symptoms and diagnosed with BO were enrolled and divided into 2 age groups: group 1 (<2 years, n=12) and group 2 (≥2, <6 years, n=8). A diagnosis of BO was made based on clinical and radiologic findings: (1) persistent cough or abnormal breath sounds which were not responsive to any treatment for more than 6 weeks; and (2) mosaic perfusion on high-resolution computed tomography. None of the subjects had experienced LRTI since birth, and those who had any underlying problems were excluded. The clinical characteristics and disease course were examined retrospectively.
Results: Mean age of the patients was 6.8 months and 3.4 years in group 1 and 2, respectively. All patients presented with chronic cough and the most common type of cough was mixed (wet and dry), 67% in group 1 and 50% in group 2. Persistent stridor was the major respiratory sign in group 1 (67%), but 63% of group 2 patients showed no abnormal breath sounds. Chest x-ray finding was nonspecific in 75% each of both groups. The respiratory symptoms and signs resolved rapidly in most patients treated with pulse corticosteroid therapy. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second were observed in 3 of group 2 children at age 6, during the follow-up.
Conclusion: Our study shows that BO could develop without preceding severe LRTI. It also suggests that BO should be considered in the infants with persistent stridor accompanied by chronic cough.

"알레르기질환과 혈청 총 IgE 농도, 혈청 특이 IgE 농도, 말초혈액 총 호산구 수와의 관계","Purpose: Elevated IgE, and blood eosinophil count are considered the hallmarks of allergic diseases, while the levels of those parameters are shared with normal population. This study is aimed to investigate the relationship between those factor and clinical value according to specific allergic diseases. Methods: We reviewed medical records of 946 patients with allergic diseases who had taken the allergy tests from 2001 to 2010. The effects of age, sex, specific diagnoses of diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic rhinitis (AR), bronchial asthma (BA), urticarial on allergy tests were assessed. Results: In contrast to those of total eosinophil counts, there was the trend of increasing IgE value with the age in children with allergic diseases. The titer of total IgE and eosinophil count were higher than those of control group of patients with acute urticaria. There was the positive relation between total IgE and eosinophil count in patients with allergic diseases. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value of total IgE for specific IgE were higher than those of total eoshinophil count. Conclusion: There were the positive relation of total IgE and total eosinophil count in allergic diseases and the higher value of those compared with the control in this study.

This study investigated the clinical characteristics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) and the risk factors of refractory MPP (RMPP) by age.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 353 children admitted due to MPP from January 2015 to December 2016. Demographics, clinical information, laboratory data and radiological findings were collected from all patients in this study. The patients were divided into 2 groups by the age of 6 years. Also, both preschool (< 6 years old) and school-age (≥6 years old) children were divided into RMPP and non-RMPP patients.
Results: Total febrile days, febrile days before admission and the duration of macrolide antibiotic therapy were significantly longer in school-age children than in preschool children. School-age children had significantly greater risk of lobar consolidation (P=0.036), pleural effusion (P=0.001) and extrapulmonary complications (P=0.019). Necrotizing pneumonia and bronchiolitis obliterans tended to occur more frequently in preschool children than in school-age children. In both preschool and school-age children, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were significantly higher in RMPP patients than in non-RMPP patients. In preschool children, LDH >722 IU/L (odds ratio [OR], 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.44-6.50) and ferritin >177 ng/mL (OR, 5.38; 95% CI, 1.61-19.49) were significant risk factors for RMPP, while LDH >645 IU/L (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 1.64-10.97) and ferritin >166 ng/mL (OR, 5.51; 95% CI, 1.59-22.32) were so in school-age children.

조산아 기관지폐이형성증의 발생에서 호산구 활성화 표지자,"Purpose: Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is not the only a marker for eosinophil activation, but also acts as an alarm protein. Very few studies have examined the potential role of eosinophils in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This study aims to address the roles of eosinophil and EDN in the early phase of BPD development.
Methods: Patients were preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) born at 36 weeks of gestation or less. Blood and urine samples were collected to measure total eosinophil count in the blood, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), serum EDN, and urinary EDN during the first week of life.
Results: Fifty-two preterms were recruited, of whom 43 infants were analyzed. Comparisons were made between the RDS (n=16) and non-RDS groups (n=27) and between the BPD (n=6) and non-BPD groups (n=26). There were no differences between RDS and non-RDS group in total eosinophil count, serum ECP, serum EDN, or urinary EDN, except when compared by gestational age, birth weight and prenatal dexamethasone use. Urinary EDN was increased significantly in the BPD group compared to the non-BPD group.
Conclusion: We demonstrated the roles of eosinophil and EDN in the development of BPD and suggest that urinary EDN may be utilized as a noninvasive factor predicting the development of BPD. (Allergy Asthma Respir Dis 2022;10:40-44)",최선희 ( Sun-hee Choi ),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99884160
성선자극호르몬단독결핍성 성선기능저하증 환자의 분자유전학적 분석과 내분비기능에 관한 연구,"Purpose : Isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a disorder of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis causing gonadotrophin releasing hormone or gonadotrophin deficiency. Kallman syndrome has a constellation of features, characterized by HH, hyposomia, deafness and congenital heart defects, whereas a normal sense of smell indicates idiopathic HH. Defects in some genes such as KAL-1, FGFR1, GNRHR and GPR54, have been described. The study was undertaken to identify the molecular defects of aforementioned genes and to evaluate clinical profiles in patients with HH.
Methods : Among the patients who visited the hospital due to delayed puberty from March 1995 to March 2006, seven male patients were suspected of having HH and included in this study. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis and endocrinological data including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist stimulation test were investigated. For molecular genetic evaluation, routine karyotyping in all patients and mutation analyses of the KAL, FGFR-1, GNRHR and GPR54 genes in six patients were performed.
Results : The study included 7 patients diagnosed as HH by GnRH stimulation; 4 with Kallman syndrome and 3 with idiopathic HH. No mutation was identified by DNA sequence analysis of KAL-1, FGFR1, GNRHR and GPR54 genes in 7 patients with HH. At diagnosis, chronologic age was 16.88±1.90 years; height SDS, -0.36±1.43; mean volume of the testis, 1.79±0.76 mL. Of the patients with Kallman syndrome, 3 had sensory neural hearing loss, 2 congenital heart disease and 1 bilateral cryptorchidism. The olfactory bulb or sulci hypoplasia was found in all Kallman syndrome patients on the brain MRI. No abnormal finding was found in the brain MRI of the patients with idiopathic HH. Peak LH and FSH levels were 1.27±0.60 IU/L and 1.15±0.65 IU/L after GnRH stimulation. Baseline total testosterone level was 0.41±0.24 ng/mL. The patients were treated with testosterone enanthate every 3-4 weeks for the mean duration of 40.60±48.61 months. During the follow-up period, 5 patients reached the final adult height with the mean height of 175.00±6.47 cm (0.28±1.14 SDS).
Conclusion : For differential diagnosis of delayed puberty, physical, radiological, hormonal evaluations are all necessary. Many genes associated with Isolated HH were founded until now. But, mutations in these genes account for small proportion of Isolated HH yet. Further study of genes that regulate secondary sexual development and function will give important information regarding the development of normal puberty in humans.",유한욱,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108463189

Several case reports have demonstrated extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as an alternative treatment method for patients with status asthmaticus that failed to respond to maximal conventional therapy. We experienced a case of pregnant woman with severe asthma attack not relieved by conventional treatment, in whom early administration of ECMO resulted in a good outcome. A 23-year-old woman at, 11 weeks of pregnancy, was admitted with acute asthma attack. Despite maximal rescue therapies with mechanical ventilation, her condition gradually deteriorated. Venovenous ECMO was initiated 4 hours from intubation and gas exchange with lung mechanics was rapidly recovered within hours. She was extubated 45 hours after initiation of ECMO and had successful weaning from ECMO 2 days after extubation. The patient had no complication and gave birth to a healthy baby at 37 weeks of gestation. This is the first case report in Korea on the successful use of ECMO in a pregnant woman with severe respiratory insufficiency due to status asthmaticus, who failed to respond to mechanical ventilation and maximum pharmacological treatment.

코로나바이러스감염증-19 범유행과 연관된 응급실 방문의 변화,"Purpose: This study was performed to investigate the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related changes in visiting pattern of an emergency department (ED).
Methods: The author investigated all children younger than 19 years who visited the ED from 2018 through 2020 without exclusion criteria. Pandemic period was defined as 2020. Variables of interest were monthly and annual numbers of visits, age and age groups (< 1, 1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-18 years), sex, visits for diseases, disposition, high acuity, and top 5 chief complaints per each age group. Timing of social distancing and influenza-related visits were additionally analyzed to speculate the impact of such variables on the visiting patterns.
Results: The annual visits were 11,435 (2018), 10,741 (2019), and 5,626 (2020), with a 47.6%-50.8% pandemic-related decrease. Trauma-related visits increased from 27.7%-28.4% to 36.5% (P < 0.001). In the children aged 9 years or younger, trauma as a chief complaint increased from 22.2%-29.6% to 36.2%-42.5% while fever decreased from 27.7%-47.3% to 16.7%-42.6%. In the pre-pandemic period, visits increased in February-March and October-December with a sharp increase in influenza-related visits in the latter 3 months. During the pandemic, a sharp decline in the visits was noted in January- February without the above-mentioned increasing patterns in neither total nor influenza-related visits. After the social distancing was implemented in the 13th week of 2020, the visits remained steady until a slight increase was noted after the school opening.
Conclusion: During the pandemic period, a decrease was noted in the numbers of visits to the ED, along with decreases in fever as a chief complaint in young children and influenza-related visits, and the mitigation of social distancing.

한국 소아 식품알레르기의 연구 현황과 과제,"Food allergy is an immune-mediated adverse reaction that occurs mainly by consumption of food. Some of the children with food allergies have mild symptoms like urticaria and pruritus, while others manifest fatal symptoms like anaphylaxis. Many cases develop in infants and children, and disappear spontaneously over time. The prevalence of food allergy is known to be up to 6% of children and 3%-4% of adults. Growing concern is that prevalence of food allergy seems to be increasing. The prevalence, common allergens and natural course of food allergy vary according to the race, age, eating habits, and unknown factors. In Korea, many researchers have reported regional data on food allergy for comparison with those of foreign countries. Awareness is increasing and food labelling is being established to help people avoid allergenic foods. In the future, monitoring of prevalence and common food allergens at regular intervals is needed to make appropriate policies for children with food allergy. There are still lack of data on pathogenesis, natural course and clinical trials of immunotherapy in Korean children. In addition, it is necessary to form a consensus on primary prevention of food allergy by early exposure to allergenic foods. Further regional studies should be performed to expand our understanding of food allergy and to lead to proper management for Korean children with food allergy.

신생아 중환자실에서 Serratia marcescens에 의한 집단 감염 발생에 대한 고찰,"Purpose : We evaluated an outbreak of Serratia marcescens infections in 24 neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit(NICU).
Methods : From January to August, 2004 a nosocomial outbreak of S. marcescens occurred in our NICU. We describe the clinical characteristics of the outbreak and analyse the risk factors for infections with S. marcescens. After the outbreak stopped, 7 isolates from blood were typed using rapid amplified polymorphic DNA analysis(RAPD).
Results : S. marcescens was isolated from 24 neonates, 19 infected and 5 colonized. Seven out of nineteen neonates had bacteremia, 4 had ventilator associated pneumonia, 4 had purulent conjunctivitis, 2 had UTI, 1 had meningitis and 1 had a wound infection. Three neonates died due to S. marcescens infection, 2 of 3 had ventilator associated pneumonia, 1 had meningitis complicated with abscess. The mortality rate of S. marcescens infection was 15.8%. Factors associated with S. marcescens infections were previous antibiotic therapy, indwelling catheter and use of ventilators. The isolated strains were resistant to most antibiotics, but frequently sensitive to imipenem, bactrim and amikacin. RAPD typing results show that at least 3 epidemic strains were related with this outbreak. But one genotype was predominant type in this outbreak. The control measures were instituted and the outbreak stopped within 2 months.
Conclusion : S. marcescens can cause rapidly spreading outbreaks associated with fatal infections in neonates. If S. marcescens is isolated from clinical specimens, meticulous infection control measures and epidemiologic investigations should be done at an early stage of the outbreak.",성민정,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104549090
아침식사와 청소년 건강,"Breakfast is an important meal for adolescents to supply adequate nutrition for growth and maintenance and to prevent chronic disease. Nevertheless, the rate of skipping breakfast, which decreased 6 years ago, has gradually increased again in recent years in Korea. Manystudies show that skipping breakfast increases the risk for obesity, amenorrhea, and poor academic performance. The recommended breakfast for adolescents is a low glycemic load (GL) diet, fiber-rich family breakfast. The hunger and lazy feeling after breakfast are enhanced by a high GL and low fiber diet, which leads to additional intake of calories. A family breakfast can help to maintain a healthy life-style and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease.

신생아 환기의 새로운 양식들,"Many premature infants require mechanical ventilatory support and oxygen supply. Because they have immature lungs, these ventilator supports contribute to the development of ventilator induced lung injury, which causes the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in large portion. Recent meta-analysis reported that the volume-targeted ventilation reduced the development of BPD and death. Non-invasive ventilator support also can reduce the adverse effects associated with intubation and mechanical ventilatory support. The technological advancements, including microprocessors, enhance the development of new devices with new modes of ventilatory support. A lot of limits and demerits of conventional ventilatory support obviously inspired the thoughts of new modes of ventilatory support. In this article, new modes of ventilatory support for neonates, as well as conventional modes,are introduced in the hope of adopting strategies with evidences efficiently.",손동우,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101598987
입원한 소아의 마이코플라스마 폐렴에서 치료 행태 분석: 다기관 후향적 연구,"Purpose: Macrolide-refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MP) has markedly increased since 2003 and corticosteroids or second-line antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones or tetracyclines, was considered an alternative treatment modality in macrolide-refractory MP. We aimed to show the real-world treatment pattern of MP in hospitalized children and compared clinical and laboratory findings between children with and without steroid treatment.
Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 384 children diagnosed with MP from 6 hospitals in Korea from August 2015 to March 2016. We investigated the clinical, laboratory and radiologic findings, and medications used for the treatment of the subjects.
Results: The corticosteroids and second-line antibiotics were administered in 55.5% and 7.0%, respectively. The percentages of steroid administration varied from 17% to 69% in each hospital. The mean start date of corticosteroid administration was 3.4 hospital days. Patients with corticosteroid treatment had a longer length of hospital stay than those without corticosteroid. They exhibited higher rates of lobar pneumonia and pleural effusion, and required longer days until improvement in chest X-ray findings. They also had higher rates of allergic diseases and showed higher C-reactive protein levels at admission.
Conclusion: In the real-world practice studied in the 6 hospitals, corticosteroids were more frequently administered than second-line antibiotics to hospitalized children with MP. Children with corticosteroid adjuvant therapy had more severe pneumonia than those without. Randomized controlled trials are needed to make appropriate guidelines for macrolide-refractory MP.",이영주,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100299063
소아청소년에서 흡연 노출과 알레르기비염,"The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in children and adolescents is constantly increasing. However, few studies exist on the relationship between smoking and allergic rhinitis. In addition to conventional cigarettes, electronic and heated cigarettes have recently been introduced, which have several harmful effects. It is hypothesized that smoking and rhinitis are correlated; however, this relationship is complex. Previous studies reported that exposure to smoking during pregnancy is associated with allergic rhinitis development. Unlike the varied results reported in adults, studies on children and adolescents have often correlated direct/indirect smoke with allergic rhinitis, with prolonged exposure being associated with a higher risk of allergic rhinitis, particularly when exposed at an early age. Nonallergic inflammatory reactions and immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic sensitization are assumed to be the underlying mechanisms for the association between allergic rhinitis and smoking. Measures to reduce smoking are warranted to lower the incidence of allergic rhinitis in children and adolescents and to improve their health.",최봉석,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101971571
집먼지진드기로 유발한 알레르기비염 면역치료 모델의 개발,"Purpose: Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only known curative treatment for allergic diseases. Recently, novel immunotherapies have been developed to overcome the inconvenience and adverse reactions associated with conventional AIT. Validated animal models are essential for screening novel immunotherapies; however, effective models for AIT in allergic rhinitis (AR) are lacking. Herein, we aimed to develop an optimal protocol for AIT using a house dust mite (HDM)-induced AR mouse model.
Methods: BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with the alum-absorbed HDM extract (5 μg) on days 0, 7, and 14. Sensitized mice were administered three subcutaneous injections of HDM extract (250 μg/100 μL; SCIT group) and phosphate-buffered saline (100 μL; negative and positive control groups) at 2-day intervals. Next, HDM extract (25 μg) was intranasally administered to SCIT and positive control groups for five consecutive days. Nasal symptoms, ear swelling, eosinophil count, antibody levels, and nasal mucosa histopathology were assessed in all groups. Cytokine production was analyzed in the splenocyte culture supernatant.
Results: Compared with the positive control group, the SCIT group exhibited reduced nasal symptoms, ear swelling, and eosinophil count in nasopharyngeal lavage. Compared with the positive control group, the SCIT group had reduced eosinophil, mast cell, and goblet cell counts in the nasal mucosa. Serum levels of HDM-specific IgG1 were higher in the SCIT group than in the positive control group. The stimulation index of splenocytes was reduced in the SCIT group when compared with that in the positive control group. Compared with the positive control group, the SCIT group exhibited decreased levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17, whereas those of IL-10 and interferon-gamma levels were increased.
Conclusion: AR mice treated with the AIT-HDM protocol showed attenuated nasal symptoms and improved histopathological findings and cytokine profiles compared with the untreated AR mice. Our findings suggest that the examined model may be useful for screening new AITs.",김석민,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101598994
태변흡입증후군 생존 환아에서 발생하는 하기도질환의 양상 및 위험 인자,"Purpose: Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) occurs when aspiration of meconium itself or meconium-stained amniotic fluid enters into the airways. The relationship between MAS and how they affect the respiratory outcome after recovery from MAS remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the type of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in those surviving MAS survivors and to find out whether any clinical findings or treatment determine the type of LRTI.
Methods: We used the Catholic Medical Center’s clinical data warehouse to review data from 4 university hospitals. We first included 1,331 newborns born between March 2016 and February 2021 with diagnostic codes including labor and delivery complicated by fetal stress (distress), intrauterine hypoxia, and neonatal aspiration syndromes. We finally included 239 patients who visited the out-patient clinic with diagnosis of pneumonia, acute bronchitis, acute bronchiolitis, and asthma, according to the Korean Standard Classification of Diseases.
Results: We observed a significantly higher number and fraction of eosinophils at birth in the bronchitis group. We also found significantly lower levels of white blood cells in the asthma group. After a regression analysis, we found that mechanical ventilation and steroid usage for treatment for of MAS was significantly related to bronchitis, and that antibiotics treatment acted as a protective factor for bronchiolitis.
Conclusion: Laboratory findings and treatment at birth in infants with MAS appear to have impact on determining LRTI in those who survived MAS.",김광희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101971617
