In the legal regulation of euthanasia, the doctor's duty to keep life should be weighed against the patient's rights of self-determination or keeping human dignity. It is generally accepted that the doctor's duty takes precedence of the patient's rights in case of the positive euthanasia. As regards the indirect euthanasia, the doctor's duty and the patient's rights are valued equally. However, in the matter of the negative euthanasia, the patient's rights are more important than the doctor's duty.

Ⅱ. The structure of legitimating euthanasia
The extend of the doctor's duty to keep life in the cases is judged by the juduciary. But, in case of euthanasia, there can be no substantial standard giving priority to certain rights and the judge can not be the appropriate subject of decision.

Ⅲ. The procedural legitimation of euthanasia
To perform legal euthanasia, the doctor should
① record the case history of patient and verify his/her incurability and severe pain,
② be demanded euthanasia continuously by the patient who accept euthanasia of his/her own free will,
③ discuss with the patient's family or religionist,
④ discuss with other doctors about performing euthanasia,
⑤ keep records of the euthanasia process.
If these requisites are fulfilled, the right of final decision on euthanasia should be given to doctor. And the doctor has also the obligation of keeping the euthanasia procedure which is controlled by the criminal sanctions.",이상돈,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2059983
보조생식술의 현황과 문제점,"The Assisted Reproductive Technologies(ARTs) have been developed and applied over a relatively short span of time since 1978. Many variants on the basic in vitro fertilization methodology have been introduced. ARTs include in vitro fertilization(IVF), gamate intra fallopian transfer (GIFT), use donor occytes, and cryopreserved embryo transfer. And recently intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has proven most effective for the treatment of severe male-factor infertility and of previous fertilization failure.
ARTs are prominent in ethical arguments of this century. Such ethical arguments involve public inquiries, ethical committees, religious pressure, legal decision in courts.

인공 장기의 현황 - 장기이식의 대치 가능성에 대하여,"The human body is essentially an advanced machine that is composed of many parts. Like any typical machine, the parts can become fatigued and fail or quit functioning due to overuse or misuse. When the parts of the human body become dysfunctional, they need to either be repaired or replaced. This creates a large demand for transplants. Unfortunately this demand greatly exceeds the availability of these organs. This shortage of human organs for transplantation poses engineers with the problem of creating other devices to substitute for the needed organ. Current breakthroughs in mechanical assist devices are buying patients additional time. Long-term total artificial hearts are now under development and scheduled for trials early in the next century. The technology allows us to safely use mechanical ventilators, today, and also take a step towards a reliable and safe artificial lung. For those whos suffer from ""low vioion"", the first prosthetic devices using electronic implants and computer signal processing will emerge in the years 2010-2020. The wearable artificial kidneys are under development and there are several new advances for treating liver disease with artificial cell.

So it follows the model of ""Abortion an Cause."", These indications are genetic indications, ethical indications, and medical indications. But there is not social indications in that Act. And the Act enacts that abortion must be operated by doctors until 28 weeks after pregnancy. I think that the Korean legal system that regulates abortion is not good.

현장보전과 사진촬영의 실무적 고찰,"scene preservaton and taking a picture on case studies
""Just imagine a murder scene.""
A police, a medical examiner and a court of justice all show different type of interests on their needs. A court of justice only cares about collecting evidence by preservation of the scene for the institution and support of a public action. The medical examiner also focuses on scene preservation in order to determine the cause of death. However, the police are pressured on arresting a criminal and perfect scene preservation at the same time. A crime is committed faster, intellectual and being specialized over a wider area these days. Further, criminals even try to delude the police by faking an actual spot ingeniously rather by just damaging or demolishing it.
A little delay of police's action will make hard to find a criminal. Even if a criminal is arrested, it is still hard to find physical or human evidence, which results in necessary change in basic investigation process for the time being. The change should cover organization structure and HR management to catch up with ever-changing crime trend.
As a crime occurs, most of police investigation proceeds in following order; scene preservation, on-the-spot inspection, scene investigation, criminal investigation, criminal arrest, on-site verification, forwarding to the prosecution. Among them, spot investigation is most essential and primal part. However, as stated before, the police overemphasize a criminal arrest, which makes 100% perfectly preserved scene almost impossible by overlooking its importance. Anybody related to crime scene, a victim, the bereaved, 119 firemen or first arrived officer, can be blamed for a scene preservation failure. But it's deplorable to say that the police are the one who damage a crime scene under the name of priority on rapid criminal arrest. They hardly care for securing evidence according to proper procedure. The problem caused by a primal scene preservation failure is not counted at all. The only concern they have is how rapidly they arrest a criminal.
In the end, we need to come up with a systematic process that experts can gather evidence at perfectly preserved spot. Furthermore, we can get job done great by an effective communication between different parties; i.e. a police, a medical examiner and a court of justice.
Hereby, this dissertation will discuss the right ways to preserve a crime scene through related case studies, along with general introduction of current scene preservation tools and taking pictures of spot.",윤외출,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3001123

The incidence of gunshot injuries are extremely low in this country, and there have been only few studies, related to the patterns of gunshot injury.
We performed an experimental study using porcine skin and five kinds of guns to document the objective characteristics of entrance according to the range of fire.
The results were ;
1. The entrances of M16A1 rifle and K-2 rifle showed characteristic six and three directional blackening in radial fashion due to muzzle breaks in the cases of contact and close-contact gunshot, respectively. These radiation blackening disappeared at 5cm range.
2. The blackening of gunshot by rifles markedly decreased in the range of 15 to 20cm and no blackening was observed in the 50cm range in the cases of K-2 rifle. In the 100cm range gunshot, only bullet effects were observed in both M16A1 and K-2 rifles. When cloths were applied over porcine skin, the blackening disappeared at 20cm range.

독물 감저의 현황과 문제점,"During 1991, the number of cases requested and examined at the National Institute of Scientific Investigation were 16840. These examinations involved the identification of a wide variety of chemicals in biological fluids and physical evidences. In order to investigate the trend in the use of poisons, the regional monthly distribution of toxic compounds were statistically surveyed.
As a result, the following findings were found ;
1. Toxic compounds in 16840 cases were classified into eighteen categories : Therapeutic drugs(839), Tranquillisers(24), Methamphetamines(743), anaesthetics(10), Narcotics(193), Marihuana(739), Hallucinogenic substances(1692), Carbon monoxide(540), Herb medicine(63), Adulterated food(264), toxin(5), Cyanide(166), heavy metals(83), Blood alcohol(5043), Acid and alkali(38), rodenticides(19), Pesticides(313) and others.
2. Monthly distribution of poisons didn't show a significant difference, however May and October revealed slightly more cases than Jan., Feb., Jul. and Aug.
3. Regional distribution of poisons revealed that Seoul was the highest with the 9020 cases(53.6%) followed by Busan and Kyungnam were 2494(14.8%) and Daeku and Kyung buk were 1165(9.61).
4. There was marked increase in the number of fatalities from drug abuse in 1991. Fatal concentration of drugs were determined in more than 20 post-mortem bloods. Methamphetamine, zipeprol, dextromethorphan and doxylamines are among them.

생물학적 증거물의 채취,"As physical evidence can prove that a crime has been committed or establish key elements of a crime, police investigators deal with evidence on a daily basis. When its collection is performed with a selectivity governed by the collector's thorough knowledge of the crime laboratory's techniques, capabilities, and limitations, physical evidence can only achieve its optimum balue in criminal investigations. Also, their ability to recognize, collect, and use evidence effectively in criminal investigations determines to a large degree their success as the crime investigators. If the investigator cannot recognize physical evidence or cannot preserve it for laboratory examination, no mount of sophisticated laboratory instrumentation or technical expertise can salvage the situation.
The know-how for conducting a proper crime-scene search for physical evidence is not beyond the grasp of any police department and forensic practitioners. With proper training, the techniques of crime-scene investigation including collection and preservation of physical evidence are not difficult to master and certainly lie within the bounds of comprehension of the average police officer.",황적준,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3001128

The victim died by placing the nozzle of an air blow gun, installed on an outdoor sports field, into her nose, and pulling the trigger. An autopsy ascribed her death to pneumothorax. Numerous accidents associated with air blow guns have been reported in the media. However, the use of an air blow gun has not been the subject of a suicide case study in forensic literature.

In these cases, there may be no external sign at all. Unfortunately the deep or lateral portion of neck is the area that is not routinely dissected at autopsy. This is probably why this syndrome was not recognized until a few years ago.

입원환자자살의 책임한계와 문제점,"Suicide rates are higher in the psychiatric patients than at any other hospitalized patient groups. Common factors of failures in suicide intervention/prevention during psychiatric hospitalization treatment are inadequate diagnostic psychiatric representation in overall treatment of patients and lack of objective standardized behavior assessment methods. Major lethal suicide behavior components observed from case studies include (1) erroneous diagnosis by primary and secondary care clinicians (2) inadequate or inappropriate selection of treatment methods (3) incompetent observation and supervision of admitted patient to prevent self-harm (4) superficial care and conflicting support given by nursing staffs (5) negligence of informed consent (6) lack of precautionary environment and surroundings (7) unlawful hospital admittance procedures (8) neglecting of moving hospital department for better care
Most of the case studies from Korea indicate that the judgments are against primary psychiatric clinicians for full responsibility of damage, negligence and wrong doings. In Japan, however, there are various decision and verdicts are made for or against the clinicians. There are very few cases where judgments are against clinicians to take responsibilities for the suicidal behavior. These decisions indicate greater recognition and acceptance of expert diagnostic and decision making authority given to primary psychiatric physicians. This is based on a belief and acceptance of court that establishing therapeutic relationship between patient and clinician is an essential factor in nursing care of suicidal patients. There still lacks firm legal frameworks for handling reported suicides from hospitalized psychiatric patients. Misconceptions about suicide, lack of appropriate suicide risk assessment, inadequate identification of standardized suicide risk factors and danger signs all attribute to the delay in any legal discussion or stipulation of legal foundation for handling suicide committed among admitted patients including contractual responsibility. Even when a contract can be completed between the participating parties, details of agreement are still remain in question, i.e., focus on intervention and prevention of suicide or facilitate reintroduction to the community.

친모의 유전자형을 알 수 없을 때 친자확인 유전자 검사,"In parentage testing DNA profiles are used to link the alleged father with paternity by matching their patterns. The probative value of a match is often calculated by multiplying together the estimated frequencies with which each particular VNTR or STR pattern occurs in a reference population. When this calculating method applies to the motherless case of paternity disputes, a calculation must usually be based on types determined for the child and the alleged father. In such case, the first consideration is to exclude a man from paternity of a child when the man did not have the child's paternal allele at some loci, or if the paternal allele cannot be determined, when the man had neither of the child's alleles. The second is to evaluate the DNA evidence when a man is not excluded by the paternal allele.
This work is to provide theories of paternity analysis with three approach methods for the motherless case, and to evaluate their efficiency compared to the trio case when the man tested is not excluded. Consequently, the motherless case offers lower probability exclusion and questionable cumulative paternity index than those of the trio case as being typed with 14 STR loci(CSF1PO, THO1, TPOX, vWA, nity index than those of the trio case as being typed with 14 STR loci(CSF1PO, THO1, TPOX, vWA, D5S818, D13S317, D7S820, D16S539, FGA, D21S11, FES/FPS, F13A1, D18S80, D17S5). Since the motherless case in paternity disputes is less efficient for paternity exclusion of the child, the use of genetic maker systems with the higher value of mean exclusion chance(MEC) and exact levels of the relative probability of paternity must be of importance considered in the analysis of such deficiency cases.",황적준,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2060272

The relationship between the biological parents was that of long- term partners in 12 cases (60%). The place of childbirth was the perpetrator’s home in 16 cases (80%). The place of abandonment wasoutdoors in 9 cases (5 cases alive, 4 cases dead) and indoors in 10 cases (5 cases alive, 5 cases dead). Basic life support for the infant was provided in 4 cases. The most common excuse for abandonment was to conceal childbirth in 12 cases, followed by economic hardship in 8 cases. Executions were suspended in 19 cases, and the reasons for the sentences often seemed inadequate, even in light of the provisions of the criminal code. These results indicate that our society has the need to develop the appropriate acts or policies to stop the crime of infant abandonment.",김윤신,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107929567
낭성 뇌동맥류의 파열과 연관된 전교통동맥의 드문 해부학적 변이,"Although most cerebral aneurysms are considered as acquired degenerative lesions, diverse anatomical variations in the circle of Willis have been encountered, some of which may play an important role in lesion hemodynamics and pathogenesis. The coalescence of the small vascular plexus to form the anterior communicating artery at the 6-7-week embryological stage may lead to developmental variations, such as fenestration and duplication. Herein, we report a rare anatomical variant of the anterior communicating artery that was concomitantly identified with a ruptured aneurysm. Both the right and left anterior cerebral arteries were connected by three anterior communicating arteries. A vertical segmental artery was present and connected the two anterior communicating arteries, forming an H-shape or plexiform structure.
Furthermore, a 0.6×0.4 cm-sized saccular aneurysm with antero-inferior projection was present in the middle anterior communicating artery. The combination of triplication and H-shape in the present case was compared to previously reported anatomical variants.",전요한,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739555

성도착(性倒錯),"Human sexual behavior is so diverse and its interrlations with almost every life so complex that a comprehensive understanding of it is extremely difficult. No delineation of what is normal in human sexual behavior may be designated pathological if the behavior is compulsive, exclusive, or accompanied by much anxiety and guilt.
Paraphilias, or sexual perversions, are characterized by specialized sexual fantasies and intense sexual urges and practices which are usually repetitive in nature and distressing to the person. The special fantasy, with its unconscious and conscious components, is the pathognomonic element, sexual arousal and orgasm being associated phenomena. The influence of the fantasy and its behavioral manifestations extend beyond the sexual sphere to pervade the person's life. Paraphilic arousal may be transient in some persons who act out their impulses only during periods of stress or conflict. The major categories of paraphilias include are pedophilia, exhibitionism, sexual sadism, sexual
masochism, voyerism, fetishism, trancvestism, frotteurism, and a separate category for other paraphilias, for example, zoophilia, and necrophilia.
However, the homosexuality is not a paraphilia but a sexual orientation distress. Now it is needed that the clinician recognize that the persons with an exclusive or predominant preference for same-sex sex partners are not considered to have a mental disorder on their sexual orientation alone.",이윤성,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2059926
법원 판결과 연명의료결정법으로 본 환자의 자기결정권과 죽음에 대한 고찰,"The South Korean Supreme Court decision (2009Da17471), May 21, 2009, on removing life-sustaining medical care from persistent vegetative patients gave consent to death with dignity and initiated a lively debate in South Korea. The legal grounds for this decision were based on dignity, worth, and the right to pursue happiness regulated in Article 10 of the Constitution, The Death with Dignity Act was legislated as a law for life-sustaining medical care through debate and agreement on February 3, 2016, and has since been revised four times. However, there are some issues to discuss with this Act. First, the definition of the process of dying is unclear because the determining point of the dying process is different from the status of the attachment or detachment of an artificial ventilator. Second, the purpose of this law is the protection of dignity, worth, and the right to pursue happiness. As nutrition, fluid, and oxygen must be continuously supplied, even if the artificial ventilator is removed, is it reasonable to suggest that supplying these continuously achieves Article 10 of the Constitution? Third, if the withdrawal of life-sustaining medical care is possible or permitted without the patient’s approval, what is the legal value of advance directives? Fourth, it is whether death with dignity could be extended to the euthanasia. Conclusively, it may be necessary to partially revise the law for life-sustaining medical care through further debate and agreement.",나주영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2059908

The Y-STR haplotype search function allows researchers to retrieve Y-STR haplotypes that meet queried Y-STR allele, Y-haplogroup affiliation, and/or sample information from a selected population in the open database, which consists of 12-17 Y-STR loci. The number of matches in a selected population, haplotype frequency estimator,and detailed results for matched and neighbor haplotypes are displayed as a set of search results. The kinship index calculation function provides kinship indices of 2input Y-STR haplotypes for the relationship represented by the number of meioses,with consideration of target population and mutation rate of each Y-STR. In addition,ySTRmanager allows registered users to configure their own database to store and analyze Y-STR haplotype and/or mutation rate data.

We retrieved two cases of neonatal deaths in the toilets and reviewed their autopsy findings and circumstances. However, findings from the postmortem examination were insignificant. Their lung examinations revealed non-expanded alveoli, and hydrostatic tests were negative. However, the cases cannot be confirmed as stillbirths because of the possibility that they might be alive for a short period of time after birth and then exposed into the water in the toilet or to accidental or non-accidental asphyxia or that they might have died because of neglect.

1.The total number of cases was 330, among which male took 256(77.5%) cases, female 74(22.5%) cases. The natural death took 134(40.6%) cases, unnatural death 177(53.6%) cases. For remaining 19(5.8%) cases the cause of death was known, although thorough analyses including microscopic examination, toxicology study were done. The thirties were most as 25.4% of the total cases and the forties followed the second.
2.The number of autopsy showed severe variation annually or monthly in a year.
3.Among unnatural death, death by violent injury took 87(49.2%) cases, asphyxia 48(27.1%) cases, intoxication 17(9.6%) cases and death by thermal injuries or electric injuries 25(14.1%) cases.
4.Among natural death the abnormality in cardiovascular system were the most as 73(54.5%) cases, gastrointestinal system 38(28.4%) cases and central nervous system 12(8.9%) cases.
5.There were some differences between these and the data from other institute in the ratio of male to female, ratio of natural death to unnatural death and the ratio of specific cause of death among natural and unnatural death.
6.During this work, there were some difficulties in the aspect the irregularity of the work, in requesting toxicology and in the expense needed for the process. Considering the educational aspect for the students and the residents in pathology, performing medicolegal autopsy in medical college should be encouraged.

Model evaluation criteria were, R 2 mean squared error (MSE), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The von Bertalanffy model yielded the highest R 2 value and the lowest MSE, AIC, and BIC values for C. lata , whereas the logistic model was the best fit for the data from the other three species C. vicina, Ch. pinguis , and L. illustris.",박지은,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2060305
아크릴 접착체(디클로로메탄)을 이용한 사망: 증례 보고,"Deaths due to dichloromethane (DCM) poisoning are mainly caused due to accidents at industrial sites, and suicidal cases are known to be rare. Herein, we report a case of a 56-year-old man who worked as a technician and died after consuming DCM for suicidal motive. According to the investigations, he had left a recorded message on his phone for his wife, which suggested he committed suicide. At the scene, opened DCM and whiskey bottles were found; approximately 120 mL of the DCM was still in the bottle. No specific injuries were externally observed during the autopsy. Microscopic examination showed denudation of epithelium in the esophageal and gastric mucosa, and no inflammatory reaction proceeded. The denudation was accompanied by pulmonary edema, acute tubular necrosis in the kidneys, and microvesicular steatosis in the liver. The DCM was detected in blood, gastric contents, and nasal cavity fluid. The concentration of alcohol in the blood was found to be 0.487%. It was presumed that he died of acute DCM poisoning while drunk. In cases of suspicious acute and chronic DCM poisoning deaths, investigations of carboxyhemoglobin and the clinical chemistry of blood or body fluids are warranted to determine the cause and mechanism of death.",현호봉,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2060230
"독일, 일본 및 한국의 학생 법의학 교육","Germany, Japan, and Korea have a similar medicolegal death investigation system, the so-called European style, governed by prosecutors for crime investigation and brought into Korea through Japan from Germany. In this system, all physicians must be engaged in postmortem external examination and issue a death certificate for unnatural death. Therefore, education in forensic medicine should be provided to medical students to ensure the ability to determine the cause of death and the manner of death after graduation. However, the quality of undergraduate education in forensic medicine is known to be unsatisfactory in Korea because there is no well-organized nation-based education policy. This study aims to review significant features of the education system for forensic medicine in Germany, Japan, and Korea. Related laws and regulations, standard curriculum, and incorporation of forensic medicine in medical license examination are comparatively analyzed. In conclusion, the Korean education system in forensic medicine has a weak structure for achieving competency in postmortem external examination, while Germany and Japan have sustained relatively concrete frameworks. Practical approaches are proposed for improving education quality, including incorporating forensic medicine into compulsory assessment in the medical licensing examination.",허기영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106885873
요도와 직장 내 이물 삽입에 의한 비전형적 자기색정 사망,"Autoerotic death is an accidental death during sexual pleasure, usually caused by a device or equipment used to enhance pleasure. Autoerotic deaths can be classified as typical or atypical. Typical autoerotic deaths occur due to asphyxiation by mechanical compression, while atypical autoerotic deaths occur by means other than asphyxiation. Narcissism-associated accidental deaths during tube and wire insertion into the urethra and rectum are extremely rare. The victim, a man in his 40s, was found dead at his home. Several tools for masturbation and wires for urethral and rectal insertion were observed around the victim and many pornographic videos were also identified. Family accounts and medical records indicated that he masturbated often by inserting plastic tubes and wires into the urethra and rectum. Moreover, the victim had a history of surgeries to remove foreign objects from the urethra and rectum as well as a history of psychiatric treatment. The autopsy results revealed no specific findings indicative of the cause of death. In conclusion, the investigators determined the cause of death as an atypical autoerotic death based on the death scene investigation, autoerotic sexual behavior, personal history, and autopsy results.",권오영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108379958
2016년부터 2020년까지 국내 법의부검률의 변화,"A medicolegal autopsy is usually performed to determine the cause and manner of death based on judicial or administrative directives applicable in cases of unusual deaths. Social interest in medicolegal autopsies is increasing in recent times. In this study, we investigated medicolegal autopsy rates in Korea and compared these with rates reported by other countries. We obtained data regarding autopsies performed between 2016 and 2020 from the relevant institutions. We calculated the autopsy rate using mortality data from Statistics Korea. The number of medicolegal autopsies performed increased from 8,382 in 2016 to 9,308 in 2020, with an annual increase in numbers. The medicolegal autopsy rate of total deaths increased from 2.98% in 2016 to 3.05% in 2020, and the medicolegal autopsy rates of unusual deaths increased from 12.45% to 13.12% during the same period. However, it repeated an increase and a decrease by year during the study period.

사람골수 세포에서 B 혈액형 항원의 출현에 대한 면역 전자현미경적 연구,"Membrane antigens are extensively studied on different mammalian cell lines.
Antigens of the erythrocyte series are often chemically well defined heterosaccharide determinants.
since Yunis and Yunis (1963) gave strong evidence of the presence of A,B and H alloantigens on human normoblasts by indirect agglutination methods, several workers have detected A antigens by immunoelectron microscopy using peroxidase labelled antibodies (Reyes et al.,1974), staphylococcal protein A technique (Karhi et al., 1981) and fluorescence activated cell sorter (Sieff et al., 1981, 1982).
Here we report immunoelectron microscopy observation of blood group B antigen on human normoblasts using peroxidase-labelled antibodies which allow detection of surface antigens on separated cells.
The bone marrow specimens were selected from the ones which had been depleted of erythrocytes by a Ficoll-Hypaque technique and stored in liquid nitrogen(-196℃) as described (Seung & Kim, 1985).
The selected specimens were from eight blood type B individuals with no disturbances in erythropoiesis.
These experiments were carried out with cytocentrifuge smears and cell suspensions for light microscopic and electron microscopic observations respectively.
The cell suspensions were fixed prior to incubation with reagents.
Fixation was achieved by resuspending the cell pellet in phospate-buffered saline solution of 1.25% glutaraldehyde for 30min: followed by washes with a large quantity of the same buffer.
They were resuspended in methanol containing 0.3% H₂O₂ for 30min. to block endogenous peroxidase and washed.
And they were labelled by an indirect method using human Anti-B(IgM) and rabbit antihuman IgM antibodies labelled with horseradish peroxidase.
The cytochemical detection of horseradish peroxidase was carried out by resuspending the cells for 30 min. in the dark in the usual medium containing diamino-benzidine and H₂O₂.
Subsequently specimens were washed, postfixed with 1% OsO₄ for 30 min. and processed for dehydration in alcohol and acetone.
For transmission electron microscopy they were embedded in Epon, sectioned and stained and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
The results were as follows:
1. Under a light microscope the smears showed that brown positive cells were mixed with negative cells, but the precise identification of the cell types was difficult.
2. Under anelectron microscope a continuous or incontinuous labelling of blood group B antigens was seen in contact with the membrane of all normoblasts.
3. The myeloid precursor cells are not labelled, but occasionally limited labelling of the membrane of granulocytic and monocytic cells could be seen.",유남진,1985,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108379954

판례를 통한 정신질환 관련 범죄행위의 내용과 특징 분석,"Among the various crimes, the ones committed by the mentally ill provoke more serious public concern, which is probably caused by such characteristics such as unpredictability, brutality, unknown motives, or random targeting of victims. The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of crimes committed by the mentally ill, to investigate the type of mental disorders and assaulting weapons, and to examine the correlation between the type of mental disorders and their criminal behavior patterns. Through the combination of the forensic and psychological approach, the authors examined the psychological and behavioral characteristics of mentally ill criminals to identify the criminal and behavioral characteristics of crimes committed by them. The cases for this analysis were collected through the search for precedents at National Law Information Center where 19 cases were selected. In conclusion, the diagnoses of mental disorders were schizophrenia, pedophilia, intellectual disability, personality disorder, and depressive disorder, in descending order. Among them, schizophrenia accounted for 6 cases (31.6%), where especially the paranoid type (3 cases) committed the premeditated crimes. Mental handicap was recognized in 9 cases and was rejected in 4 cases. However, in 6 cases, it was not mentioned by court. Further, the judgment of being mental handicapped was made without reference of mental appraisal in 3 out of 19 cases, and so its credibility might be argued. The number of defendants who had past criminal histories was 7 (33.3%) out of 21 defendants, which may illustrate the rate of recidivism of mental disorder criminals.",김윤신,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2060172
목 눌림 질식에 의한 자살 2증례,"In majority of deaths from asphyxiation that affect the cerebral blood flow, compression occurs at the neck. Compressive asphyxia caused by a heavy weight is usually the result of an accident. The authors used the Korean national police agency's scientific crime analysis system to identify two cases of suicide by strangulation which were not otherwise specified, wherein asphyxiation occurred from an object pressing on the neck. In the first case, a man in his 50s died after the compression of his neck with a barbell shaft using a bench press. In the second case, a man in his 80s died due to compression from the side bar of a single bed that pressed on his neck. As far as the authors know, there have been no reported cases of suicide in forensic literature that occurred due to compression from an object such as a barbell shaft of a bench press or a side bar of a bed. Upon classifying the types of asphyxiation, accurate statistics should be prepared and researched, with accurate understanding and classification of the terms therein.

행위분석 관점에서 본 혈흔형태분석과 화재조사의 유사성에 관한 연구,"Crime scene reconstruction is the use of scientific methods, physical evidence,deductive and inductive reasoning and their interrelationships to gain explicit knowledge of the series of events that surround the commission of a crime. Event analysis is the method of crime scene reconstruction. As disciplines of crime scene reconstruction,bloodstain pattern analysis and fire investigation have many common points.
Comparing bloodstain pattern analysis with fire investigation in point view of event analysis helps us to further understand crime scene reconstruction as well as bloodstain pattern analysis and fire investigation themselves. We study event analysis and apply it to cases and we seek similarities and differences between bloodstain pattern analysis and fire investigation by analyzing the methodology of both of them. In a fire scene, the point with the greatest damage is the point where the fire burned longest,which is likely to be the origin. In bloodstained scenes this approach is reversed. The greatest bloodshed point is most likely the ending point of the incident and is likely at or near the point where the bloodshed started. Above this, there are other similarities between them. Mastering the crime scene reconstruction requires long time hard training. Thus if the fire investigation experts or arson experts among crime scene investigators join the field of bloodstain pattern analysis(or reverse), then there will be many synergy effects to both of them.",서영일,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2060178

Two persons who alleged the same maternal lineage were identical on the mitochondrial DNA sequences from 15,960 to 16,569 and from 1 to 533. Other two persons were identical on the mitochondrial DNA sequences from 16221 to 16390 each other. However, seven bases are different on the sequences from 16221 to 16390 between two groups,.

The possible use of the cigarette butts for individual identification was evaluated in sex determination, amplification of D1S80 locus, polymorphisms of HLA-DQA1 gene from the extracted DNA.
1. DNA extraction was possible in cigarette butts left in room temperature for 15 days, so it can be applicable to individual identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
2. Amplification of X-Y homologous amelogenin gene by PCR made it possible to identify the sex in saliva stains (cigarette butts).
3. Amplification of D1S80 locus can be acquired from adding the bovine serum albimine and hot start PCR procedures from forensic samples such as saliva stains (cigarette butts), so the AMP-FLPs examining is possible.
4. Genotype could be determined simply and rapidly using Amplitype?? HLA-DQα forensic kit in examining the HLA-DQA1 gene.
From the investigation, DNA extraction, sex determination, amplification of D1S80 locus, polymorphisms of HLA-DQA1 gene were successfully done even though the cigarette butts were left for 15 days at room temperature.

사후 체온 하강,"Examiners involved in legal medicine are frequently asked questions relating to the precise time of death and athey investigate early postmortem changes which are useful to estimate of the time of death. However, it is one of the most difficult problems because postmortem changes are various and examinated results are subjective.
One of early postmortem changes, the rate of cooling of the body after death can be measured with rectal thermoneter, therefore it is relatively objective. The fall of the body temperature after death depends on Newton's law of cooling that the curve of them has a sigmoid shape with an initial plateau af slow cooling, followed by a relatively straight portion of varying length and a slope corresponding to the period of quickest cooling and finally a slow falling curve of gradually decreasing gradient. And there are several fromulae which can be used in estimating the time of death with rectal temperature. But the rate of cooling of dead body is affected by many factors such as cause of death, physical factors of corpse, environmental factors, naked or clothed condition of corpse,. etc.
Conclusively, it is clear that no formulae is yet known which can help determine the exact time of death because of variable factors influencing on the rate of cooling of body after death. The estimation need not limited to the measurement of postmortem temperature, but should be based on careful evaluation of ass findings.

D8S210 유전자 과변이부위의 클로닝과 한국인에서 집단유전학적 분석을 통한 법의학적 활용성에 관한 연구,"A multi-locus probe. called pHK-450. detecting multiple variable DNA fragments, was constructed by cloning of the 450 bp fragments into pCR?? vector, which could be obtained from amplification of the variable region of the D8S210 locus of human genome with a primer set of UF1. UR1, and UR2. The sequence data shows that the variable region is entirely G-C rich on one strand consisting of tetranucleotide repeat unit (GGAA)n at both margins and internally diversed regions with simple irregular repeat units of GGAA, GGAG, or GGGAA.
The genetic complexixty of the resulting individual-specific DNA patterns was investigated by studying a Korean pedigree(both parents and 10 children). HaeIII and HinfI-generated DNA fragments are inherited to their children in a Mendelian manner with segregation ratio of 1:1.05 and 1:1.14. respectively. In the HinfI-digested genomic DNAs, the segregation of up to 25 variable DNA fragments from both parents could be analysed in a single sibship. Most of these variable DNA fragments detected by pHK-450 probe are not paired as allele, which suggests that they may be derived from 23 heterozygous loci. In the HaeIII-digested genomic DNA, 26 variable DNA fragments are segregated from both parents to 10 children. Excluding one allelic and three linked DNA fragments, 22 out of 26 scored DNA fragments may be derived from 23 hetrozygous loci.
To determine the variability of DNA fragments, DNA samples from 113 unrelated Korean were digested with HinfI and hybridized using pHK-450 probe. Pairwise comparisons of individual variable DNA fragments show that the polymorphic patterns were highly specific to an individual. The mean probaility(X) that fragments in A individual is present in B individual is 0.0337. From the degree of maxiaml sharing, band approximate estimates of mean allele frequency and homozygosity is calculated being 0.187 and the mean heterozygossity is 89.69%.

교통사고시 복부손상의 특징,"The abdomen includes the organs and viscera below the diaphragm and above the pelvic girdle. Although there is little bony structure to protect these organs from blunt impact, injuries to this region is relatively rare. Like the thorax, the abdomen can be the site of injuries sustained by inner parts of the car and restraint systems. As far as the crucial organs are concerned, the liver, spleen and kidneys are most frequently injured, and it seems to be the most serious and life-threatening.
Injury mechanisms of the abdomen are thought to be primarily the result of deformation or penetration of the abdominal contents along with significant force or pressure generation in the deformed organs. In addition, solid organs, such as liver may undergo severe damage due to pressure generation alone at high impact velocities. There is evidence to show that these organs are viscoelastic, that the rate of loading is a crucial factor in injury causation, and that a compressive stress of 310kPa(45psi) will cause a superficial liver injury. Regarding dynamic response of the abdomen, the problem is complicated by the fact that there is a variety of surface geometries and component materials that can impact the abdominal area in a vehicle crash environment. In side impacts, however, the surface such as doors and armrests are somewhat well-defined, and dynamic load-deflection response curves do exist to a limited extent.",이원태,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106070750

However, there has never been any data which tried to analyze the damage patterns through mock grenade explosions. So far, the processes leading to deaths were merely inferred by reconstructing the situation with limited intelligence after the incidents have already occurred. Therefore, the authors believe that having mock grenade explosions in order to compare and study the observances with those of the actual incident will be helpful for a more precise and objective medical jurisprudence,and thus have summarized the damage patterned obtained on 8 butchered pigs, that were 6~8 months old, about 100 cm in length and 70~100 kg in weight by photographing with radioactive rays and running autopsies after detonating grenades on them. In conclusion, if there was extensive loss of body parts, the grenade probably exploded when in contact with the lost body parts. If fractures were found the grenade is likely to have detonated contacting or within 25 cm of distance with the body, and if there were no lacerations or loss of body parts the grenade probably exploded at a distance of at least 50 cm. If soot was prevalent on the deceased’s body, the grenade is likely to have exploded within a distance of 25 cm from the body at a free floating state, in which it was not in contact with the ground or the body. Lastly, if no soot was found, the grenade most probably detonated at a distance of 50 cm or more. The posture or the direction of the body cannot give precise clues of the victim’s state before theexplosion, and a hasty presupposition could be very dangerous in case of contact explosions especially.",최민성,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2059996
