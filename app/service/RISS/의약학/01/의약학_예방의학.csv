The results obtained will be used as a foundational framework for fostering a healthy sleep culture among college students and for formulating measures to improve the quality of their sleep. Ultimately, we intend to produce a publicity and educational material.
Methods : For this study, a survey involving 100 college students was conducted, after which data based on a final total of 95 respondents were analyzed. The information on stress and depression were first analyzed in terms of general characteristics and then organized based on the data collected to investigate the effects of sleep duration on stress and depression. The participants were divided into the following groups: “less than 6 hours,” “6 to 7 hours,” and “7 to 8 hours.” BEPSI-K (Brief encounter psychosocial instrument-Korean) was used for stress evaluation, while K-CESD-R (Korean version of center for epidemiologic studies depression scale-revised) was utilized for depression evaluation.
Results : First, according to sleep duration, the BEPSI-K scores showed a statistically significant difference in each group (p<.01). In the post-hoc test, there was a difference among the “less than 6 hours” group, the “7 to 8 hours” group. A statistically significant difference was noted (p<.01). In addition, sleep duration had a statistically significant effect on the negative (-) direction of the BEPSI-K (p<.01). Second, the K-CESD-R score according to sleep duration showed a statistically significant difference in each group (p<.01). Notably, in the post-hoc test, the “less than 6 hours” group differed from the “6 to 7 hours” group, “7 to 8 hours” group. A statistically significant difference was noted (p<.01). In addition, sleep duration had a statistically significant effect on the negative (-) direction of the K-CESD-R (p<.01). Third, for the correlation between sleep duration and stress and depression, a negative (-) correlation was found between sleep duration and BEPSI-K and K-CESD-R. Meanwhile, a positive (+) correlation was found between BEPSI-K and K-CESD-R.
Conclusion : Based on the findings of this study, the sleep duration of college students has an effect on stress and depression. The results of this study can be used as a foundational framework in formulating a plan for improving the quality of sleep of college students.",김민호 ( Min-ho Kim ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107927717
"대학생의 소외에 대한 두려움, SNS 중독경향성과 우울의 구조적 관계에 관한 조사연구","Purpose : The purpose of this study was to investigate the structural relationships between fear of missing out, addictive tendencies toward social network services (SNSs), and depression in colleges.
Methods : The target subjects were students in colleges across gyeongnam & busan, to whom the purpose of the study was explained and who spontaneously agreed to participate. A survey was conducted with 302 participants over 31 days from March 7, 2022, and data from 299 responses was analyzed.
Results : 1. Women felt a higher fear of missing out than men. 2. Women showed greater inability to control their use of SNSs, more SNS-related disorders in daily life, and greater immersion in and tolerance of SNSs when compared to men. 3. Women were more depressed than men. 4. Positive correlations were observed between the fear of missing out and SNS-addictive tendencies, between the fear of missing out and depression, and between SNS-addictive tendencies and depression.
Conclusion : A comprehensive review of these findings suggests that women had overall higher levels of isolation fear, SNS-addictive tendencies, and depression than men. Based on this, universities should provide gender-specific educational programs around these issues; this student cohort will ultimately work in healthcare, and this kind of awareness will be essential for treating patients. Considering that the current situation poses unusual challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study’s results can serve as basic data for planning educational programs in the future. Over the coming years, comprehensive and continuous education and counselling relating to the fear of missing out, SNS addiction, and depression will be urgently required.",장철,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108247439

아로마테라피 교육 프로그램이 취업준비 여대생의 스트레스와 자기효능감 및 자율신경계에 미치는 영향,"Purpose : The stress of job-seeking college students is gradually worsening due to the continuing recession in the job market. Therefore, this study aims to verify whether intervention with an ‘aromatherapy education program,’ which combines theory and practice, has greater effect on stress, self-efficacy, and autonomic nervous system function than simple inhalation of essential oils in female college students preparing for employment.
Methods : A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted once a week for a total of 4 weeks with 29 female college students preparing for employment. Interventions included essential oil inhalation combined with an aromatherapy education program (experimental group(EG), n=14) and essential oil inhalation alone (control group(CG), n=15); measurements were taken before, immediately after, and 2 weeks after completion of the intervention. Evaluations were conducted using the job-seeking stress scale, stress VAS, self-efficacy scale, and a pulse-wave measuring instrument.
Results : There were significant differences between the CG and EG groups with repeated measurements of job-seeking stress (p=.003), cognitive stress (p<.001), and self-efficacy (p<.001). There was a significant interaction between group and time. There were also significant differences between the CG and EG in terms of autonomic nervous system changes stress index(p=.047), total power(p=.029), high frequency(p=.036), and low frequency/high frequency ratio(p=.049). However, there was no significant difference in low frequency between the groups.
Conclusion : The aromatherapy education program was more effective in improving job-seeking stress, cognitive stress, self-efficacy, and autonomic nervous system function than simple essential oil inhalation. For the aromatherapy education program to be useful as a complementary intervention for stress management in job seekers, it will be necessary to gather additional evidence of its efficacy by conducting follow-up studies with diverse participants and expanding the numbers, and durations, of the interventions.",이은주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108728554

조현병 환자의 정서를 위한 프로그램의 효과: 무작위 대조군 실험연구의 체계적 고찰,"Purpose : This study systematically assessed 9 emotion-function programs for schizophrenic individuals that have been implemented over the past 10 years in Korea and abroad, with the objective of providing clinical grounds and data for further programs.
Methods : This study identified 2,558 studies from among those registered in the RISS, KISS, EMbase, PubMed and Scopus databases from 2013 to September 2023, using ‘schizophrenia’ AND ‘emotion’ AND (‘program’ OR ‘therapy’) as keywords. Of the 2,558 studies retrieved from electronic databases, 602 duplicate papers were excluded. After this process, 1,915 papers that did not meet the study’s inclusion and exclusion criteria were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. Following a review of the texts of the remaining 41 papers, nine papers were finally selected, excluding 32 papers according to the selection and exclusion criteria.
Results : Programs for the emotional function of patients with schizophrenia have continued to be researched. The results of an evaluation on the quality of the selected literature confirmed that a majority of the reviewed items were “uncertain”, confirming that there was a risk of bias. The interventions for emotions included art, cognitive-behavioral, and physical programs, of which art programs were frequently applied. Most of the interventions were implemented in hospitals. The dependent variables for evaluating emotions included emotional expression, depression, anxiety, and positive emotions, and among them, emotional expression was used most frequently. Accordingly, the Berkeley expressivity questionnaire was commonly used as an evaluation tool.
Conclusion : This study is significant for intending to analyze domestic and overseas programs for the emotions of patients with schizophrenia, thereby proposing the direction for planning and applying interventions in clinical settings.

복부 운동 방법에 따른 호흡기능 변화 비교,"Purpose : The enhancement of abdominal muscles increases the activation and contraction of respiratory muscles, including the diaphragm. Generally, diaphragm exercises are applied to increase the breathing ability of patients with respiratory disease. Previous studies have shown that breathing capacity can be increased through abdominal muscle strengthening exercises. However, studies on breathing ability are rare and it is doubtful whether these affect respiratory ability more than diaphragm exercises. Therefore, this study seeks to compare whether abdominal exercises can improve breathing ability and whether any increase is comparable to diaphragm exercises.
Methods : After selecting subjects, the place of intervention was separated for blindness. The plank group was allowed to relax for 30 seconds after 30 seconds of planking; this was set at three and increased by one set each week. Subjects in the draw-in group were allowed to relax for 30 seconds after maintaining the draw-in contraction state for 30 seconds and this was done for 15 minutes. Subjects in the control group underwent abdominal dilation for five seconds of inspiration time and expired air for five seconds by exposing the lips; breathing was performed repeatedly for 15 minutes. Subjects in each group measured their respiration function three times before intervention, three weeks after the commencement of intervention and after intervention. Spirovit SP-1 was used to measure respiratory function. In each group, repeated ANOVA was used to compare the respiratory function over time and one-way ANOVA was used to compare the respiratory function between groups. The post hoc was conducted using the LSD method.
Results : There was a significant increase in respiratory ability between the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) according to the six-week period. However, there was no difference between each group.
Conclusion : For patients with low respiratory muscle strength, plank exercises and abdominal draw-in are beneficial exercises for improving respiratory function. These are expected to be widely used in clinical practice for patients with weak respiratory muscles.",배원식 ( Bae Wonsik ),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106632001
만성 발바닥 근막염 환자에게 물리치료와 코르티코스테로이드 주사가 미치는 효과 비교,"Purpose : This study was to compare the effect changes after physical therapy (extracorporeal shock wave therapy + high-load strengthening exercise) or corticosteroid injection in patients diagnosed with chronic plantar fasciitis.
Methods : A total of 40 patients were randomly assigned to each group of 20. According to the intervention method, “Group 1. Physiotherapy” was performed for 12 weeks, and “Group 2. Corticosteroid injection” was performed only once. As a pre-intervention test, plantar fascia thickness, pain intensity Ⅰ, Ⅱ (What is the most painful moment of the day?, How painful is the first step in the morning?), and functional performance were measured. To compare the effects of each group, the tests 3, 6, and 12 weeks after were also performed using the same measurement method. Also, after 12 weeks, patient satisfaction was also compared.
Results : There was no significant difference between the groups in the change in the thickness of the plantar fascia during all periods. However, pain intensity Ⅰ, Ⅱ was significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2 at only 12 weeks and functional performance was also significantly increased in Group 1 compared to Group 2 at only 12 weeks. Also, there was no significant difference between groups in patient satisfaction.
Conclusion : The physiotherapy protocol, which consisted of extracorporeal shock wave therapy and high-load strengthening exercise, showed excellent results, especially after 12 weeks, compared to corticosteroid injection. It is recommended as a more effective treatment method as it is possible to safely return to daily life by reducing pain and improving functional performance.",추연기 ( Yeon-ki Choo ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107927715

호흡근훈련 유무에 따른 안정화 운동이 건강한 성인의 호흡 기능과 자세 동요에 미치는 영향,"Purpose : Stabilization exercise and respiratory muscle training are used to train trunk muscles that affect postural control and respiratory function. However, there have been no studies that combine stabilization exercise and respiratory muscle training. The purpose of this study is to investigate effects of stabilization exercise with and without respiratory muscle training on respiratory function and postural sway.
Methods : Fifteen healthy adults were recruited for this experiment. All the subjects performed stabilization exercise with and without respiratory muscle training. For stabilization exercise with respiratory muscle training, the subjects sat on a gym ball wearing a stretch sensor. The subjects inspire maximally as long as possible during lifting one foot off the ground, alternately for 30 seconds. The stretch sensor was placed on both anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS), and the stretch sensor was used to monitor inspiration. For stabilization exercise without respiratory muscle training, the subjects sat on a gym ball and lifted one foot off the ground, without respiratory muscle training. Kinovea program used to investigate postural sway tracking during exercise. The maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) were measured using a spirometer to investigate changes of respiratory muscle strength before and after exercise. A paired t-test was used to determine significant differences postural sway tracking, MIP, and MEP between stabilization exercise with and without respiratory muscle training.
Results : There were significantly lower a distance of postural sway tracking during stabilization exercise with respiratory muscle training, compared with stabilization exercise without respiratory muscle training (p<.05). The MIP and MEP were significantly increased after stabilization exercise with respiratory muscle training compared with before stabilization exercise with respiratory muscle trianing (p<.05).

남자간호사의 간호사 되기 경험,"Purpose : Using qualitative research and a phenomenological approach, the present study aimed to explore men’s experiences of becoming a nurse. We posed the question “What has been your experience of becoming a nurse?”
Methods : Eleven male nurses from three regions in Korea were selected through convenience sampling. The protocol suggested by Colaizzi was used for data analysis.
Results : The principal themes were “Challenging to the stochastic stereotype of gender mechanics,” “Floating outside the enclosure of multiple groups,” “The male nurse’s conceptualization of nursing organizations,” “To stand with self-doubt, thinking of it as a stopover,” and “Situations encountered by a male nurse.”
Conclusion : Men experience gender discrimination based on the social roles that are imposed on males and females both at school and in the workplace. They prefer to work where they have more diverse tasks that require quick responses. However, most male nurses adapt to this work by outlasting the difficulties. These nurses become accustomed to their tasks, and satisfied with their mature work performance. They often feel they are not adequately compensated for their work. They may judge the future as uncertain, and have lingering doubts about maintaining their positions, ultimately gravitating toward specialized fields that promise a brighter future and are more consistent with traditional gender expectations.",김수올,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106480598

선택적 기능 동작 평가의 연구 동향 분석,"Purpose : Selective functional movement assessment(SFMA) is a movement-based assessment tool designed for clinicians to diagnose and treat pain and functional physical problems. This concept is used for assistance in occupations related to movement, including clinical medical personnel, such as physical therapists, physical education instructors, and athlete coaches. Although this concept is widely used by clinicians, research and scientific proofs are relatively insufficient. This study aimed to review the literature on the understanding, reliability and effectiveness of SFMA, and to consider its role in the future of rehabilitation.
Methods : In this review, a total of nine articles were selected according to the eligibility criteria of three major thesis topics. The main topics covered in the literature are reliability and effectiveness of clinical use of SFMA. To gather research articles, we searched official term 'Selective Functional Movement Assessment'. Among the searched 60 studies, nine were mentioned in this study that contained overlapping information and matched our desired topic. We reviewed four reliability analyses, four case reports, and one experimental study.
Results : Reliability has an intermediate degree between high raters and within raters. The validity of the SFMA system is influenced by a combination of experience and logic; hence, further improvement is needed. Therefore, if the intervention was effective based on the diagnosis result, then biomechanical evidence is necessary to further support the claim.

한국 건강불평등의 현황과 문제점,"Objectives : The aim of this study is to summarize the current conditions and implications of health inequalities in South Korea. Methods : Through a literature review of empirical studies and supplementary analysis of the data presented in the 1998, 2001, and 2005 KNHANEs, we evaluated the extent and trends of socioeconomic inequalities in both health risk factors, such as smoking, physical activity, and obesity, and outcomes, such as total mortality, subjective poor health status by self-reports and metabolic syndrome. Relative risks and odds ratios were used to measure differences across socioeconomic groups, and the relative index of inequality was used to evaluate the changes in inequalities over time. Results : We found clear inequalities to various degrees?in most health indicators. While little change was observed in mortality differences over time, the socioeconomic gaps in risk factors and morbidity have been widening, with much larger differences among the younger population. Conclusions : Socioeconomic inequalities are pervasive across various health indicators, and some of them are increasing. The trends in socioeconomic inequalities in health should be carefully monitored, and comprehensive measures to alleviate health inequalities are needed, especially for young populations.",김유미,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101437824

가상현실환경에서 정상성인의 거울보행이 보행특성에 미치는 영향,"Purpose : The study aims to see the effects of virtual reality and non-virtual reality in a normal person’s mirror walk on gait characteristics.
Methods : Twenty male adults (Age; 27.8±5.8) took part in the study. The subjects attached reflection markers for motion analysis, and walked aware of the virtual reality environment with mirrors wearing goggles showing them virtual environments. After gait in a virtual environment, the subjects walked in a non-virtual environment with mirrors a certain distance away after taking a five minute break. To prevent the order effect cause by the experiential difference of gait order, ten subjects were chosen randomly into groups and the order was differentiated. In each gait, infrared camera was used to detect motion and the position of the markers were saved real time.
Results : Comparison between virtual and non-virtual reality mirror walks showed that the movable range of leg joints (ankle, knee and hip joint), body joints (sacroiliac, atlantoaxial joint), arm joints (shoulder, wrist joint) showed meaningful differences. Temporal characteristics showed that virtual gaits speed were slower, and the cycle time and double limb support time of the gaits were longer. Furthermore, spacial characteristics showed that virtual gaits were shorter in steps length and strides length, the stride width longer and center of movement horizontally longer.
Conclusion : The reduction in joint movement in virtual reality is due to adverse effects on balance and efficiency during gait. Also, the change in temporal-spatial characteristics of gait would be due to change in gait mechanisms for balance, showing that virtual gaits are more demanding than the other. However, the subject group is a normal group with no abnormality in gait ability and balance ability, and it is not clear whether the decrease in performance is the result of environment or fear. Therefore it is necessary to understand whether the subject group's improvement and fear affect the result in future studies.",이재호,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108247389

임신기 치주질환과 자간전증 발생간의 연관성,"Purpose : Preeclampsia(PE) is a pregnancy-specific disease which is characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. This disease occurs in about 2-8% of pregnancies in developing countries and remains among the major causes of maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity throughout the world. Although the causes of PE are not fully understood, the infection has been considered as the main risk factor for this diseases.
Periodontal disease may provide a chronic burden of endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines and the disease has been considered as risk factors of systemic illnesses including cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, and cerebrovascular ischemia. So, studies performed over the last 15 years have suggested that periodontal disease may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes such as PE. However, this association has not been found in all populations. The aim of this review article was to evaluate whether periodontal status and the presence of specific periodontal pathogens may influence the incidence of PE.
Method : Many research articles searched at the electronic databases(MEDLINE; 2000 to July 2017) including search term as periodontal disease and preeclampsia.
Result : There were 11 case-control studies and 5 cohort studies meeting our inclusion criteria. The results showed that maternal periodontitis (adjusted odds ratio: 1.5 to 9.3) was associated with preeclampsia in 16 epidemiological studies.
Conclusion : It is clear that maternal periodontitis is a risk factor associated with preeclampsia, emphasizing the importance of periodontal care in prenatal programs.",하정은,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105271274

우리나라 직장인 피로의 역학적 특성,"Objective : To elucidate the correlates of self-rated fatigue in Korean employees. Methods : The data for 10,176 (men, 7,984; women, 2,192; mean age, 34.2; SD: 8.8) employees recruited from a nationwide sample were examined. A structured questionnaire was used to measure the participants' fatigue, sociodemographics (sex, age, education, and marital status), job-related characteristics (work duration, grade at work, work hours, shiftwork, employment type, and magnitude of workplace), and health-related habits (smoking, drinking, coffee intake, and exercise). Two types of measurement for fatigue were used to evaluate the magnitude of fatigue: self-rated question and a standardized measurement tool (Multidimensional Fatigue Scale: MFS). Results : According to the self-rated fatigue, 32% of employees reported that they felt fatigue for the past two weeks, and 9.6% of males and 8.7% of females had experienced excessive fatigue (6 months or more). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that fatigue measured by MFS was more common in women, younger, college or more graduated, single, and employees who do not regularly exercise. Fatigue was also associated with long work hours, and the size of the workplace (<1,000 employees). Conclusions : These results suggest that fatigue has been considered as a common complaint, and that it is affected by job-related factors like work hours and the workplace size as well as sociodemographics or health-related behaviors. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of fatigue on adverse health outcomes, work performance, work disability, sick absence and medical utilization, and to examine the relationship of job characteristics (e.g.: work demand, decision latitude) to fatigue.",장세진,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101437760
그립 유형에 따른 탄력밴드 저항운동 효과의 비교 연구 ; 유방절제술로 발생한 팔 림프부종 환자에 대한 통증 및 어깨관절가동범위에 대하여,"Purpose : The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of upper extremity volume, pain, and range of motion after participation in thera-band exercises according to the hand grip type in patients with breast cancer with upper extremity edema. We also aimed to determine the most efficient type of grip.
Methods : The subjects were 10 female patients diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer who had stage 2 lymphedema. Randomly, 5 patients each were allocated to the experimental and control groups. For six weeks, the patients in both the experimental and control groups exercised daily. In both groups, manual lymph drainage was applied for 1 hour. Afterward, patients in the experimental group placed their hands in the thera-band ring and exercised with their fingers outstretched. Patients in the control group exercised while holding the thera-band ring with a finger. Both the experimental group and the control group underwent measurements of the circumference of the upper extremity, pain, and range of motion of the shoulder joint at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6 before and after exercise.
Results : The upper arm circumference decreased by more in the experimental group in all weeks than before than that in the control group, and there was a statistically significant difference at 6 weeks. Compared with the difference between pre-exercise and 6 weeks post-exercise, the change in pain significantly decreased in the experimental group and showed a statistically significant difference. The shoulder range of motion increased in extension, external rotation, and internal rotation compared with that in the control group, and there was a statistically significant difference. Although the operating range increased in flexion and abduction, there were no statistically significant differences.
Conclusion : In this study, we found that thera-band exercises with an open-hand grip are more efficient than thera-band exercises with a closed-hand grip in edema reduction, pain, and range of motion. In addition, it was found that it was more effective to continue the thera-band exercises with open-hand grip extended for at least 6 weeks rather than for a short time.",조예진 ( Jo Yejin ),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106631993

The quality of life [using the brief pain inventory (BPI) and the headache impact test (HIT)], and the frequency, duration, and intensity of the headache [on a visual analog scale (VAS)] were assessed before and after the treatment, and at the follow-up.
Results : After 4 weeks of SMT, the frequency (p<.001), duration (p<.05), and intensity (p<.001) of the headache and the quality of life (HIT; p <.001, BPI; p<.001) significantly improved in the patients with TTH. The improvement in these parameters remained significant even after 6 months of follow-up. Similarly, After 4 weeks of MT, the frequency (p<.05), duration (p<.05), and intensity (p<.01) of the headache, and the quality of life (HIT; p<.05, BPI; p<.001) significantly improved in the patients with TTH. The improvement in these parameters remained significant even after 6 months of follow-up. There was no significant difference in these parameters between the two groups.
Conclusion : It has been suggested that MT using the SMT can be used as a non-invasive treatment to treat the frequency, duration, and intensity of the TTH, and to improve the quality of life.",이화경 ( Hwa-gyeong Lee ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107473144

Methods : In order to find out the studies on the effect of social story intervention on individuals with ASD, studies published from 2011 to December 2020 were searched on Google Academic Search. The keywords used were ""autism spectrum disorder AND social story"". A total of 16,900 studies were searched, and from these, 12 studies were selected based on the application of the selection and exclusion criteria. The included studies comprised of 10 single subject design studies and 2 randomized controlled trials design studies. The included studies were analyzed in accordance to population, intervention, outcome measures and results.
Results : As a result of analysing the subjects of the included studies, we found out that pre-school children and adolescents were the most common groups of individuals diagnozsed with ASD. In addition to ASD, the diagnosis of the subjects included intellectual disability, Asperger, and Prader-willi. We found out that there were more interventions that were mixed with other interventions, than just the pure social story interventions. In particular, video modeling was found to be the most frequent intervention. This was followed by photo-based social stories.
For outcome measure, autism social skills profile was found to be the most often used standardized assessment. For a non-standardized assessment, social desired behavior was found to be the most frequently evaluated behavior, followed by personal problem behavior. Of all the dependent variables, the dependent variable reported as ""effective"" was the most, followed by ""some effective"".
Conclusion : This study is organized to help the individuals with ASD, families, researchers, and therapists understand the effects of social story intervention on the individuals with ASD in an easy fashion. Further, therapists can use this study as the basic data for evidence-based practice.",배원진 ( Won-jin Bae ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107473145
Pre-pregnancy Diet to Maternal and Child Health Outcome: A Scoping Review of Current Evidence,"Objectives: Pre-pregnancy diet has an important role in preparing for healthy generation. However, evidence on this issue has been scarce. A scoping review synthesising current evidence will support the demand to map ‘what has been researched’ on pre-pregnancy diet and maternal and child health.Methods: Systematic search was performed using PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study design) framework in electronic databases. Articles were screened for eligibility, summarized, and the quality was assessed using the National Institute of Health assessment tool. The review structure complies with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guide.Results: Forty-two articles were included after full-text screening. Twenty-five studies were in high-income countries (HICs), six in each upper-middle income, five in lower-middle income countries (LMICs), and one in low-income countries (LIC). Based on the regions: North America (n=16), Europe (n=5), South America (n=4), Australia (n=4), Asia (n=5), Middle East (n=2), and sub-Saharan Africa (n=1). The two-most observed diet-related exposures were dietary pattern (n=17) and dietary quality (n=12). The most assessed outcome was gestational diabetes mellitus (n=28) and fetal and newborn anthropometry (n=7). The average quality score±standard deviation was 70±18%.Conclusions: Research related to pre-pregnancy diet is still concentrated in HICs. The context of diet may vary; therefore, future research is encouraged in LMICs and LICs context, and Mediterranean, South-East Asia, Pacific, and African regions.

"저항성 운동이 여성 노인의 신체조성, 체력, 혈중지질 및 인슐린에 미치는 영향","Purpose : This study aimed to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of resistance exercise on body composition, physical strength, blood lipids, and insulin.
Methods : The study was conducted on 24 elderly women divided into two groups: 12 subjects in an exercise group and 12 subjects in a control group. Resistance exercise was performed for 50 minutes a day, three times a week, for the duration of 12 weeks, and body composition, physical strength, blood lipids, and insulin were measured before and after the subjects completed the program. For the statistical analysis, the mean and standard deviation (M±SD) of each variable were calculated using SPSS version 20, and a paired t-test and two-way repeated ANOVA were conducted to test for the differences before and after the resistance exercise. All significant levels were set to α=.05 as a result of the experiment.
Results : Changes in body composition after the 12-week resistance exercise program did not show any significant difference based on the comparison between the groups, but when noting the values for body fat percentage and body in the control group before and after, a significant difference was shown in fat mass (p<.05). As for changes in physical fitness, significant differences appeared in flexibility, muscle strength, and stenotic force (p<.01) when the groups were compared. Regarding pre- and post-values within each group concerning flexibility within the exercise group, significant differences were shown in gender (p<.001), muscle strength (p<.05), (p<.01), muscle earth strength, equilibrium (p<.01), stenosis force, and cardiopulmonary earth force (p<.001). Also, comparisons between populations in changes in blood lipids the values before and after in each group, significant differences in glucose (p<.05) and insulin (p<.05) were shown in the exercise group.

Activity goals and contents were predetermined for each subject for each session, and a total of 10 sessions of the program was applied for 10 weeks. Self-esteem and parenting efficacy prior to and after the program of the subjects were measured by using corresponding self-esteem and parenting efficacy scales. Measurement data were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney Test.
Results : It was possible to observe that the self-esteem and parenting efficacy of the subjects in the experimental group to whom the art therapy program was applied underwent more significant changes in comparison to those of the control group (p<.01).
Conclusion : Group art therapy induces social support experiences of group therapy and an improvement of an assertive attitude towards art therapy. Since there was a significant improvement of self-esteem and parenting efficacy in the results of this study when the group art therapy program is applied, it is believed its clinically meaningful application would be possible. In particular, it can be utilized in programs for disabled children in a family unit from the perspective that it improves parenting efficacy, which can impart an affirmative effect not only to the main rear but also to all the family members.",송은주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101721002

Results : As for the level of evidence of the included studies, level Ⅰ consisted of five studies, and levels Ⅱ and Ⅲ each had one article. As a result of the bias evaluation of five studies through RoB, a “low risk of bias” was found for incomplete result data, selective result reporting, and others, except for four unclear evaluation areas. The “low risk of bias” ratio was 0~25 % in the evaluation of bias in two studies through RoBANS. For the evaluation tool, cognitive evaluation tool was used the most while mini-mental state examination-Korea was used the most frequently. For the intervention method, the most frequently used was group art therapy that employed recall in three studies, while collage, Korean painting, use of paper media, and procedural memory were used in each of the other studies. Each intervention was found to be significantly effective overall.
Conclusion : This study provided clinical evidence by systematically reporting research on group art therapy for older people with dementia. In the future, it is necessary to check the effect of group art therapy on various areas other than cognition for older people with dementia. Moreover, the study should be conducted with the risk of bias sufficiently taken into consideration.",김도연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106363565
"국소적 전기근육자극을 결합한 기구 필라테스가 유방절제술 후 유방암 환자의 통증, 림프부종 및 팔 관절가동범위에 미치는 효과 : 무작위 교차실험 연구","Purpose : Lymphedema is a common complication in mastectomy patients and is usually characterized by pain, swelling, and limited range of motion (ROM) in the arm. Electromyostimulation (EMS) is widely used for the rehabilitation and recovery of subjects with various neuromusculoskeletal disorders after breast cancer. However, EMS has not yet been used in many Pilates exercises. This study was aimed at comparing the effects of instrument Pilates integrated with EMS on pain, lymphedema, and ROM of the upper extremity (UE) in breast cancer subjects after mastectomy.
Methods : Nine female breast cancer subjects who had undergone mastectomy participated in the study. The subjects underwent instrument Pilates with EMS (experimental group) or instrument Pilates only (control group). Pain, lymphedema, and ROM of the UE were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS), the circumference length of the UE, and the ROM of the UE. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the pain, lymphedema, and ROM of the arm before and after the intervention, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the two groups. The statistical significance level was set to p < .05.
Results : In the experimental group, there were significant differences in pain (p<.05) and UE circumference (p<.05) before and after intervention. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in VAS (p>.05) or circumference length of the UE (p>.05). There was one significant difference between the groups in terms of internal rotation of the ROM of the UE (p<.05).
Conclusion : These results show that instrument Pilates exercises combined with EMS may positively affect the internal rotation of the ROM of the UE in breast cancer patients after mastectomy, thus contributing to existing knowledge about instrument Pilates using EMS for the effective management of in breast cancer subjects after mastectomy.",강채영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106363575
내부 충돌증후군을 가진 고등학교 야구선수들을 위한 물리치료적 중재법 : 편심성 훈련과 동심성 훈련의 효과 비교,"Purpose : The purpose of this study was to suggest a more effective method by comparing the effects of changes in pain intensity, muscle strength, and athletic performance after applying a 6-week eccentric training program (ET-MWM) or concentric training program (CT-MWM) with MWM for high school baseball players with shoulder internal impingement (SII).
Methods : A total of 75 participants were randomly assigned to each group and divided into two groups, ""ET-MWM group (n=35)"" and ""CT-MWM group (n=32)"" according to the intervention method. Pain intensity, muscle strength (external rotation, internal rotation), and athletic performance were first measured before the intervention, and after the intervention 3 times a week for a total of 6 weeks, both groups were re-measured in the same way. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain intensity, biodex dynamometer for muscle strength (60 °/sec.), and Kerlan-Jobe orthopedic clinic shoulder & elbow score (K-KJOC) for athletic performance.
Results : As a result of analyzing the homogeneity of the pre-intervention characteristics and initial measurement variables of the study subjects, there was no significant difference between the two groups in all variable values.
Pain intensity (VAS) was significantly reduced in the ET-MWM group than in the CT-MWM group (p<.05). In addition, the maximum muscle strength of external rotation & internal rotation of the shoulder (60 °/sec.) and athletic performance (K-KJOC) were significantly increased in the ET-MWM group than in the CT-MWM group (p<.05).
Conclusion : Compared with the CT-MWM training program, the ET-MWM training program reduced shoulder joint pain and further increased the muscle strength required for throwing motion in high school baseball players. As the result showed better athletic performance improvement, the ET-MWM training program can be clinically recommended as a more effective intervention.",추연기,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106363572
무릎 스쿼트 운동과 스쿼트 운동 자세에 따른 뇌졸중 환자의 균형 비교 연구,"Purpose : The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient exercising method by measuring and comparing the movement of center of pressure (COP) while hemiplegic stroke patients perform kneeling squat exercise and squat exercise.
Methods : 17 hemiplegic stroke patients were instructed to perform kneeling squat exercises and squat exercises, and the research was designed as a cross-over study. For data collection, a pressure distribution measurement platform (PDM) was used to measure the movement area, length, speed, and distance from the center of the X-axis of center of pressure. The data was then analyzed through a paired t-test.
Results : Kneeling squat exercises have been found to have a significantly smaller center of pressure movement area compared to that of squat exercise(p<.001), and the center of pressure movement length of kneeing squat exercise has also been found to be relatively shorter (p<.001). Moreover, kneeling squat exercises have been found to have a significantly slower center of pressure movement speed than squat exercise (p<.001), and kneeing squat exercise center of pressure movement distance from the center of the X-axis has been found to be significantly small (p<.001).
Conclusion : Kneeling squat exercises have significantly decreased amounts of center of pressure movement area, distance, and speed compared to squat exercises. Also, the center of pressure movement distance from the center of the X-axis was relatively closer. This result seems to derive from patients performing their motions with wide base surfaces while being refrained from using unstable ankle joints during kneeing squat exercise. Therefore, it can be concluded that kneeing squat exercises show relatively balanced center of pressure movements between the paralyzed and non-paralyzed sides because kneeling squats show smaller shakes in the center of pressure.",고관혁,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106363574

Methods : 30 subjects participated in the experiment. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups. 15 subjects performed ring fit adventure core exercise (experimental group) and 15 subjects bridge and dead bug exercise (control group). The ring fit adventure core exercise program consists of 6 types, 1) bow pull, 2) overhead lunge twist, 3) pendulum bend, 4) seated ring raise, 5) plank, 6) warrior III pose. Each exercise was performed for 5 minutes, for a total of 30 minutes. The bridege and dead bug exercise were performed for 15 minutes each for a total of 30 minutes. All interventions were performed 3 times a week for 4 weeks. Thickness of the abdominal muscles was measured with a ultrasound. The paired t-test was used to compare the thickness of the transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique before and after intervention, and the comparison between groups was analyzed using the independent t-test.
Results : As a result, in the experimental group, thickness of transverse abdominis and internal oblique increased significantly (p<.05), but external oblique decreased significantly (p<.05), and in the control group, thickness of transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique increased significantly (p<.05). There was a significant difference in external oblique in the difference between groups (p<.05).
Conclusion : These study results showed that core exercise using ring fit adventure can reduce external oblique and increased selective muscle activity of transverse abdominis and internal oblique of the deep abdominal muscles, so it is meaningful as an effective intervention for core stabilization.",윤삼원,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108360562
둥근 어깨가 있는 대상자에게 골반 압박 벨트 적용을 동반한 어깨 안정화 운동의 수행이 어깨관절 주위 근육의 근활성도와 통증 및 기능에 미치는 영향,"Purpose : The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of shoulder stabilization exercise accompanied by application of a pelvic compression belt on the muscle activity, pain and function of the muscles around the shoulder in subjects with round shoulders.
Methods : For the study method, 28 students who were enrolled in K University with a distance of 1 ㎝ or more between the clavicle of the peak and the outer ear path were selected through GPS 400 global postural analysis system measurement. The subjects were randomly assigned to 14 participants in the group wearing a pelvic compression belt and 14 patients in the group not wearing a pelvic compression belt. In all subjects, the muscle activities of the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles and the shoulder pain disorder index (SPADI) were measured. The intervention was performed 3 times a week for 4 weeks, and the applied intervention was push-up plus and modified prone cobra exercise. The muscle activities of the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior muscles and SPADI score were compared using dependent t test before and after intervention.
Results : In this study, both groups showed that the muscle activity of the middle trapezius, lower trapezius, and serratus anterior significantly increased after the intervention compared to before the intervention. On the other hand, SPADI showed no significant difference.
Conclusion : The results of this study showed that muscle activity in the peri-shoulder joint was increased after push-up plus and modified prone cobra exercise in both groups, regardless of whether pelvic compression was applied or not. Therefore, it was found that shoulder stabilization exercise using the pelvic compression belt also contributed to the enhancement of muscle activity in the joints around the shoulder.",김충유,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108360590

Methods : The subjects of this study were 24 stroke patients selected by inclusion criteria. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: robot assisted gait training (n=11) and general neurological physical therapy group (n=11). In the robot-assisted gait training group, robot-assisted gait training was mediated for 30 minutes a day in addition to general neurological physical therapy. The general neurological physical therapy group was mediated by general neurological physical therapy for 30 minutes a day in addition to general neurological physical therapy. The number of interventions was 5 times a week for 5 weeks. In order to compare the kinematic factors of walking between the two groups, gait analysis was performed before and after 5 weeks of training using the Zebris gait analysis system.
Results : As a result of the gait analysis of the two groups, there were significant differences in temporospatial gait variables (step length, stride length, step width, step time, stride time), gait cycle ratio (swing phase, stance phase) and gait line length. However, there was no significant difference in the cadence (temporospatial gait parameters) in the robot assisted gait training group compared to general neurological physical therapy group.
Conclusion : It is considered to be a useful treatment for stroke patients to promote the recovery of gait function in stroke patients. Based on the results of this study, continuous robot assisted gait training treatment is considered to have a positive effect on gait ability, the goal of stroke rehabilitation.
