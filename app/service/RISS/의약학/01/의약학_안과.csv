한국인의 근시와 위험인자 : 국내 역학연구에 관한 고찰,"Myopia is the most common refractive error throughout the world and the prevalence of myopia demonstrates regional and ethnic differences. Numerous studies have reported the association of myopia with risk factors including young age, urban residence, high educational level of subjects or of their parents, or high income. However, association of one specific risk factor with myopia is not always consistent in published studies and multivariate analyses report different associations according to the variables that were included. The Korean Ophthalmological Society has participated in the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) since July 2008 and has conducted nationwide epidemiological survey. The epidemiology of refractive errors in Korean population from KNHANES 2008-2012 was reported on behalf of the Epidemiologic Survey Committee of the Korean Ophthalmological Society recently. The nationwide prevalence of myopia from the KNHANES data demonstrated biphasic distribution by age; Myopia prevalence in Korean population increased as age increased from childhood to young adulthood with the highest prevalence in adolescents and young adults aged between 12 and 29 years. The prevalence then showed decreasing pattern as age increased in adult age groups with the exception of a small increase in the oldest age group of 70 years or older. Studies based on KNHANES data demonstrated various associations of myopia with urban residence, female gender, education, and other risk factors in various age groups. Risk factors of myopia in the Korean population are discussed with possible differential association of myopia with certain risk factors in different age groups.",백승희(Seung-Hee Baek),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108661079
봉합사를 이용한 공막고정술과 변형된 Yamane 무봉합공막고정술의 단기 임상 결과 비교,"Purpose: To compare and investigate the short-term clinical outcomes between 10-0 polypropylene sutured intraocular lens (IOL) scleral fixation and modified Yamane sutureless IOL scleral fixation in patients with IOL or crystalline les dislocation and aphakic state. Methods: From August 2012 to May 2022, medical records were retrospectively analyzed for 43 patients with sutured scleral fixation and 40 patients with sutureless scleral fixation. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), total astigmatism, IOL astigmatism, refractive error, corneal endothelial cell density, surgical time and complications were compared before surgery, 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. Results: In the two groups, after 3 months of surgery, UCVA and BCVA improved compared to before surgery, but there was no significant difference between two groups. The absolute refractive error and total astigmatism for one week after surgery and IOL astigmatism for one week and one month after surgery were significantly lower in sutureless fixation group. There was no significant difference in postoperative corneal endothelial cell density changes between two groups, and total surgical time and IOL fixation time were measured significantly lower in sutureless fixation group. Conclusions: Although modified Yamane sutureless IOL scleral fixation did not show significant improvement in visual acuity compared with conventional sutured IOL scleral fixation, sutureless fixation provided better stability of IOL in the early stages after surgery and short in the surgical time. So it can be an effective alternative to conventional sutured scleral fixation in patients with IOL or crystalline lens dislocation and aphakic state.",김태환(Tae Hwan Kim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107247163
한국인에서 7년간의 안압 변화와 전신인자 변화의 연관성: 종단적 연구,"Purpose: To investigate the changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) and associated systemic factors over 7 years in a healthy Korean population.
Methods: This longitudinal study included healthy subjects with no history of ocular disease and who had been receiving health examinations seven years apart at the Konkuk University Medical Center, Healthcare Center. The participants completed lifestyle questionnaires and underwent general health examinations (blood pressure, height and weight, and blood biochemical tests) and ocular examinations including noncontact tonometry and fundus photography. Subjects with abnormal fundus photography findings and ocular hypertension were excluded. Changes in IOP and systemic factors over 7 years were analyzed.
Results: Of 524 possible subjects, 469 were enrolled (55 subjects were excluded: 50 due to abnormal fundus photography and 5 for missing data). The left eye was analyzed in all patients. In all subjects, initial IOP (mean 14.50 ± 3.14 mmHg) was not significantly different from final IOP (14.72 ± 3.38 mmHg) (paired t-test, p = 0.074). In male patients, the final IOP was significantly higher than the initial IOP (paired t-test, p = 0.035). Lifestyle questionnaire variables were associated with a final IOP that was significantly higher than the initial IOP (smokers, alcohol drinkers and less exercisers, paired t-test; p = 0.014, 0.010 and 0.024, respectively). A linear mixed-effects model analysis showed that the change in IOP was negatively associated with age, but this was not statistically significant. Changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (T.Chol) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) were positively correlated with change in IOP.

전신홍반루프스 환자에서 발생한 망막병증,"Purpose: To investigate the clinical characteristics of retinopathy associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and its risk
factors.
Methods: Medical records of patients who were diagnosed with SLE were reviewed retrospectively. The presence of retinal
hemorrhage, vasculitis and a cotton wool patch were regarded as lupus retinopathy, but concomitant diabetic retinopathy and
hypertensive retinopathy were excluded from the study. The correlation between the development of lupus retinopathy and the
presence of positive autoantibodies was also investigated.
Results: Ocular morbidity was found in 173 of 260 (66%) SLE patients. Retinopathy was detected in 52 eyes of 33 patients (12%),
which included 36 eyes of 21 patients (63%) with classic retinopathy and 11 eyes of 10 patients (30%) with vaso-occlusive
retinopathy. The presence of classic retinopathy coincided with the flare-up of lupus activity and completely resolved without
visual impairment. However, vaso-occlusive retinopathy was not related with lupus activity, and resulted in significant visual
impairments of 20/200 or less in six eyes of five patients. The disease activity of lupus assessed by the maximum SLE disease
activity index was higher in patients with retinopathy (p<0.05), and the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibody was higher in
patients with vaso-occlusive retinopathy than in patients with classic retinopathy (66.7% vs. 37.5%, p<0.05).
Conclusions: Vaso-occlusive retinopathy in SLE can result in permanent visual impairment. Patients with high SLE activity
or positive anti-phospholipid antibodies have a high possibility of developing SLE retinopathy and should be referred for
ophthalmologic examination.",윤창기,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106919862

선택적 레이저 섬유주성형술의 녹내장수술로의 진행 예방에 대한 성공인자 분석,"Purpose: To investigate the factors predicting successful selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) to prevent glaucoma progression to surgery in patients whose intraocular pressure (IOP) is not controlled with medications.
Methods: This retrospective chart review included 102 eyes of 92 glaucoma patients who underwent SLT between 2018 and 2020. Success was defined as the prevention of glaucoma surgery for at least 1 year with an IOP less than 21 mmHg or no progression of retinal nerve fiber layer thinning. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model were used for the analysis.
Results: A low pretreatment IOP, good visual acuity, and a smaller visual field defect were significantly correlated with success.
When the other eye underwent glaucoma surgery or its SLT treatment failed, the success rate of SLT was lower. As the pretreatment IOP increased by 1 mmHg, the SLT failure rate increased by 1,376 times and when the SLT for the other eye failed, it increased by 19,577 times. When the mean deviation of the visual field increased by 1 decibel (dB), the SLT failure rate decreased by 0.928 times (p < 0.05).
Conclusions: SLT is more effective in early glaucoma patients with an IOP lower than 25 mmHg, smaller visual field defect, and good visual acuity to prevent glaucoma progression to surgery.",서현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107379387

Methods: We conducted an update of the most recent and high quality systematic reviews (Canadian Agency for Drug Technology in Health [CADTH] 2016). Three randomized clinical trials were added to 13 trials identified from the CADTH report.
The efficacy outcomes were 1) average improvement in visual acuity, 2) proportion of patients who experienced an improvement in vision (an increase in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of ≥ 15 on Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letters), and 3) proportion of patients who experienced worsening of vision (decrease in BCVA of ≥ 15 ETDRS letters). In addition, safety outcomes included systemic adverse events and ocular-related adverse events. To analyze the outcomes of 16 randomized controlled trials, we conducted meta-analyses on the outcome measures.
Results: There was no significant difference in efficacy outcomes among anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs. The mean difference in BCVA between ranibizumab and bevacizumab was 0.33 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.29, 1.95), and the odds ratio (OR) for a vision gain in the BCVA of ≥ 15 ETDRS letters for the ranibizumab versus aflibercept treatment was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.30). There was also no significant difference in safety outcomes, except in terms of arterial thromboembolic events (ranibizumab vs. bevacizumab; OR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.04, 4.41).
Conclusions: The efficacy of anti-VEGF drugs for AMD patients was not significantly different. The safety of the drugs was also not significantly different, except in terms of arterial thromboembolic events.",강민주,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107767036
중간포도막염 환자에서 레이저홍채절개술 후 발생한 방수흐름이상증후군,"Purpose: We report a case of aqueous misdirection syndrome triggered by pilocarpine use after laser iridotomy, which was treated by pars plana vitrectomy and phacoemulsification.
Case summary: A 48-year-old female patient presented with sudden-onset right eye pain and decreased vision. The patient had presented to another institute with similar symptoms 20 days prior; she had been diagnosed with acute angle closure. Laser iridotomy was performed, followed by administration of pilocarpine twice daily. In the right eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 31 mmHg. The laser iridotomy site was located at the 11 o’clock position; microcysts, anterior chamber cells, corneal endothelium precipitates, and glaukomflecken were observed. The anterior chamber was shallow due to forward movement of the lens and iris. Despite the application of atropine and pressure-lowering eyedrops, anterior chamber shallowing continued along with a progressive myopic shift of -4.5 diopters. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with aqueous misdirection syndrome. Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, followed by phacoemulsification, intraocular lens insertion, and posterior capsulotomy. During surgery, vitreous inflammation, a peripheral snowball, and an anterior hyaloid inflammatory membrane were observed, indicating the presence of intermediate uveitis.
Conclusions: The administration of miotics after laser iridotomy, intraocular inflammation, and uveitis can lead to aqueous misdirection syndrome.

Case summary: A 51-year-old woman presented with diplopia, dizziness, and pain in the right eye and was diagnosed with oculomotor palsy in the right eye. Magnetic resonance imaging of her brain was normal but glycated hemoglobin concentration was 13.4%. After 2 months, the third nerve palsy in the right eye had recovered completely but a new third nerve palsy occurred in the left eye. 1 month later, the symptoms had improved, and the patient did not return to our clinic until 18 months later, when she returned with new diplopia. This time, she was diagnosed with a sixth nerve palsy in the left eye and was observed while controlling her blood sugar. She recovered after 4 months.
Conclusions: Generally, cranial nerve palsies occur unilaterally in situations that can cause ischemia, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and hyperlipidemia. Rarely, they occur bilaterally, or two or more cranial nerve palsies occur simultaneously.
However, it is very rare that cranial nerve palsy occurs sequentially in both eyes under the same systemic blood sugar control.
Diabetic patients with poor blood sugar control require long-term monitoring, considering the possibility of symptoms developing in both eyes with a time lag or other forms of ischemic cranial nerve palsy.",최주원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107867768
마이봄샘 기능이상에서 두 가지 안구건조증 설문지와 안구건조증 지표와의 연관성,"Purpose: The Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and the Standardized Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) which are standard questionnaires of dry eye syndrome were used to determine the associations between clinical dry eye tests and meibomian gland dysfunctions (MGD).
Methods: Forty-one patients with MGD were enrolled in this study. The score of the dry eye syndrome questionnaire and the degree of blepharitis (score: 0-4), Schirmer test results, degree of fluorescence staining of cornea (Oxford Grading System), tear break-up time (TBUT), Pentacam imaging, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography results were used to compare and analyze the results of each test for possible correlations with the dry eye questionnaire answers.
Results: There was a significant correlation between OSDI and SPEED (R = 0.278, p = 0.011). SPEED was correlated with the Oxford grade (R = 0.478, p < 0.001) and MGD grade (R = 0.280, p = 0.011) while there was no significant correlation with corneal aberrations, tear meniscus height, tear meniscus area, Schirmer test results, or TBUT. The OSDI correlated with the MGD grade (R = 0.651, p < 0.001), TBUT (R = -0.360, p = 0.001), and age (R = -0.230, p = 0.037). Using multiple regression analyses, the MGD grade affected the OSDI (β = 0.580, p < 0.001) and the Oxford grade significantly influenced the SPEED (β = 0.447, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: In Koreans, the OSDI questionnaire answers were associated with the MGD grade and SPEED questionnaire answers were associated with the corneal surface status. The OSDI questionnaire was therefore clinically useful in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction.",김진아,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106919841
모바일 앱 기반 자동굴절력계의 임상성능 분석,"Purpose : The mobile app-based auto refractometerb (NETRA refraction mobilized, NR), developed by EYENETRA in the United States, is a device that measures refractive errors by operating the device directly by the test subject, and in order to confirm the clinical performance of NR, the measured values of subjective refraction (SR) and HRK-8000 were compared and analyzed.
Methods : This study recruited 124 patients (248 eyes) with myopia or myopic astigmatism, no systemic disease or eye disease under treatment, and no history of ophthalmic surgery from the customers of M optical store in Gyeonggi-do. The tests were conducted in the order of NR, HRK-8000, and SR to obtain a refractive error measurement result. The SPSS program (version 26) was used for statistical analysis, and a case of p<0.050 was judged statistically significant.
Results : Spherical, cylindrical, and spherical equivalent refractive powers were measured to have the highest myopia in NR measurements (p<0.01), and the average value compared to SR showed a lager difference in NR than HRK-8000, out of the standard deviation range.
In the ±5° range, the astigmatic axis of NR was 41.4% concordant with the SR astigmatic axis, whereas HRK-8000 was 90.8% concordant. The 95% limits of agreement range of spherical, cylindrical, and spherical equivalent of refractive powers for SR were +2.01∼-2.72 D, +1.69∼-2.20 D, and +1.89∼-2.81 D in NR, +0.84∼-0.96 D, +0.42∼-0.73 D, and +0.81∼ -1.09 D in HRK-8000. Therefore, the range of agreement of NR was wider than that of HRK in all variables, resulting in low accuracy.
Conclusion : In light of the findings mentioned above, it is judged that NR will be difficult to replace the existing automatic refractometer, and it is believed that accuracy needs to be improved in order to be used as a preliminary test in clinical practice.",이법,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103854253
스마일수술과 펨토초라식수술 후 안구건조증 지표의 단기 관찰,"Purpose: To determine possible differences in dry eye syndrome in relation to surgery methods, especially between small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK), in Korean patients.
Methods: This study involved 20 patients (20 eyes) who were treated with SMILE surgery and 23 patients (23 eyes) who were treated with FS-LASIK. The Schirmer test, tear film breakup time (TBUT), corneal staining score (CSS), and measurement of changes in the lipid layer thicknesses at one week, and 1 and 3 months after surgery were performed. Possible correlations between indicators of dry eye syndrome were then analyzed.
Results: There was a significant time difference in some indices. The TBUT was 5.52 ± 1.50 s after one week for SMILE patients and 4.59 ± 2.50 s for FS-LASIK patients (p = 0.02). The CSS was 0.50 ± 0.51 after 1 week for SMILE patients and 1.14 ± 0.99 after 1 week for FS-LASIK patients (p = 0.04). The CSS was 0.50 ± 0.51 after 1 month for SMILE patients and 1.10 ± 0.93 after 1 month for FS-LASIK patients (p = 0.03). Three months later, the CSS was 0.39 ± 0.50 for SMILE patients and 0.94 ± 0.85 for FS-LASIK patients (p = 0.03). However, the Schirmer test did not show a significant difference postoperatively for SMILE and FS-LASIK patients at 1 week (p = 0.44), 1 month (p = 0.68), and 3 months (p = 0.23). Additionally, the thickness of the tear film lipid layer did not show a significant difference during the same periods (p = 0.36, p = 0.43, and p = 0.72, respectively).
Conclusions: When compared with FS-LASIK surgery, SMILE surgery resulted in significantly improved test results in the TBUT and CSS for dry eye syndrome.",정호길,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107775143
염증성 건성안 감별진단을 위한 검사법,"Purpose: To propose an algorithm for screening of inflammatory dry eye using tear tests, corneal staining and conjunctival hyperemiaMethods: A total of 81 patients in 20-30s without ophthalmologic diseases participated. The inflammatory dry eyes were diagnosed using MMP-9 (metalloproteinase-9) test and performed Shirmer test, TBUT (tear break-up time), corneal staining and conjunctival hyperemia. Dry eye refers to the criteria which specifies the OSDI (ocular surface disease index) score of more than 12, TBUT (tear film break-up time) of less 5 seconds, Schirmer test without anesthesia of less than 5mm/5minutes, corneal staining, and conjunctival hyperemia more than grade 1. Chi-square test was used to find out the correlation between tear/ocular surface test and MMP-9 test, and ROC curve was used for the sensitivity, specificity and AUC (area under the curve) for the algorithm of inflammatory dry eye.
Results: Neither of the methods, Schirmer test nor TBUT, showed statistically significant correlation with positive MMP-9 results(p>0.050). And, OSDI, corneal staining, and conjunctival hyperemia were significantly correlated with MMP-9 result(p<0.050). Among the OSDI scores, corneal staining, and conjunctival hyperemia, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC for screening of inflammatory dry eye were as follows. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of ‘OSDI/corneal staining/conjunctival hyperemia’ were 44.00%, 100.00%, 0.720, and ‘OSDI/corneal staining’ were 44.00% 94.59%, 0.693, ‘OSDI/conjunctival hyperemia’ were 76.80%, 75.68%, 0.762, and ‘corneal staining/conjunctival hyperemia were 52.80% 97.30%, 0.750, respectively, showing that ‘OSDI/conjunctival hyperemia’ was highest accuracy.
Conclusion: The algorithm of ‘OSDI/conjunctival hyperemia’ showed high accuracy similar to MMP-9 test. It would be a useful method for screening inflammatory dry eye.",박민혜,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108161391
난치성 포도막염에서 아달리무맙 치료 효과,"Purpose: To assess the efficacy and safety of Adalimumab (Humira®, AbbVie, Chicago, IL, USA) for repeated refractory uveitis during systemic steroid or immunosuppressive therapy.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical records on 30 eyes of 18 patients with non-infectious refractory uveitis who underwent Adalimumab injection therapy from December 2017 to July 2019. The therapeutic effect was assessed based on intraocular inflammation grade, central macular thickness, and best corrected visual acuity, and the efficacy was assessed based on control of inflammation and macular edema, as well as corticosteroid sparing effects. The safety was assessed based on adverse events.
Results: The mean duration of uveitis at baseline was 55.4 months (13-121 months) and the mean follow-up was 9.2 months (6-18 months). All 30 eyes of 18 patients stopped using systemic steroids and maintained clinical quiescence. Anterior chamber inflammation, vitreous inflammation, and best corrected visual acuity showed significant improvement, and there was no difference in central macular thickness. Uveitis recurred in 5 eyes, but 4 eyes showed controlled inflammation after single posterior sub-tenon steroid injection. One eye was controlled after methotrexate co-administration. Ulticaria (two patients) and injection- site reaction (one patient) were reported as adverse events.
Conclusions: Adalimumab is an effective treatment for decreasing inflammatory activity and reducing corticosteroid burden in refractory uveitis.",이상협,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106259065
일차 열공망막박리 환자에서 맥락막두께에 대한 분석,"Purpose: We analyzed the choroidal thickness in the subfoveal area and area of retinal detachment (RD) in monocular primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) patients and compared the RD eye with the fellow eye.
Methods: We retrospectively analyzed, optical coherence tomography data of both eyes at the first visit in patients who underwent surgery for monocular RRD from January 2013 to December 2016. Choroidal thickness was examined manually in the subfoveal and RD areas by two independent ophthalmologists; subjects without data from at least one of the two investigators were excluded.
Results: Ninety-five subjects were included in this study. Of the 95 RD eyes, 61 (64.2%) and 44 (46.3%) eyes showed macula and fovea invasion, respectively. The subfoveal choroidal thickness was statistically significant in the RD eye compared with the fellow eye (244.7 ± 79.0 μm vs. 220.1 ± 78.9 μm; p < 0.001). Moreover, the choroidal thickness of the RD area in the RD eye was thicker compared with the non-detachment area and corresponding area in the fellow eye (273.8 ± 53.4 μm vs. 215.2 ± 44.0 μm and 233.3 ± 56.7 μm, respectively; p < 0.001).

메칠글라이옥살이 섬유주세포의 산화스트레스에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: To investigate the effect of methylglyoxal (MG), intermediate metabolite of advanced glycation end products(AGE), on
the induction of oxidative stress in human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMC).
Methods: Primarily cultured HTMC were exposed to at concentrations of 0, 30, 100, and 300 μM of MG for 18 hours, with or
without co-exposure to N-acetyl-cysteine. Cellular survival and apoptosis were assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry
using annexin-PI double staining. Production of nitric oxide (NO), superoxide, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed
by Griess assay, cytochrome c assay, and dichlorofluorescein diacetate assay, respectively.
Results: MG did not affect cellular survival at concentrations under 100 μM, but induced apoptosis of HTMC at concentrations
over 100 μM. MG decreased NO production, accompanied with increased superoxide production. In addition, MG increased ROS,
which were abolished by N-acetylcysteine.
Conclusions: MG induced oxidative stress by decreasing NO production, accompanied by increasing superoxide and ROS
productions in HTMC. AGE could induce trabecular meshwork dysfunction.",이승희,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105772552
건성안과 비건성안에 인공눈물과 습윤액 점안시시간경과에 따른 눈물막 안정성에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: This study investigated the public knowledge regarding the proper use of eye drops such as artificial tears and conditioning solution. In addition, study explored the short term effect of eye drops over time on tear film stability.
Methods: Firstly, online survey was created to ask experience of eye drop use and knowledge regarding proper use. Secondly 20 participants were recruited and participants were divided into group into dry eye group and normal eye group based on OSDI (Ocular Surface Disease Index) survey score (10 for dry eye group, 10 for normal eye group). 3 eye drops (artificial tears (AT), conditioning solution (CS) and saline solution (SS)) were applied to each participants. Tear film stability factors such as TMH and Non-invasive TBUT were measured at baseline, 1 min, 3 min and 5 min after instillation.
Results: All 127 response of online survey collected, 66.7% (n=82) of respondents not sure regarding the difference between artificial tears and conditioning solution. 68.1% (n=47) of contact lens wearers have used artificial tears while wearing CL. Regarding the effect of eye drops over time on TMH, there was significant difference over time of eye drop (Baseline<1 min and 3 min, p<0.050). However there was no difference between baseline and 5 min after(p=0.720) for TBUT measurement. There was significant difference with types of eye drop (SS<AT, CS p<0.050) and over time (baseline, 5 min after <1 min after p<0.050)Conclusion: As public awareness regarding proper use of eye drops, it is very important to deliver proper instruction to the public. Effect to TMH with eye drops may not last more than 5 min, so temporary improvement. For TBUT, effect of AT on TBUT was greater at 1 min than other eye drops for dry eye group. Instillation of saline solution may worse the tear film stability, in particular TBUT.",정예린,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105544730
높은 망막색소상피박리를 동반한 삼출성 황반변성에서 안내주사 후 망막색소상피파열의 예측인자,"Purpose: To evaluate the risk factors for retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) tear after intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment in patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration, associated with high pigment epithelial detachment (PED) (>400 μm).
Methods: Fifty-five treatment-naive patients with high PED (>400 μm) and exudative age-related macular degeneration, treated with an initial series of 3 monthly loading injections between January 2013 and December 2017, were retrospectively included.
Results: The RPE tear rate was 16.4% (9/55). The areas affected by choroidal neovascularization and PED were significantly larger in the tear group compared with the no-tear group (p = 0.004, p = 0.029, respectively). The rate of intraretinal fluid (IRF) was 89% and 28% in the tear and no-tear groups, respectively (p = 0.001), and the subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in the tear group (p = 0.003). There was no significant difference with respect to age, sex, laterality, underlying disease, baseline visual acuity, diagnosis, type of PED, or presence of subretinal fluid between the tear and no-tear groups.
According to logistic regression analysis findings, the presence of IRF is associated with a higher risk of RPE tear (odds ratio = 20.3, p = 0.007).
Conclusions: The presence of IRF was associated with RPE tear development after intravitreal injection for exudative age-related macular degeneration.",양희정,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108128302
심층 학습을 이용한 삼출성 나이관련황반변성 환자의 치료 12개월 후 시력 악화 예측,"Purpose: To develop a deep learning model to predict visual acuity (VA) outcomes after 12 months of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment.
Methods: A total of 330 treatment-naive eyes of neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients, who underwent anti- VEGF therapy between 2007 and 2020 at Konkuk University medical center, were included. The network was trained using VA at baseline, VA after three loading doses of anti-VEGF, and treatment regimen data. It was also trained using 12,300 augmented optical coherence tomography (OCT) B-scan images at baseline and after three loading doses of anti-VEGF. We generated five deep learning models using sequentially input data (VA and OCT B-scan images at baseline and after three loading doses, and treatment regimen). Prediction of VA at 12 months was performed using deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural network and multilayer perceptron. The outcomes were dichotomized based on whether the decremental change in VA during the 12 months of treatment was more or less than logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 0.3. Predictive efficiency was assessed by comparing the performance of deep learning models.
Results: The best performing model was trained using input data, including VA at baseline and after three loading doses, treatment regimen, and OCT B-scan images at baseline and after three loading doses. The decremental outcome in VA after 12 months of anti-VEGF treatment was predicted as an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79. The addition of OCT images at baseline and after three loading doses as input data improved the AUC, sensitivity, and negative predictive value (AUC 0.74-0.79, 0.58-0.86, and 0.90-0.95, respectively).

배경 색상에 따른 시인성과 영향 요인 평가,"Purpose : This study aimed to assess the visibility of golf balls of different colors in a setting with different background colors and to examine at how visibility effected according on the correction condition.
Methods : Participants included 25 visually normal without ophthalmic diseases or visual impairments (13 men and 12 women, with an average age of 24.72±1.81 years). The test conditions were divided into three categories: background (grass and sand), correction (full correction, +0.50 D fogging, +1.00 D fogging), golf-only lens wearing and not wearing. Under each condition, balls of blue (B), orange (O), fluorescent (F), and white (W) were randomly placed, and the minimum distance the ball was recognized was measured by a gold distance meter. In addition, subjective visibility was evaluated.
Results : As a result of measurement on grass, W: 92.72±13.07, O: 98.12±3.21, B: 65.76± 11.47, and F: 97.96±4.96 m (p<0.010), and as a result of measurement on sand, W: 66.80±7.87, O: 85.72±9.67, B: 86.84±7.86, F: 86.08±6.64 m (p<0.010). The minimal perceptual distance increased with increasing amount of fogging in both grass and sand (p<0.010). The minimum perceptual distance in all colors was further distant when the result of adding the +1.00 D fogging state and the golf-only lens was W: 68±13.37, O: 78.12±10.89, B: 38.28±7.88, and F: 81.52±10.39 m (p<0.010). Fluorescent had the most visibility in the subjective visibility evaluation on grass, while blue had the lowest visibility, while blue had the highest visibility in sand and white had the lowest (p<0.050).
Conclusion : As a result of this study, there was a difference in the minimum perceptual distance of the object according to the background color, and there was a significant difference in the minimum perceptual distance for each color in the same background. As the degree of myopia low correction increased, the minimum perceptual distance for both sand and grass was shortened, and green tinted lenses were found to have a positive effect on improving visibility on grass.",정지수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100524422
