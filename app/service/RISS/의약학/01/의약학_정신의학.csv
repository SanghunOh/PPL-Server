
불안장애 환자를 대상으로 한 한국판 상태불안척도의 요인분석,"Objective : Brief screening for anxiety symptoms in clinical practice can further facilitate the diagnosis and evaluation of anxiety disorders. This study examined the factorial validity of the Korean version of the State-Trait Inventory (STAI)-Form X, one of the most frequently used self-report questionnaires for anxiety. Methods : Data from the STAI and Beck Depression Inventory were obtained from a consecutive sample of 200 outpatients diagnosed with DSM-IV anxiety disorders at a psychiatric unit of a university hospital. The factor structures of the State and Trait Scales were assessed using exploratory factor analysis. Results : Three-factor components, including 'State anxiety present', 'State anxiety absent' and 'Selfconfidence', were extracted from the State Scale, explaining 59% of the total variance. A four-factor solution involving 'Trait anxiety and depression present', 'Trait anxiety and depression absent', 'Anxiety proneness' and 'Stability' (59% of total variance) was extracted from the Trait Scale. The internal consistency of the STAI and factors were satisfactory. There were significant correlations between depressive symptoms and factors of the STAI. Conclusion : The STAI-form X showed factorial validity for Korean patients with anxiety disorders. However, our finding that this anxiety scale also measures depressive symptoms should be interpreted with caution.",이건석,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2011097
주의력결핍/과잉운동 장애(ADHD) 남자 아동들에서 Methylphenidate 치료 전후에 Tc-99m ECD SPECT로 측정된 국소 뇌혈류 이상과 인지적 특성변화와의 연관관계,"Objective The purpose of this study was to examine the regional cerebral blood-flow (CBF) difference between boys with pure ACHD and normal controls before and after methylphenidate treatment, and also we examined the association between rCBF changes and cognitive characteristics of boys with pure ADHD before and after methylphenidate treatment.
Methods The rCBF of 5 boys with pure AOHD and 5 control boys were examined by Tc-99m ECD brain SFECT and cognitive characteristics by ADS and every 5 ADHD boys took MPH for 12 to 16 weeks After that all ADHD boys took Tc-99m ECD brain SPECT and checked ADS again rCBF difference and changes before and after MPH treatment were quantified and analyzed by using SPM And associations between types of cognitive changes measured by ADS and rCBF changes were examined and quantitative associations between them were also analyzed by using Pearson's coefficient correlation.
Results 1) Before MPH treatment, rCBF of ADHD boys were significantly decreased in left orbitofrontal area and left caudate nucleus compared to normal controls 2) After MPH treatment. rCBF of the same regions were significantly increased. 3) There was positive correlation between the degree of commission error(impulsivity disinhibition) among the ADS variables and the degree of blood-flow decrease in above two areas before MPH treatment but after MPH treatment, only with the degree of rC3F increase in Lt orbitofrontal area.
Conclusion : These results suggest that the pathophysiology of impulsivity of disinhibition of the characteristic symploms of AOHD boys IS associated with hypoactivties of left orbibfrontal area and left caudate nucleus, and MPH pharmacodynamics in ADHD boys is associated to their actions on these two areas.",오은영,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3002146

"청소년기 뇌 발달과 인지, 행동 특성","Adolescence is a period of physical, cognitive, and social development between childhood and adulthood. Neuroimaging studies indicate that dynamic changes, both structural and functional, occur in the adolescent brain. Such adolescence-associated alterations in the brain likely promote the development of the cognitive competencies and social relationships necessary for effective adult functioning. The thesis of this review is that developmental changes in the brain contribute to the age-specific cognitive and behavioral characteristics of adolescence. Based on findings from neuroscience, we describe pubertal hormone changes at the beginning of adolescence, the activation-organization theory of brain development, cognitive development, risk-taking behavior and social behavior during adolescence. We also discuss how pubertal hormones alter brain function and, thereby, cognition and behavior.",박재홍(Jae Hong Park),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100664477
한국형 우울장애 약물치료 알고리듬 (Ⅳ),"Objectives : In 2002, the Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Major depressive Disorder (KMAP-MD) was published, but there has been a need for a guideline about detailed issues of depressive disorder. We revised KMAP-MDD andreestablished Korean Medication Algorithm Project for Depressive Disorder (KMAP-DD) in 2006.
Methods : A questionnaire had been developed by the executive committee for KMAP-DD. The review committee consisted of 101 experienced psychiatrists. From the total of 22 questions in the questionnaire, 7 questions were evaluated for these subjects . We classified the expert opinions to 3 categories according to its confidence interval; first, second and third line.
Results : SSRI and venlafaxine were the first line antidepressants (AD) for atypical and melancholic depression. For dysthymic disorder and minor depressive disorder, SSRI was recommended as the first line medications. Only AD medications was a preferred initial strategy for treating premenstrual dysphoric disorder, mild to moderate and severe non-psychotic postpartum depression. In severe psychotic postpartum depression, combination therapy of AD and atypical antipsychotics was the treatment of choice. SSRI was preferred when considering sedation, anticholinergic and cardiovascular adverse effects. Also, experts recommended mirtazapine against gastrointestinal adverse effects and bupropion in avoiding sexual dysfunction.
Conclusion : These results suggest that clinicians have to consider both clinical situations and drug adverse effects in the choice of antidepressant medications.",전현태,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101693570
‘2019 한국형 조현병 약물치료 지침서’에 따른 조현병에서 동반증상 및 부작용의 치료,"Objectives: The current study covers a secondary revision of the guidelines for the pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia issued by the Korean Medication Algorithm for Schizophrenia (KMAP-SCZ) 2001, specifically for co-existing symptoms and antipsychotics-related side-effects in schizophrenia patients. Methods: An expert consensus regarding the strategies of pharmacotherapy for positive symptoms of schizophrenia, co-existing symptoms of schizophrenia, and side-effect of antipsychotics in patients with schizophrenia was retrieved by responses obtained using a 30-item questionnaire. Results: For the co-existing symptoms, agitation could be treated with oral or intramuscular injection of benzodiazepine or antipsychotics; depressive symptoms with atypical antipsychotics and adjunctive use of antidepressant; obsessive-compulsive symptoms with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and antipsychotics other than clozapine and olanzapine; negative symptoms with atypical antipsychotics or antidepressants; higher risk of suicide with clozapine; comorbid substance abuse with use of naltrexone or bupropion/varenicline, respectively. For the antipsychotics-related side effects, anticholinergics (extrapyramidal symptom), propranolol and benzodiazepine (akathisia), topiramate or metformin (weight gain), change of antipsychotics to aripiprazole (hyperprolactinemia and prolonged QTc) or clozapine (tardive dyskinesia) could be used. Conclusion: Updated pharmacotherapy strategies for co-existing symptoms and antipsychotics-related side effects in schizophrenia patients as presented in KMAP-SCZ 2019 could help effective clinical decision making of psychiatrists as a preferable option.",윤제연,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A1996655
노인 우울증에 영향을 미치는 요인들에 대한 연구,"Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the related factors of elderly depression among Korean adults aged 60 years and above. Methods: From the database of Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2018, data of 2,288 adults over age 60 who responded to the questionnaires of health interview were included in this study. We analyzed the data using logistic regression analysis. Results: According to our results, the number of chronic diseases seemed to be associated with depression in elderly people, especially when they have more than 4 chronic diseases. Poorer self-rated health was identified as a significant factor and the odd ratio was the highest among all independent variables in our study. Walking over 10 minutes more than 4 times a week was considered as a protective factor for elderly depression. The association between education level and depression was inconsistent. Variables such as female gender, single status, smoking showed statistically insignificant results. Older age itself was not identified as a risk factor as odd ratios of all groups (over age 65) compared to reference group (age 60-64) were below 1. Conclusion: This study confirms several related factors for elderly depression. Having more than 4 chronic diseases, poorer self-rated health were identified as a significant risk factor for depression. Regular walking was considered as a protective factor for elderly depression. The knowledge of these factors might help to manage risks of elderly depression and devise early intervention approaches.",김용(Yong Kim),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3009176

코로나19이후 사회 경제적 변화와 청소년 정신건강의 연관성,"Objectives：The purpose of this study is to investigate depression and suicide ideation according to socioeconomic changes after COVID-19 among Korean adolescent.
Methods：Data on the study population were obtained from the 16th Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey (KYRBS). The KYRBS is a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents (aged 12-18 years) that originally included over 103 questions in 15 domains of health-risk behaviors. In the 16th KYRBS, a total 54,948 students from 793 schools responded to the survey. Chi-square test and logistic regression analysis were conducted regarding depression and suicide ideation.
Results：This study suggests that changes in the family household before and after COVID-19 pandemic are also affecting the mental health of the adolescents. The study shows that worse change of family household is significant associations with suicidal ideation and depression. Adolescents reporting worse (AOR 1.38; 95% CI 1.38-1.57) and much worse (AOR 2.07; 95% CI 1.87-2.29) were significantly more likely to report depression. Adolescents reporting worse (AOR 1.34; 95% CI 1.34-1.60) and much worse (AOR 2.01; 95% CI 1.76-2.29) were significantly more likely to report suicide ideation.
Conclusions：In this study, it was confirmed that young people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds are at high risk of suicide ideation and more depression. The results of this study suggest that we should consider improving the screening and prevention of mental health problems for adolescents with poor socioeconomic changes of COVID-19.",김희주,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100815145

"교대근무간호사의 교대근무병 증상에 따른 수면, 지각된 건강 및 직무스트레스 비교","Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of symptoms of shift work disorder (SSWD) and its related factors in rapidly rotating three-shift nurses. Methods: We enrolled 344 nurses (mean age, 28.7 years) without prior history of sleep disturbance before starting shift work in a university-affiliated hospital. SSWD were defined using self-reported sleep questionnaires (insomnia severity index >14 and/or Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≥10) and without any sleep problem before shift work. Sleep pattern in each of the three shifts was measured using the Munich Chronotype Questionnaire for Shift-Workers. Mood (anxiety, depression) and job stress were also measured using self-reported questionnaires. Results: Our results showed that 62.2% of the participants presented SSWD. Compared to the non-SWD group, the SSWD group showed worse sleep hygiene, lower total sleep time (TST) during workdays, higher anxiety and depressive mood, and higher job stress. In the SSWD group, the evening chronotype individuals presented the shortest TST during day shifts, while the morning chronotype individuals presented the shortest TST during evening shifts. Conclusions: SSWD is highly prevalent in fast rotating three-shift nurses. This study suggests that intensive education on sleep hygiene and appropriate scheduling of shift work while considering individual chronotypes may improve sleep patterns and sleep quality of shift workers and minimize SSWD.",최수정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40028121

절망감 우울증,"Although hopelessness is a common mood in depressive disorders, the significance of hopelessness in depression has not been well appreciated. This paper reviewed the development and progress of the theory of hopelessness depression. Abramson et al. proposed hopelessness depression as a subtype of depression, distinguished by the specific explanatory style for stressful negative life events. The pathogenesis of hopelessness depression was explained by the trait-stress model, in which stressful negative life events activated a underlying trait, i.e. a specific depressogenic explanatory style. Although it is not well substantiated yet whether hopelessness depression is a meaningful subtype of depression or not, the theory of hopelessness depression is intriguing and stimulating not only in understanding the cognitive aspect of depression but also in maintaining positive emotion in general. Further study is in need to verify hopelessness depression as a clinically meaningful subtype of depression.",박영남,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A1996956
한국 청소년의 우울증상과 부모자녀관계,"Objectives：The objective of this study was to compare the parent-child relationship of adolescents with depression and those without depression, by using Parent-Child Relationship Instrument (PCRI), Family Relationship Scale (FRS), and Parenting Attitude Test-Youth (PAT-Y). We also investigated the association between the parent-child relationship and depressive symptoms.
Methods：Twenty-five adolescents with depression (age 15.0±2.1 years, 8 boys) and 24 adolescents without depression (age 13.7±1.3 years, 16 boys) completed the Adolescent-General Behavior Inventory (A-GBI), Adolescent-Mood Disorder Questionnaire (A-MDQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), PCRI, and PAT-Y. The parents of subjects completed the Child Behavior Checklist, Parent-General Behavior Inventory 10-item Mania Scale (P-GBI-10M), Parent-Mood Disorder Questionnaire, and FRS. Independent t-tests, analysis of covariance, and partial correlation analysis were used.
Results：The Intimacy (p=.002) and Respect (p=.029) scores of the PCRI were significantly higher in adolescents without depression compared to those with depression. The Intimacy scores of the PCRI showed negative correlation with the BDI and P-GBI-10M and the Strictness scores of the PCRI showed positive correlation with the A-GBI, A-MDQ, and BDI. The Inconsistency, Punishment, and Excessive Expectation scores of the PAT-Y showed positive correlation with the A-GBI and BDI scores.

조기 발병 조현병과 후기 발병 조현병의 임상 양상에 대한 비교 연구,"Objectives: Late-onset schizophrenia (LOS, age at first onset ≥40 years) is characterized by including predominance of women, better premorbid social adjustment and lower severity of positive/negative symptoms. However, few studies have been conducted on LOS, especially in Asian countries. This study aimed to examine the clinical features of LOS in comparison with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS). Methods: By retrospectively reviewing medical records, we assessed demographic data and clinical features of 76 LOS (20 males) and 357 EOS (144 males) who admitted to the psychiatric ward of a general hospital. Results: The mean ages of onset were 47.3±5.1 (LOS) and 25.7±6.5 (EOS) years. There were significantly more women in LOS (73.7%) than EOS (59.6%). Significantly more LOS patients had a marital (88.2% vs. 25.8%) and employment history (28.9% vs. 13.1%) than EOS. Patients with LOS had fewer negative (14.3±9.0 vs. 19.9±9.3), general psychopathology score (36.9±11.1 vs. 42.3±13.9) than EOS patients. Conclusion: In line with previous studies, this study demonstrated that LOS patients have better premorbid social adjustment. Our finding also replicates previous findings that LOS patients differ from EOS in predominance of women and relative lack of negative symptoms. These results suggest that LOS may be a distinct subtype of schizophrenia.",고미애,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108609055

수면 부족과 과도한 주간졸림증의 관련성,"Objectives：Sleep loss and excessive daytime sleepiness may have serious consequences, including traffic and industrial accidents, decreased productivity, learning disabilities and interpersonal problems. Yet despite these adverse effects, there are few epidemiological studies on sleep loss and daytime sleepiness in the general population of Korea. This study investigates the number of people who suffer from sleep insufficiency, how much recovery sleep occurs on weekends, and the relationship between the amount of recovery sleep and daytime sleepiness. Methods：A total 164 volunteers, aged 20 and over, were recruited by advertisement. The subjects were workers and college students living in Seoul, Korea. Subjects were excluded if they were aged over 60；if they had medical, neurological, psychiatric or sleep disorders that could cause insomnia or daytime sleepiness；if they were not following a regular sleep schedule；if they traveled abroad during the study；or if they did not leave home to work or were shift workers. They were interviewed and given a sleep log to complete on each of 14 consecutive mornings. They also completed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) at noontime on the last day of the second week. All statistical data were analyzed by t-test, $X^2$-test or ANOVA, using SPSS/PC+. Results：The results showed that the subjects woke up at 6：50 (${\pm}1$：16) on weekdays, 7：09 (${\pm}1$：29) on Saturdays, and 8：12 (${\pm}1$：39) on Sundays and holidays. They took more frequent and longer naps on Sundays than on weekdays and Saturdays. The mean sleep duration was 6h 35 min. on week nights, with a mean increase of about 1h on weekends. Only 9.1% of the subjects spent more than 8h in bed on week nights, with 67% spending less than 7h, and 49.4% reported recovery sleep of more than 1h on Sundays. The subjects who reported recovery sleep of more than 2h on Sundays, showed significantly more excessive daytime sleepiness than those who reported less than 30 min (F=2.62, p<.05). Conclusions：These findings suggest that sleep insufficiency and excessive daytime sleepiness are relatively common in Korea, and that the people who get insufficient sleep on weekdays try to compensate for sleep loss with oversleeping and daytime napping on Sundays and holidays. It appeared that daily sleep insufficiency had a cumulative effect and increased daytime sleepiness.",최윤경,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3009099
성격의 6요인(HEXACO) 모형에 의한 우울 및 불안장애 환자 성격 특성과 우울 및 불안 증상 간의 관계,"Objective : This study used the HEXACO personality structure model to evaluate the relationship between personality profiles and symptoms in patients with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Methods : Total 123 patients with depression or anxiety disorders completed Beck depression inventory (BDI), state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI), and HEXACO-personality inventory. Correlation analysis and independent t-test were performed for comparison between HEXACO and BDI or STAI scores. Results : Depressive symptoms were negatively correlated with extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness to experiences. Both severity of state and trait anxiety were positively correlated with emotionality, and negatively correlated with conscientiousness and agreeableness. Moreover, state anxiety was negatively correlated with honesty-humility, and trait anxiety was negatively correlated with extraversion. The depression group showed significantly higher emotionality and lower extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experiences, and agreeableness compared to the non-depression group. In a comparison of the HEXACO domain scores between the non-anxiety and anxiety group, honesty-humility and agreeableness in the state anxiety group and extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness in trait anxiety group were significantly lower. Conclusion : Theses results suggest that the depression or anxiety symptoms were highly correlated with personality profiles. Therefore, evaluating the personality profiles in these patients may be helpful for directing appropriate therapeutic plans.",김소연,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106411131

한국어판 강점ㆍ난점 설문지(Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) 개발,"Objectives : This study aims to develop a Korean version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Kr).
Methods : The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire that can be completed by the parents within 5 minutes and used to assess the psychopathology (prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity, emotional problems, conduct problems, and peer problems) of 4-16 year olds. The SDQ was translated into Korean, retranslated back to English, and corrected after discussion with the original developer and trial test. The reliability and validity of the SDQ-Kr was evaluated by working with 347 parents of nonclinical (n=98), pediatric outpatient (n=92), and psychiatric outpatient (n=157) children.
Results : Working with 62 parents of nonclinical children, the test-retest reliability of 5 subscales of SDQ-Kr was 0.94-0.84(p<0.01). For 190 nonclinical and pediatric children, internal consistency of 5 subscales of SDQ-Kr was 0.80-0.50 (Cronbach's α). Factor analysis generated the five identical factors with the five subscales explaining 49.5% of total variance. For 347 children of nonclinical, pediatric, and psychiatric group, ANOVA showed that any two among the three groups was significantly different in subscales and total difficulties scores, except between pediatric and psychiatric children in emotional problems subscore (p<0.01). The discriminating rate among three groups was 75.5% in discriminant analysis.
Conclusions : The Korean version of SDQ shows very similar psychometric performance to the original SDQ developed by Goodman. This study gives evidence of the usefulness of the SDQ-Kr as a promising screening instrument for epidemiological research and clinical purposes.",안정숙,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106584960
구조화된 음악 치료 프로그램이 치매 노인의 정서 기능에 미치는 영향에 대한 후향적 분석,"Objective: The effectiveness of music therapy programs for the elderly with dementia has been verified through several studies, but there is a limitation in that most of them are compared with a single group, no treatment group or waiting group. In this study, to overcome this problem, the two groups that performed similar interventions were selected and compared retrospectively. Methods: For 37 people who participated in the treatment programs for the elderly with dementia at Dongdaemun Center for Dementia and its branch center, we retrospectively analyzed the changes in Korean version of Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Quality of Life Scale-Dementia scores measured before and after treatment. Results: Prior to treatment, there is no significant difference between the groups in the demographic variables and the depression and quality of life scores. The difference between pre- and post-scores was not significant in the group at the branch center without a music therapy, but depression was significantly reduced and quality of life had improved in the group at Dongdaemun center with the music therapy program. Conclusion: It was confirmed that participation in the structured music therapy program had a positive effect on the improvement of depression and quality of life in the elderly with dementia compared to other similar interventions.",전소정(So Jeong Jeon),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106584963

Methods : A total of 429 outpatients diagnosed with depression and/or anxiety disorders surveyed with questionnaires measuring socio-demographic, clinical, and positive psychological factors. The relationships of trait anxiety with clinical symptoms and positive psychological factors were evaluated. Results : Patients with low trait anxiety showed high optimism, gratitude, hope, spirituality and purpose in life. After adjusting age, scores of BDI and STAI-S, the results showed low trait anxiety was associated with high spirituality and purpose in life. Conclusion : The result revealed that trait anxiety had negative-relationship with spirituality and purpose in life in patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders. Although trait anxiety was known as a general tendency which is stable, approach to trait anxiety by modulating these associated positive psychological factors would be newer approach of treatment to patients with depressive and/or anxiety disorders.",안희영,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108183020

This study was undertaken as one of a series of researches on shift workers and sleep. The purpose was to understand the sleep pattern and to offer basic data in order to improve a sleep regimen. The sleep log was administered to a relatively homogenous group of 38 psychiatric nurses who were on the two-daily phase delay(day/evening/night) rotating shift schedule. Some possible influencing factors to sleep pattern(age, sex, marital status, work duration, drug use, and physical and psychiatric diseases including sleep disorders) were controlled. The sleep measures were main sleep(starting time, latency, number of awakenings, length and subjective quality). Each measure was analyzed and compared accross the rest times at which the workers can take sleep and nap. Also, the possible relationships between the main sleep(quality and length) and naps(number and length) were analyzed.
The following results are based on the data of 33 of the 38 subjects. Five of the subjects who did not sleep during the rest time after the second night shift were classified seperately.
1) The beginning of the main sleep phase was delayed during the rest times after day, evening, and night shift, while advanced during the rest times after days off.
2) The sleep measures were significantly different across the rest times; for latency(F(7.224)=2.12, p〈.05), quality(F(7.224)=8.97, P〈.001), length(F(7.224)=41.13, p〈.001) of main sleep, and number of nap(F(7.224)=19.27, P〈.001) and length of nap(F(7.224)=12.79, P〈.001). The main sleep taken in the day time after night shift was generally poorer quality and shorter length than that in the night time after day and evening shifts and days off. Nap was relatively longer and more frequent during the rest time after night shifts than during the rest time after day and evening shifts and days off.
3) There were significantly negative relationships between the total length of main sleep and total number of nap(r= -.3632, p〈.001) and between the total length of main sleep and total length of nap(r= -.2253, P〈.001) across the rest times.",이형영,1991,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639972
폭력 관련 범죄력이 있는 조현병 환자의 인지행동치료에 관한 환자 대조군 연구,"Objectives : Despite remarkable development of pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia, some patients continuously have had violence problems. The violence of psychotic patients is recently becoming the focus of the attention. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) on patients with schizophrenia having violence related history.
Methods : 15 Patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder of crime history were treated with individual CBT for 12 sessions, and assessed with 4 scales (Korean version of Aggression Questionnaire, Korean version of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11-Revised, Beck Cognitive Insight Scale and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) to evaluate anger, impulse, insight and clinical symptoms respectively at baseline and post treatment. The comparison group consisted of 15 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder of crime history. They were also assessed with the same scales during the same period.
Results : Although impulsivity is not changed significantly after treatment, but there was significant improvement in clinical symptom, insight and aggression, especially self-reflectiveness and anger respectively.
Conclusion : CBT can be one of the good therapeutic tools for patients with schizophrenia having violence problems in that it reduces aggression and enhances insight of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder.",김원영,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101693465
"도시 지역 지역사회 거주 노인의 독거, 사회적 고립, 그리고 우울장애","Objective：This study was conducted to estimate prevalence of depressive disorder and its association with living alone and social isolation in an urban community in Seoul.
Methods：A total of 704 adults who is not relying on long term care services and with age over 65 years were recruited from an urban community in Seoul. Subjects were evaluated by Korean version of Geriatric Depression Scale, short form, Mini Mental Status Examination, in the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease assessment battery, Korean version of Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty and Eye Opener questionnaire, and Korean version of Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Inventory. Prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation, according to living-alone status were obtained, and risk factors affecting depression were evaluated.
Results：The prevalence for depressive disorder were 10.7% in overall, while prevalence for those not living alone 10.0% and for those living alone, 13.4%. From logistic regression models, the most important risk factor for depressive disorder was history of past mental health problems. Living alone failed to achieve significance as a risk factor of depressive disorder and social isolation predicted depressive disorder only when not accounting history of past mental health problems.
Conclusion：Intrinsic personal vulnerability represented by history of past mental health problems were more important risk factor of depressive disorder than current social situations including living alone or social isolations.",손지훈,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101693633
지역사회 노인에서의 수면의 질과 인지기능의 관련성에 대한 연구,"Objectives: Sleep disturbance in the elderly is associated with cognitive decline. Sleep quality is known to deteriorate with age, and prospective studies seldom have examined the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function. This study investigates the relationship between early sleep quality and cognitive function based on six-year follow-up data of communi- ty individuals older than 60 years.
Methods: The participants included 622 community elderly people older than 60 years from Jinju-Si. The final analysis com- prised 322 elderly people. Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and the Korean version of Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD-K) were used to assess early sleep quality and cognitive function after six years. Multiple lin- ear regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between early sleep quality and cognitive function in the elderly.
Results: Early sleep quality (PSQI) was significantly associated with the results of the digit span test, clock drawing test (clox 1), and word recall test after six years. Sleep quality (PSQI) decreased significantly after six years, and lower quality of sleep (PSQI) score was associated with higher digit span test score (β = -0.167, p = 0.026) and higher clock drawing test score (β = -0.157, p = 0.031). Lower quality of sleep (PSQI) score was associated with higher word recall test (β = -0.140, p = 0.039). Conclusion: The digit span test, word recall test, and clock drawing task (CLOX 1) shown to be significantly associated to sleep quality can be performed fast and easily in clinical practice. It is important to assess early cognitive function in the el- derly with poor sleep quality, and further studies could suggest that these tests may be useful screening tests for early de- mentia in elderly with poor sleep quality.",오윤균,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82570503
정신질환에 의한 기능장애,"Objectives : This study was conducted to explore the relationship between non-psychotic, common mental disorders and work loss days, using data from 2001 KECA survey.
Methods : Six thousands and two hundred seventy-five community dwelling subjects, aged 18 years or older, were interviewed by using the Korean version of Composite International Diagnostic Interview (K-CIDI). Common mental disorders during last 12 months were assessed by work loss days of past month with questions from the WHO Disablement Assessment Scale version 2 (WHODAS-II). Main analysis was done by Linear and Logistic regressions to identify the association between mental disorders and work loss days.
Results : As expected, mental disorders were associated with substantial work loss days. Subjects with major depression had highest work loss days. Many common anxiety disorders like social phobia, specific phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder were also associated with high work loss days.
Conclusion : Our results show that a number of common mental disorders might have substantial effect on job function, quality of life and, subsequently, social productivity. Therefore it seems that more attention for public mental health efforts is warranted.",손지훈,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106411132
놀이치료자의 자기효능감과 치료적 동맹의 관계에서 역전이 관리능력의 매개효과,"The purpose of this study was to examine the mediating effect of countertransference management ability on the relationship between self-efficacy and therapeutic alliance of play therapist. The subjects of this study were 204 play therapists who work in Seoul, Gyeonggi-do, Incheon-based child counseling centers, play therapy rooms in welfare centers, play therapy rooms in hospitals, and university-based play therapy rooms were used. The play therapists reponded to the survey on Counseling Self-Estimate Inventory(COSE), Countertransference Factors Inventory(CFI), Working Alliance Inventory(WAI). The collected data was analyzed using the Pearson's correlation analysis and the Baron and Kenny(1986) mediating effect analysis. Additionally, Sobel's(1982) test was used to verify the significance of the mediation effect. The results are as follows: First, self-efficacy was positively associated with countertransference management abilities and therapeutic alliances amongst play therapists. Second, the total score of countertransference management ability (self-integration, empathy ability, anxiety management) had a partially mediating effct on the relationship between play therapist's self-efficacy and therapeutic alliances. In conclusion, play therapist's higher self-efficacy and countertransference management abilities should be developed to improve their therapeutic alliances.",김예지,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108113747
중추신경흥분성 식욕억제제 사용의 부작용에 관한 신속 체계적 문헌고찰 : 의존 및 정신병 중심으로,"Objectives: Although psychostimulants for suppressing appetite have indications for a short-term use, long-term prescriptions are also frequently encountered in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to overview the empirical evidence on the safety of such psychostimulants. Methods ： A rapid systematic review was conducted using existing systematic review articles or clinical guidelines developed by adopting systematic review methodology. Results ： Four systematic review articles or clinical guidelines were reviewed. Studies on the safety of diethylpropion were all short-term. Six case reports reported psychotic symptoms. Phentermine, phendimetrazine, and diethylpropion have been withdrawn in most countries due to their side effects such as drug abuse and cardiotoxicity. Long-term prescription safety for phentermine or diethylpropion was not addressed in existing clinical guidelines for pharmacological management of adult obesity. Moreover, studies on the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in the childhood and adolescence obesity management have not been reported yet. Conclusion : The number of studies on the long-term safety of antiobesity psychostimulants prescriptions was too limited to conclude their efficacy and safety for long-term use. Thus, long-term prescriptions of antiobesity psychostimulants should be avoided and closer monitoring is needed even for short-term use of psychostimulants in subjects with mental health risk.",조선진(Sun-Jin Jo),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101880185
우울장애와 불안장애 환자들에서 자살관련 행동의 비교,"Objectives : By comparing the prevalence rates of suicide-related behaviors (suicide ideation, plan and attempt) between depressive disorder and anxiety disorder patients, we tried to find the characteristics of suicide-related behaviors in these patients. Methods : Four hundred-three patients participated in the study and the prevalence rates of suicide-related behaviors were investigated using Korean version of Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview plus. Pearson Chi-Square test was used to find the association between depressive or anxiety disorders and suiciderelated behaviors. Results : Statistically significant differences were found between depressive disorder group and anxiety disorder group in terms of suicide ideation ($X^2$=6.173, df=1, p=0.013) and suicide attempt ($X^2$=8.008, df=1, p=0.005). We also found that patients in depressive disorder group were more likely to have suicide ideation (Odds Ratio=2.049, 95% Confidence Interval=1.155-3.635), and attempt suicide (Odds Ratio=4.970, 95% Confidence Interval=1.466-16.845) than patients in anxiety disorder group. Conclusion : These findings suggest that suicide ideation and suicide attempt rates are higher in depressive disorders than in anxiety disorders.",신호철,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107791758
환각제의 부작용과 안전성 문제,"There is a growing interest in the medical use of psychedelics, also known as hallucinogenic drugs.

불안장애의 치료추구시간에 대한 공존 정신질환의 영향 : 사회불안장애와 공황장애 간 비교,"Objective : Individuals with anxiety disorders experience a wide range of time to seeking treatment (TST) as well as various comorbid mental disorders. The present study examined the TST in social anxiety disorder (SAD) and panic disorder. This study aimed to find out the influence of comorbid mental disorder on TST of anxiety disorder through the comparison of SAD and panic disorder. Methods : This study included 311 SAD and 378 panic disorder patients at the initial visit of psychiatric clinic. Contribution of clinical (number of comorbidity, comorbid type and onset age) and demographic (current age) factors to TST were investigated by multivariate analysis. Results : The median length of TST was 14.03 years in SAD and 2.26 years in panic disorder. In social anxiety disorder, fewer comorbidity, younger onset age, and older age were factors associated with delayed TST. In panic disorder, only younger onset age was associated with delayed TST. In both disorders, comorbid depressive disorder was associated with shorter TST. Conclusion : Our data provided the differences in illness behavior needing help based on comorbid mental disorders between SAD and panic disorder. In addition to comorbid disorder, factors affecting TST of anxiety disorder requires future investigation.",김혜민,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75056437
청소년의 인터넷게임 및 스마트폰 중독과 부모의 개입 정도의 관계,"Objectives ： The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Internet-gaming/smartphone addiction and parental involvement. Methods ： From March 2018 to October 2018, a total of 2,701 students in elementary school (n=1,382), middle school (n=798), and high school (n=521) were surveyed in a district in Seoul. The questionnaire included the degree of parental involvement in Internet gaming and smartphone usage and addictive symptoms on these media. The parental attitude was graded as ‘1=completely restrictive/2=mostly restrictive and partially permissive/3=mostly permissive and partially restrictive/4= completely permissive’. Results ： Parent group 4 for Internetgaming and parent group 3 for smartphone usage were significantly related to addictive conditions in each media usage. Parent group 1 for smartphone usage was related to less addictive conditions in students. Conclusion : Parental strategy to prevent adolescent s addiction for Internet-gaming and smartphone would differ according to the media type used. Further study would be helpful to reveal the relationship and prevent the addictive problem in this issue. This issue should not be limited to the areas of parental role and responsibility, but more social interest and systemic efforts should be put in place.",강윤석(Yoonsuk Kang),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100559320

노인의 요실금과 우울증이 삶의 질에 미치는 영향,"Objectives：Little is known about the influence of urinary incontinence and depression on individual’s QOL(Quality of life). We aimed to clarify how the interaction between urinary incontinence and depression influences one’s QOL.
Methods：A total of 1262 patients were enrolled in this study from April, 2011 to July, 2011. We estimated the severity of depressive symptoms and QOL, using SGDS-K, EQ-5D. We also investigated the morbidity of urinary incontinence for each patient in person or by questionnaire. Comparisons of QOL between groups with or without depression, with or without urinary incontinence were established using t-test, ANOVA and Scheffe’s post hoc analysis. The interaction between urinary incontinence and depression was analyzed by each domain of QOL, using multiple regression analysis.
Results：Patients with depression and urinary incontinence showed significantly higher EQ-5D scores on every domain of QOL than other patients, which means significantly lower QOL. Patients with depression, no urinary incontinence reported lower QOL, especially in the domain of ‘usual activity’, ‘anxiety’ and ‘visual analogue scale(VAS)’, whereas those with urinary incontinence, no depression showed lower QOL in ‘motility’, ‘usual activities’ and ‘pain’ domain. Statistically significant interaction effects of two diseases were observed in the domain of ‘VAS’, ‘self care’ and ‘anxiety’.
Conclusions：Comorbidity of urinary incontinence and depression showed significantly lower QOL of patients, compared with urinary incontinence or depression respectively, which implies additive interaction effects of the two diseases. Optimal diagnosis and treatment of depression should be emphasized for patients with urinary incontinence.",김지현,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100664599
