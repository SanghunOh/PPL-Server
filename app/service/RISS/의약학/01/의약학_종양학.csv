Cystosine deaminase (CD) is the enzyme that transforms the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine to highly toxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This study was performed to investigate the migration ability of CD gene transduced human neural stem cells (Hb1.F3-CD) toward prostate cancer after systemic treatment in C57B mice.
Materials and Methods: An Hb1.F3 with a retroviral vector encoding v-myc, lacZ was generated and transfected with recombinant retrovirus from the pMSCV-puro/CD. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed to evaluate the expression of CD in Hb1.F3-CD. In vivo migration assay after systemic injection of Hb1.F3-CD was performed in prostate cancer induced C57B mice using molecular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and immunochemical staining.
Results: Transgene expression in CD-hNSCs was demonstrated. In vivo migration ability of CD-hNSCs cells toward TRAMPC2 induced prostate cancer was found using MR imaging and X-gal stain after implantation of HB1.F3-CD in C57B mice.
Conclusions: We confirmed the migration ability of HB1.F3-CD toward prostate cancer cells after systemic treatment in C57B mice. This finding may imply a possible novel selective chemotherapeutic strategy against prostate cancer.",송윤섭(Yun Seob Song),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100131752

인유두종바이러스 관련 질환의 예방을 위한 남성 대상 백신의 임상적 유용성,"HHPV (Human Papillomavirus) is a DNA virus that can cause benign lesions, genitourinary cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer by penetrating the mucous membrane and skin. It is widely known to be transmitted mainly through sexual contact. As with many viral infections, vaccines have been developed to prevent infection with HPV. Currently, in many countries, HPV vaccines are mainly used for national immunization for women to prevent diseases that traditionally occur frequently in women, especially cervical cancer. However, since the vaccination rate is relatively low, many countries are struggling with ways to increase the vaccination rate. Meanwhile, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer caused by HPV in men has been increasing recently. In the United States, the annual number of oropharyngeal cancers in men already exceeds the number of cervical cancers in women, so HPV infection in men has emerged as a major problem. Accordingly, interest in HPV vaccination in men has also increased, and studies on the effectiveness and necessity of vaccination of both women and men compared to women alone are being actively conducted. In this paper, the evidence of HPV vaccination for men will be reviewed through previous studies, and its validity and cost-effectiveness will be analyzed to bolster the clinical usefulness of HPV vaccination for men.",이세영(Sei Young Lee),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108167605

비뇨기암 환자의 말기 암성통증의 이해와 관리,"Urinary tumors include cancers that commonly occur throughout the population, such as bladder cancer, kidney cancer, ureter cancer, and prostate cancer. The incidence of urological tumors in Korea is increasing. As the treatments of patients with cancer, such as operation, target therapy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy, are being developed, the life expectancy has been increasing. However, significant number of patients experience disease progression despite of existing treatments. Therefore, symptom direct treatment is crucial in oncologic era. Symptoms of patients with cancer vary but pain is one of the most common symptoms. Therefore, proper pain management is essential for the patients to improve the quality of life. Pain in cancer has as many complex pathological and physical characteristics as various tumor types. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are important to address the full spectrum of cancer pain in patients. Many approaches to pain control, including opioid analgesics, radiation, and interventional care, are included in pain control therapy. Clinicians working with urinary tumors should be familiar with these pain control options. This review is intended to provide practical help to clinicians in treating patients with urological tumors.

Methods：Brain tumor patients with and without headaches were recruited. Sex, age, combined symptoms, neurological findings, and radiological characteristics were reviewed in both groups. Results：Sixty-nine patients(46 with and 23 without headache) comprised our study population. Intracranial pressure (ICP) symptoms were more prevalent in the headache group compared to the non-headache group(p=0.012). However, no other clinical differences were noted between the two groups. The prevalence of headache was increased in patients with metastatic brain tumor than primary brain tumor but there was no statistical significance. The characteristics of the headache were non-specific and could not be differentiated between malignant and benign brain tumors. Conclusion：Headache in brain tumor patients present in a non-specific characteristic.

이하선 절제술 후 요오드-녹말 검사를 이용한 Frey 증후군의 발생 빈도 및 임상 양상,"Objectives: Frey's syndrome is an infrequent complication after parotidectomy and its incidence varies from 23.5% to 50.8% in the literature. The objective of this study was to evaluate the actual incidence and clinical characteristics of Frey's syndrome.
Methods: We analyzed 31 patients who underwent parotidectomy and serial Minor's starch-iodine test. The mean follow-up period was 66 ± 26.1 months (range, 24-118 months). The Frey's syndrome was analyzed using a questionnaire for the assessment of the subjective symptom and Minor's starch-iodine test for the objective meas-urement at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the surgery and then every 6 or 12 months. Minor's starch-iodine test was graded from 0 to 3 according to the area of discolorization.
Results: Frey's syndrome occurred in 11 patients (35.5%) on the Minor's starch-iodine test. The mean onset of Frey's syndrome on the starch-iodine test was 13.6 ± 10.4 months after parotidectomy. Sixteen patients (51.6%) complained about gustatory sweating and flushing. The onset of the subjective symptom was 11.27 ± 6.96 months after the surgery. There was a significant correlation between the grade of the starch-iodine test and the severity of subjective symptoms (P <0.001). Various factors including size and location of tumor, incision method, and extent of parotidectomy did not correlate with the Frey's syndrome.
Conclusion: The incidence of Frey's syndrome was 35.5% on the Starch-Iodine test, and the onset was about postoperative 13.6 months.",강태욱(Tae Wook Kang),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82297014
인유두종바이러스 연관 구인두암의 치료 약화 전략,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a causative agent for a subset of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). The current standard of care (SOC) for locally advanced OPC is 70 Gy definitive radiotherapy (RT) concurrent with cisplatin, which entails significant proportions of acute and late grade 3 or higher toxicities. Accordingly, discovery of favorable prognosis of HPV-related OPC has led to enthusiasm to attenuate subspecialties therapy in multidisciplinary treatment. Diverse deintensification strategies were investigated in multiple phase 2 trials with an assumption that attenuated treatments result in comparable oncologic outcome and less toxicities compared with SOC. Several trials on chemotherapy deintensification revealed that concomitant administration of cisplatin is not to be omitted or substituted for cetuximab without compromising progression-free survival or local control. A transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is investigated as alternative local treatment, but TORS plus SOC or mild deintensified adjuvant RT showed similar toxicities and inferior oncologic outcomes compared with SOC definitive RT or moderately deintensified RT. However, it has been reported that TORS plus deintensified 30-36 Gy adjuvant RT results in excellent outcome and less late toxicity compared with SOC adjuvant RT. Several phase 2 trials reported apparently equivalent progression-free survival and local control and similar adverse effects with moderately deintensified 60 Gy RT compared with SOC 70 Gy RT. Further dose reduction below 60 Gy has been investigated using biology- directed approaches, which use response to induction chemotherapy or metabolic images to triage HPV-positive OPC for deintensified RT. In summary, these trials provide valuable insights for future directions. Available evidence consistently showed that moderately deintensified RT is effective and safe for HPV-positive OPC in both definitive and adjuvant settings. Concurrent cisplatin remains an essential component without which progression- free survival is significantly compromised for advanced HPV-positive OPC. A simple incorporation of TORS to SOC may be detrimental for oncologic outcome without anticipated toxicity reduction. Given the lack of level 1 evidence, it is prudent to curb an unjustified deviation from the current SOC and limit any deintensified strategies to clinical trials and adhere to the current SOC.",김진호(Jin Ho Kim),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107304525
예후가 좋지 않은 갑상선암에 대한 최신 치료 방침,"Thyroid cancer is one of the slow-growing tumors with excellent oncological outcomes. However, a small set of patients with unexpectedly severe outcomes are usually ignored. Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) remains one of the most aggressive and lethal solid tumors. Recently, dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy or neoadjuvant BRAF induction therapy has shown promising results. In addition, a combination of targeted drugs, immunotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy can improve overall survival in ATC patients. Another disease for which there is no breakthrough treatment is radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). To date, multikinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lenvatinib) targeting the growth factor signaling pathway have been developed and approved as anticancer agents for patients with advanced DTC.

초기 성문암 환자에서 소분할조사법의 방사선 치료 결과와 예후 인자,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to establish general guidelines for the treatment of patients with early glottic cancer(T1-2N0M0), by assessing the role of primary radiation therapy and by analyzing the tumor-related and treatment-related factors that influence treatment results. We also studied the results of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early glottic cancer.
Material and Methods: This retrospective study comprised 48 patients who suffered from early glottic cancer and were treated by primary radiotherapy at Inha University Hospital, between May 1997 and October 2004. T-stage distribution showed 38 patients as T1 and 10 patients as stage T2. Thirty-eight patients underwent hypofractionated radiotherapy using a 6 MY photon beam, a total tumor dose of 63Gy, in 5 weekly fractions of 2.25Gy, with an overall radiation treatment time of 38 days. Ten patients in the T2 stage tolerated a total dose of 63-72 Gy(median 68.4Gy) in 5 weekly fractions of 1.8-2.0Gy, with an overall radiation treatment time of 40-87 days(median 51 days). All patients were followed up for at least 3 years. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the prognostic factors affecting the treatment results.
Result: The 5-year survival rate was 92% for all patients, 94% for T1 patients and 91% for T2 patients. The local control rate was 93.5% for all patients, 95% for T1 and 92.2% for T2 patients. Three patients suffered a relapse following radiotherapy, and underwent subsequent salvage surgery. We included T-stage, tumor location, total radiation dose, field size and overall radiation treatment time as potential prognostic factors. Only T-stage was found to be statistically significant in the univariate analysis, but in the multivariate analysis, it was not found to be significant.
Conclusion: High curative and voice preservation rates were obtained with hypofractionated radiotherapy. Further study with a larger number of patients is needed to determine the prognostic factors affecting treatment results.",이미조(Mi Jo Lee),2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108358902

The aim of this study was to investigate recurrence rate and disease free survival depending on the gross extrathyroidal extension (gETE) or the number of metastatic lymph node identified in patients with PTC. Materials & Methods: We assessed 3373 patients with PTC who underwent lobectomy at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (Seoul, Korea) between January 2009 and December 2014. Clinicopathological characteristics and long-term surgical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed through complete chart reviews. The mean follow-up duration was 97.1 ± 21.4 months. Results: The rate of recurrence was higher in gETE group (1.8% vs. 6.0%, p=0.004), leading to decreased disease free survival in Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank p<0.001). N1 group (n=1389) was analyzed into two groups whether the number of positive nodes is more than 5 or less. For the group of the more metastatic nodes, the recurrence rate higher compared to the other group (3.0% vs. 9.3%, p<0.001). DFS was longer in the group that had lesser metastatic nodes (log-rank p<0.001). However, in terms of N1 group over 1cm (n=492), No statistical difference was observed according to the number of positive lymph nodes (4.5% vs. 9.1%, p=0.092) Conclusion: When it comes to node positive PTC, Despite the number of positive lymph nodes was over 5, follow-up with no further surgery can be an option.",강일구(Il Ku Kang),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107841585
Relationship of Prostate-Specific Antigen Level With Obesity Indices in Korean Middle-Aged Population,"Purpose: We evaluated the relationship of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and obesity indices (weight, body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC]) in Korean middle-aged men.
Materials and Methods: From February to September 2013, 1,900 police men under 60 years old who participated in a prostate health screening program were included this cross-sectional study. All subjects underwent clinical examinations including weight, height, BMI, WC, fasting blood sugar, lipid profiles, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and PSA. Total prostate volume (TPV) was assessed clinically. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression tests were performed to evaluate the obesity indices and PSA relationships.
Results: The mean age was 52.0±4.7 years, and the mean PSA was 0.97±0.99 ng/mL. The PSA showed a significant positive correlation with the age (r=0.108, p＜0.01), TPV (r=0.349, p＜0.01), height (r=-0.052, p＜0.05), weight (r=0.186, p＜0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=0.056, p＜0.05), and GFR (r=-0.096, p＜0.01).
All obesity indices including weight, BMI, and WC showed negative correlations with PSA (beta=-0.013, p＜0.001; beta=-0.039, p＜0.001; and beta=-0.010, p=0.005; respectively) in age and TPV-adjusted model.
Conclusions: Common obesity indices (weight, BMI, and WC) were associated with lower PSA in Korean middle-aged population.

We comparatively analyzed clinicopathological factors associated with the presence of lymph node (LN) metastasis and ENE, respectively. Results: Variable factors of primary tumor characteristics such as lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, largest diameter of tumor, depth of invasion and maximum standardized uptake value were significantly associated with the presence of cervical LN metastasis. The largest diameter of tumor was statistically significant also in multivariate analysis for predicting the LN metastasis. Meanwhile, the association between primary tumor characteristics and the presence of ENE were not statistically significant except the primary tumor size. Importantly, factors associated with LN characteristics including the maximum diameter and number of metastatic LNs were significantly associated with ENE. Conclusion: In this study, several factors affecting cervical LN metastasis and ENE in oral cancer patients were identified.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight secondary healthcare institutions were involved in the survey of questionnaire study which includes overall status of urology department and private information of 357 patients transferred from other departments of same institution or other healthcare institutions.
Results: The number of hospital bed was 267 and the urologists were at work for 4.7 years on average. In 35/38 (92%) institutions, only one urologist was at work for clinical practice. Average patients number was 39.7 per day in the outpatient clinic and the portion of urological patients among the outpatients were 76.4%. Average patients number was 20.6 per month in the inpatient clinic and average number of urological surgery was 18.6. The portion of patients transferred from other departments of same institution or other healthcare institutions was 16.4%. The answer which shows good communication between other departments of same institution was 78.9% and facilitating relationship among other healthcare institutions was 47.4%. Analysis of 357 patients shows that the period of symptom development was 26.2 months and the period of prior treatment in other department or institution was 5.3 months. Bladder related disease was most common and the next order of frequency were prostate disease and urinary stone. The rate of concordance of final diagnosis between urology and other department or institution was 52.7%, and rate of concordance of medication was 23.0%. The positive answer as ‘helpful"" for the prior treatment in the other department or institution was 41.2%.
Conclusions: The department of Urology in secondary healthcare institution has several limitations such as relative lack of man power and expertise, lack of awareness of patients or other physicians to urology specialty, and insufficient communication with other departments or institutions. In many case, urological diseases have been managed in other departments and it takes much limitation to help the urological patients. Therefore urologists in secondary health care institution should try to upgrade their specialty and make effort to educate and promote urological concern as well as better communication with other medical departments.",김종현(Jong Hyun Kim),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A77021487
일개병원에서의 비뇨기계통의 말기 환자의 임상적 특징과 완화적 돌봄,"Purpose: The end of person""s life can be one of the most important times in that life. Physicians, nurses and volunteer workers are not sufficiently trained, understood to be competent or confident in end-life care. The purpose of this study was to understand clinical characteristics, and the combination of active and compassionate therapies of end-life-of patients in urology.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 21 patients who died during the end-stage-life care at the department of urology of one hospital from April 2000 to January 2009.
Results: There were 14 males and 7 females. The most prevalent reason for admission was pain (17 patients). The average survival in hospital was 22.72±16.16 months, visual analogue scale was 7.61±1.02, admission number of last 6 months was 2.67±1.5, period of last admission was 17.06±15.22 days, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 1 case.
Conclusions: Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and assessment and treatment of pain and other problems. It is very important to manage pain in terminal urologic diseases. Therefore continuous education and promotion of hospice and palliative care is needed for an effective care for the patients and doctors.",허정식(Jung-Sik Huh),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99884756
뇌하수체 종양에 대한 경접형동접근술의 효과,"Objective：The transsphenoidal approach(TSA) for pituitary tumor has evolved significantly since it was described initially during the first decade of the 20th century. This study was to evaluate the efficacy of TSA and prognosis of pituitary tumor after TSA. Methods：We analyzed 51 cases of pituitary tumor which underwent transsphenoidal approach about radiologic findings, symptoms, results and prognosis from 2000 to 2002 with literature review. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-test with SPSS Ver 11.0 and considered significant for value less than 0.05. Results：There were 35 functional adenomas, 11 nonfunctional adenomas and 5 other lesions among 51cases. Follow up MRIs show that remnant mass after TSA existed on medial compartment of cavernous sinus and suprasellar area that didn`t descend during TSA in spite of valsalva maneuver. 7 cases(13.7%) recurred after TSA. Among them 3 case underwent repeated TSA and the other 1 case endured transcranial approach and gamma-knife radiosurgery applicated to another 2 cases. There was statistical significance between stage and extent of removal(p=0.0005). There were no significant complications and mortality related to TSA. Conclusion：Although remnant rate of pituitary tumor after TSA was 45%, this approach offered excellent decompression to optic chiasm and could be a safe and effective approach to pituitary tumor if it is supported with endoscope introduction to sellar fossa and additional therapy such as gamma-knife radiosurgery.",전진호 ( Jin Ho Jeon ),2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103130200
방광암 환자의 개인 맞춤형 약물 개발의 접근법 제시,"Bladder cancer, which affects the bladder mucosa, is the ninth most common disease worldwide. There are many types of cancerous tissue in the bladder. Most exhibit low malignancy, but their recurrence rate is higher in comparison to more malignant tissues. Only 10%-15% progress to invasive bladder cancer and metastasize to the lung, liver, and bone, which is significantly difficult to treat. The anticancer efficacy developed for the treatment of highly malignant bladder cancer does not equally apply to all patients, and the side effects vary. To solve this problem, studies have been conducted on various verification systems and patient-specific drug development. For example, an organ-on-a-chip model using patient cancer cells is being actively researched as an anticancer drug verification system. A study on screening anticancer drugs according to cancer biomarkers unique to individual patients is also in progress. In addition, studies have recently been conducted on immune anticancer drugs that exhibit excellent anticancer efficacy. This report discusses various validation systems and drug screening criteria for the development of patient-specific drugs. We propose that it is possible to evaluate the efficacy of anticancer drugs for each patient, understand drug mechanism patterns in humans, and develop treatment that prevents cancer metastasis.",설향숙(Hyang Sook Seol),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105805064
2021 대한비뇨기종양학회 신암연구회 Consensus Statement: 전이성 신세포암의 종양감축 신적출술,"Purpose: The Korean Renal Cancer Study Group (KRoCS) provides consensus recommendations on the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CRN) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).Materials and Methods: A group of mRCC experts from the Korean Urological Oncology Society convened at the 2021 KRoCS meeting on CRN for mRCC.Results: The consensus document was developed to address 4 questions related that were judged to be the most relevant to patient care: (1) Is there a role for CRN in patients planning targeted therapy? (2) Is there a role for CRN in patients planning immuno-oncology agents? (3) When is the optimal time of CRN in patients planning systemic treatment? (4) What is the ideal patient selection for CRN? The panelists have come up with following consensus. For mRCC patients, CRN should be considered only in those with IMDC (International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium) favorable and intermediate risk disease, regardless of the systemic treatment plans. Timing of CRN should consider the risk group as well as the number of risk factors, but is generally recommended for after assessing the degree of response to initial systemic treatment. Patients with good performance status, limited metastatic burden on top of resectable primary tumor are candidates recommended for CRN with or without metastasectomy with priority.Conclusions: In conclusion, there is still a role for CRN in the multimodality treatment of mRCC. Careful patient selection is of paramount importance. As the treatment landscape of mRCC continues to change, the role of CRN in the current immuno-oncology era will require more exploration.",이찬호,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107926844
작은 신장 종양의 국소 치료,"Image-guided thermal ablation is accepted as one of non-invasive modalities in the treatment of small renal tumor. Current EAU and AUA guidelines suggest cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation in patients with small renal tumor with/without significant comorbidities. Cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation have been most commonly used in the treatment of small renal tumor. A new ablation modality, microwave ablation, has been of increasing interest in the treatment of small renal tumor. Clinical studies show that ablation therapy is an effective treatment with good clinical outcomes and low risk of complications in selected patients over short- and medium-term periods of time.

정위성방광대치술을 시행받은 방광암 환자의 기능적 결과 및 삶의 질,"Radical cystectomy is the golden standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Urinary diversion is the prerequisite procedure after cystectomy and various type of urinary diversion has been introduced. Urinary diversion carries surgical morbidities, postoperative complications in terms of urinary function and sexual function, and issues for quality of life, which are important considerations for selecting urinary diversion. Ileal conduit urinary diversion and orthotopic bladder substitution have been regarded as the representative urinary diversion after radical cystectomy. There have been great efforts to compare the functional outcomes and quality of life between these two types of urinary diversion. Although orthotopic bladder substitution seems to a more natural and desirable urinary diversion, the currently available evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion that orthotopic bladder is an absolutely superior form of urinary diversion. However, the vast majority of studies demonstrated that orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion shows at least equal or a marginally better quality of life scores compared to ileal conduit diversion. The favorable outcomes of orthotopic neobladder would be more pronounced especially when considering relatively young and healthy patients.",박상언(Sang Un Park),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82296916
소아청소년 갑상선암의 임상적 특징들 : 단일 기관에서의 20년간의 연구,"Background/Objectives: Pediatric & Adolescent thyroid cancer is a steadily increasing malignancy. We aimed to report our experience at a single tertiary institution and to evaluate the risk factors for recurrence in pediatric & adolescent patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Materials & Methods: The data of 42 pediatric & adolescent patients (aged ≤19 years) with DTC who underwent thyroidectomy at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital (Seoul, Korea) between December 1997 and February 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic features and surgical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed through complete chart reviews. Results: The mean age was 16.6 years. A total of 6 (14.3%) patients experienced recurrence after initial treatment. The recurrence rate was significantly different between total thyroidectomy (TT) and lobectomy groups(23.1% vs. 0%, p=0.038). However, no statistically significant differences were found in the recurrence rate according to lymph node ratio (LNR) of 0.4 (10.7% vs 21.4%; P=0.383). Multivariate analysis confirmed age (hazard ratio [HR], 0.443; P=0.008) and bilaterality (HR, 11.477; P=0.022) as significant risk factors for DFS. Conclusion: Pediatric & Adolescent thyroid cancer is a rare malignancy and TT is recommended as the treatment of choice. However, lobectomy may be considered for Pediatric & Adolescent patients with age >16 years, tumor size <1 cm, and no bilateral disease.",문기윤(Ki Yoon Moon),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100131671

"임상 : 뇌하수체 종양에 대한 코를 통한 내시경 수술과 접형동 접근술 간의 임상적, 수술학적 비교","Objective：Microsurgical transsphenoidal approach(TSA) had been known as the choice of surgical approach to pituitary adenoma. Recently, several authors asserted endoscopic approach to the pituitary lesions. We tried to compare endonasal endoscopic approach(EEA) with sublabial microsurgical transsphenoidal approach(TSA) in clinical and technical aspects. Method：Among the total 34cases that underwent the pituitary surgery between September 1993 and September 2001 in our institute, 20cases of pituitary adenoma underwent sublabial transsphenoidal microsurgery and 14cases of same pathology underwent endonasal endoscopic surgery by the same surgeon. We analyzed the clinical symptoms and signs, size and extension of tumors, removal rate, hospital day, and postoperative complications including diabetes insipidus(DI), cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) leakage, hormonal dysfunction. Also, the details of technical difference and operative findings were compared. Result：There are no statistical differences of age and sex distribution, preoperative hormonal dysfunction, size and extension of tumor between two groups. In TSA group, total resection was done in 4cases(20%), whereas 8cases(57%) in EEA group. Postoperative transient DI was visible in 7cases(35%) of TSA, whereas in 2cases(14%) of EEA. Only 1case (5%) showed postoperative CSF leakage in TSA group, and also 1 case(7%) in EEA. Two groups showed remarkable difference in hospital stay；19.5 days in TSA, 4.8 days in EEA. Conclusion：Endonasal endoscopic approach could substitute the transsphenoidal approach for pituitary adenoma.
