The immune system has mechanisms which can attack the virus in extracellular and intracellular phase of life cycle, and which involve both non-specific and specific effectors. The survival of viruses depends on the survival of their hosts, and therefore the immune system and viruses have evolved together. Immune responses to viral infection may be variable depending on the site of infection, the mechanism of cell-to-cell spread of virus, physiology of the host, host genetic variation, and environmental condition. Viral infection of cells directly stimulates the production of interferons and they induce antiviral state in the surrounding cells. Complement system is also involved in the elimination of viruses and establishes the first line of defence with other non-specific immunity. During the course of viral infection, antibody is most effective at an early stage, especially before the virus enters its target cells. The virus- specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are the principal effector cells in clearing established viral infections. But many viruses have resistant mechanism to host immune responses in every step of viral infection to cells. Some viruses have immune evasion mechanism and establish latency or persistency indefinitely. Furthermore antibodies to some viruses can enhance the disease by the second infection. Immune responses to viral infection are very different from those to bacterial infection. (Immune Network 2004;4(2):73-80)",황응수,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103891314
운동이 면역력에 미치는 효과분석,"The immune response to any stimulus is complex, requiring coordinated action by several types of cells in a tightly regulated sequence. Thus, a physical stress such as exercise may act at any number of points in the complex sequence of events collectively termed the immune response. Although exercise causes many propound changes in parameters of immune function, the nature and magnitude of such changes rely on several factors including the immune parameters of interest; type, intensity, and duration of exercise; fitness level or exercise history of the subject; environmental factors such as ambient temperature and humidity. Although regular moderate exercise appears to be important factor for increasing immunity, Athletes are susceptible to illness, in particular upper respiratory track infection, during periods of intense training and after competition. In addition, in elite athletes, frequent illness is associated with overtraining syndrome, a neuroendocrine disorder resulting from excessive training. Through this paper, we want to investigate the effects of exercise on the immunosuppression such as exercise induced lymphopenia, asthma, anaphylaxis, URT (upper respiratory track), and TB (tuberculosis) infection. and also, we want to suggest a direct mechanism, protection and therapy of exercise induced immunosuppression.",곽이섭,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103893679
암백신,"Cancer vaccine is an active immunotherapy to stimulate the immune system to mount a response against the tumor specific antigen. Working as a stimulant to the body's own immune system, cancer vaccines help the body recognize and destroy targeted cancers and may help to shrink advanced tumors. Research is currently underway to develop therapeutic cancer vaccines. It is also possible to develop prophylactic vaccines in the future. The whole cell approach to eradicate cancer has used whole cancer cells to make vaccine. In an early stage of this approach, whole cell lysate or a mixture of immunoadjuvant and inactivated cancer cells has been used. Improved vaccines are being developed that utilize cytokines or costimulatory molecules to mount an attack against cancer cells. In case of melanoma, these vaccines are expected to have a therapeutic effect of vaccine. Furthermore, it is attempting to treat stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer. Other vaccines are being developing that are peptide vaccine, recombinant vaccine and dendritic cell vaccine. Out of them, reintroduction of antigen-specific dendritic cells into patient and DNA vaccine are mostly being conducted. Currently, research and development efforts are underway to develop therapeutic cancer vaccine such as DNA vaccine for the treatment of multiple forms of cancers.",손은화,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103893676
"Aging and the Immune System: the Impact of Immunosenescence on Viral Infection, Immunity and Vaccine Immunogenicity","Immunosenescence is characterized by a progressive deterioration of the immune system associated with aging. Multiple components of both innate and adaptive immune systems experience aging-related changes, such as alterations in the number of circulating monocytic and dendritic cells, reduced phagocytic activities of neutrophils, limited diversity in B/T cell repertoire, T cell exhaustion or inflation, and chronic production of inflammatory cytokines known as inflammaging. The elderly are less likely to benefit from vaccinations as preventative measures against infectious diseases due to the inability of the immune system to mount a successful defense. Therefore, aging is thought to decrease the efficacy and effectiveness of vaccines, suggesting aging-associated decline in the immunogenicity induced by vaccination. In this review, we discuss aging-associated changes in the innate and adaptive immunity and the impact of immunosenescence on viral infection and immunity. We further explore recent advances in strategies to enhance the immunogenicity of vaccines in the elderly. Better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying immunosenescence-related immune dysfunction will provide a crucial insight into the development of effective elderly-targeted vaccines and immunotherapies.",오수진,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106501827
Compound 48/80과 anti-DNP IgE로 유도되는 비만세포 활성화에 대한 복분자의 억제효과,"Background: The fruit of Rubus coreanus (RC), a perennial herb, has been cultivated for a long time as a popular vegetable. The anti-allergy mechanism of RC is unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate the inhibitory effect of RC on compound 48/80- or anti-DNP IgE-induced mast cell activation. Methods: For this, influences of RC on the compound 48/80-induced degranulation, histamine release, calcium influx and the change of the intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine-3',5' monophosphate) levels of rat peritoneal mast cells (RPMC) and on the anti-DNP IgE-induced histamine release of RPMC were observed. Results: The pretreatment of RC inhibited compound 48/ 80-induced degranulation, histamine release and intracelluar calcium uptake of RPMC. The anti-DNP IgE-induced histamine release of RPMC was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of RC. The RC increased the level of intracellular cAMP of RPMC, and the pretreatment of RC inhibited compound 48/80-induced decrement of intracellular cAMP of RPMC. Conclusion: These results suggest that RC contains some substances with an activity to inhibit the compound 48/80- or anti-DNP IgE-induced mast cell activitation. The inhibitory effects of RC are likely due to the stabilization of mast cells by blocking the calcium uptake and enhancing the level of intracellular cAMP.

Potential Roles of Innate Immune Chemokine and Cytokine Network on Lipopolysaccharide-Based Therapeutic Approach in Ovarian Cancer,"Ovarian cancer (OC), the deadliest gynecological cancer, results in poor overall survival, urgently requiring a novel therapeutic approach. As cumulative exposures to endotoxins decreased OC risk epidemiologically, we evaluated if LPS, a Toll-like receptor 4 agonist known as active component of endotoxins, could increase survival in the murine peritoneal dissemination model of SKOV-3 OC cells. LPS significantly increased the mean survival time of more than 116 days compared with 63 days in the control. Furthermore, no tumor burden was present in three mice among eight LPS-treated mice. SKOV-3 cells were not responsive to LPS and showed unaltered chemokine signature. Rather than direct effects to OC cells, LPS was found to increase proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, such as CXCL1, CXCL8, TNF, and IL-1B, in innate immune system. Taken together, LPS is likely to potentiate the cytotoxic-related innate immunogenicity via proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, which attenuates the peritoneal dissemination of OC.",Rosa Mistica C.

면역학적 노화 기전에 관한 연구: T 및 B 세포의 변화,"Background: An immunological approach for aging mechanism appears to be important. Lymphocyte subsets analysis in peripheral blood is widely performed to assess the immune status and to diagnose and monitor various diseases. Some lymphocyte subsets are known to change with age, but only few data about age-related reference ragnes for these subsets in healthy individuals have been reported. So we attempted to report reference ranges for these subsets in each age group and review changes of the results with age for the secondary studies about immune cell function as lymphocyte blast transformation and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement (VDJ) including recombination activating genes (RAG-1 and RAG-2). Methods: Lymphocyte subset analysis was performed on 302 subjects, 189 males and 113 females with age group of all decades of life. Two color direct immunofluorescene flow cytometry (FCM) was done using $Simultest^{TM}$ IMK-Lymphocyte kit (Becton Dickinson, USA), $FACScan^{TM}$ (Becton Dickinson, USA) and $FACSCalibur^{TM}$ (Becton Dickinson, USA). Lymphocyte subsets analysed were T ($CD3^+$) and B cells ($CD19^+$), helper/inducer T ($CD4^+$) and suppressor/cytotoxic T cells ($CD8^+$), helper/suppressor ($CD4^+/CD8^+$) ratio and natural killer (NK) cells ($CD3^-CD16^+/CD56^+$). The absolute numbers of each subset were calculated from total lymphocyte counts. Data collected was analysed using SAS 6.12. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: We reported the counts and percentages of lymphocyte and these subsets in each age group. There were no statistically significant differences between male and female subjects. The percentage of $CD4^+$ T cells, and the count of NK cells did not show the significant difference among the various age groups. The age-related changes observed in our study were as following: 1) a decrease in the percentages of T cells, B cells and $CD8^+$ T cells ; 2) a decrease in the counts of B cells and $CD8^+$ T cells ; 3) an increase in the percentage and count of NK cells ; and 4) an increase in the $CD4^+/CD8^+$ ratio. Conclusion: The characteristics of aging process appeared to be showing a marked decrease of lympocyte subsets T and B cells as well as T8 ($CD8^+$). The age-related increase of the percentage of cells bearing NK marker can be interpreted as a compensatory consequence to cope with the decrease of T cells related to the thymic involution. These changes with age appeared to be for the secondary study about immune cell function as lymphocyte blast transformation and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement.",김재식,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386233
류머티스 관절염과 골관절염 환자에서 Transforming growth factor β의 발현 양상,"The transforming growth $factor-{\beta}$ ($TGF-{\beta}$) is a multifunctional cytokine modulating the onset and course of autoimmune disease as shown in experimental models. In synovial inflammation, there is a potential role for $TGF-{\beta}$ in repairment, the inhibition of cartilage and bone destruction, and the down-regulation of immune response. The biologic effects of $TGF-{\beta}$ depend on the cell type, the isoform and the availability of active $TGF-{\beta}$. We investigated $TGF-{\beta}$ expression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and compared to those of osteoarthritis (OA). And we determined a correlation between $TGF-{\beta}1$ and $TGF-{\beta}2$, and also the relationships between each $TGF-{\beta}$ isoform and the parameters for disease activity of RA. Methods: The study population consisted of 20 patients with RA and 20 patients with OA. The commercial ELISA kit was used to study $TGF-{\beta}1$ and $TGF-{\beta}2$ levels in peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluids (SF). Results: 1) While PB $TGF-{\beta}1$ level was of no difference between RA and OA patient groups, SF $TGF-{\beta}1$ level was higher in RA group than OA group. Similarly, PB $TGF-{\beta}2$ levels of RA and OA groups was not different, but SF $TGF-{\beta}2$ levels was higher in RA group than OA group. 2) In patients with RA, the $TGF-{\beta}1$ levels were higher than $TGF-{\beta}2$ in both the PB and SF, while in patients with OA, there showed higher readings for $TGF-{\beta}1$ than $TGF-{\beta}2$ in SF but no difference between $TGF-{\beta}1$ and $TGF-{\beta}2$ levels in PB. 3) In patients with RA, there were no correlations between PB $TGF-{\beta}1$ and PB $TGF-{\beta}2$ levels, nor between SF $TGF-{\beta}1$ and SF $TGF-{\beta}2$ levels. At the same way, there was no correlation between PB $TGF-{\beta}1$ and SF $TGF-{\beta}1$ levels, nor between each levels of $TGF-{\beta}2$ in patients with RA. 4) There was also no correlation between each $TGF-{\beta}$ isoform and the parameters for disease activity such as ESR, CRP, tender joint count, swollen joint count, rheumatoid factor, and the duration of morning stiffness except between in PB $TGF-{\beta}1$ and disease duration of RA (r=0.637, p<0.01). Conclusion: Each $TGF-{\beta}$ isoforms were higher in synovial fluid of patients with RA than that of patients with OA. The data from the RA patients demonstrated different patterns of expressions of the isoforms depending on which compartment (PB or SF) was investigated. The quantification of different $TGF-{\beta}$ isoform is thought to be important when $TGF-{\beta}$ is measured under disease conditions of RA.",김채기,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386234
항체 : 치료제로서의 부활,"Currently 18 monoclonal antibodies were approved by FDA for inj ection into humans for therapeutic or diagnostic purpose. And 146 clinical trials are under way to evaluate the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies as anti-cancer agents, which comprise 9 % of clinical trials in cancer therapy field. When considering a lot of disappointment and worries existed in this field during the past 15 years, this boom could be called as resurrection. Antibodies have several merits over small molecule drug. First of all it is easier and faster in development, as proper immunization of the target proteins usually raises good antibody response. The side effects of antibodies are more likely to be checked out in immunohistomchemical staining of whole human tissues. Antibody has better pharmacokinetics, which means a longer half-life. And it is non-toxic as it is purely a ""natural drug. Vast array of methods was developed to get the recombinant antibodies to be used as drug. The mice with human immunoglobulin genes were generated. Fully human antibodies can be developed in fast and easy way from these mice through immunization. These mice could make even human monoclonal antibodies against any human antigen like albumin. The concept of combinatorial library was also actively adopted for this purpose. Specific antibodies can be screened out from phage, mRNA, ribosomal library displaying recombinant antibodies like single chain Fvs or Fabs. Then the coding genes of these specific antibodies are obtained from the selected protein-gene units, and used for industrial scale production. Both $na\ddot{i}ve$ and immunized libraries are proved to be effective for this purpose. In post-map arena, antibodies are receiving another spotlight as molecular probes against numerous targets screened out from functional genomics or proteomics. Actually many of these antibodies used for this purpose are already human ones. Through alliance of these two actively growing research areas, antibody would play a central role in target discovery and drug development.",정홍근,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386214
노화의 기전과 예방,"Aging is a senescence and defined as a normal physiologic and structural alterations in almost all organ systems with age. As Leonard Hayflick, one of the first gerontologists to propose a theory of biologic aging, indicated that a theory of aging or longevity satisfies the changes of above conditions to be universal, progressive, intrinsic and deleterious. Although a number of theories have been proposed, it is now clear that cell aging (cell senescence) is multifactorial. No single mechanism can account for the many varied manifestations of biological aging. Many theories have been proposed in attempt to understand and explain the process of aging. Aging is effected in individual by genetic factors, diet, social conditions, and the occurrence of age-related diseases as diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis. It involves an endogenous molecular program of cellular senescence as well as continuous exposure throughout life to adverse exogenous influences, leading to progressive infringement on the cell's survivability so called wear and tear. So we could say the basic mechanism of aging depends on the irreversible and universal processes at cellular and molecular level. The immediate cause of these changes is probably an interference in the function of cell's macromolecules-DNA, RNA, and cell proteins-and in the flow of information between these macromolecules. The crucial questions, unanswered at present, concerns what causes these changes in truth. Common theories of aging are able to classify as followings for the easy comprehension. 1. Biological, 1) molecular theories - a. error theory, b. programmed aging theory, c. somatic mutation theory, d. transcription theory, e. run-out-of program theory, 2) cellular theories - a. wear and tear theory, b. cross-link theory, c. clinker theory, d. free radical theory, e. waste product theory, 3) system level theory-a. immunologic/autoimmune theory, 4) others - a. telomere theory, b. rate of living theory, c. stress theory, etc. Prevention of aging is theoretically depending on the cause or theory of aging. However no single theory is available and no definite method of delaying the aging process is possible by this moment. The most popular action is anti-oxidant therapy using vitamin E and C, melatonin and DHEA, etc. Another proposal for the reverse of life-span is TCP-17 and IL-16 administration from the mouse bone marrow B cell line study for the immunoglobulin VDJ rearrangement with RAG-1 and RAG-2.

HHD Mice를 이용한 대장암세포유래 펩타이드 특이적 CD8+ T 세포의 입양전이,"Background: 1-8D gene is a member of human 1-8 interferon inducible gene family and is shown to be overexpressed in fresh colon cancer tissues. Three peptides 1-6, 3-5 and 3-7 derived from 1-8D gene were shown to have immunogenicity against colon cancer. Methods: To study tumor immunotherapy of these peptides we established an adoptive transfer model. $D^{b-/-}{\times}{\beta}2$ microglobulin (${\beta}2m$) null mice transgenic for a chimeric HLA-A2.1/$D^b-{\beta}2m$ single chain (HHD mice) were immunized with irradiated peptide-loaded RMA-S/HHD/B7.1 transfectants. Spleens were removed after last immunization, and splenocytes were re-stimulated in vitro. Lymphocytes from vaccinated HHD mice were transferred together with IL-2 to the tumor bearing nude mice that were challenged S.C. with the HCT/HHD/B7 colon carcinoma cell line that was found to grow in these mice. Results: Peptide 3-5 was found to be highly effective in CTL activity. Adoptively transferred anti-peptide 3-5 cytolytic T lymphocytes caused significant retardation in tumor growth. Conclusion: This study shows that peptide 3-5 can be the most effective candidate for the vaccine of adoptive immunotherapy against colon cancer.",정헌순,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386211
Clinical Characteristics and Treatment of Immune-Related Adverse Events of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been changing the paradigm of cancer treatment. However, immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) have also increased with the exponential increase in the use of ICIs. ICIs can break up the immunologic homeostasis and reduce T-cell tolerance. Therefore, inhibition of immune checkpoint can lead to the activation of autoreactive T-cells, resulting in various irAEs similar to autoimmune diseases. Gastrointestinal toxicity, endocrine toxicity, and dermatologic toxicity are common side effects. Neurotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity are relatively rare but can be fatal. ICI-related gastrointestinal toxicity, dermatologic toxicity, and hypophysitis are more common with anti- CTLA-4 agents. ICI-related pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and myasthenia gravis are more common with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Treatment with systemic steroids is the principal strategy against irAEs. The use of immune-modulatory agents should be considered in case of no response to the steroid therapy. Treatment under the supervision of multidisciplinary specialists is also essential, because the symptoms and treatments of irAEs could involve many organs. Thus, this review focuses on the mechanism, clinical presentation, incidence, and treatment of various irAEs.",Juwhan Choi,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106609747
T 세포 매개 면역질환으로서의 건선,"Although the exact mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis of psoriasis is unclear, interferon-${\gamma}$ producing type 1 T cells have been reported to play a significant role. Infiltrating activated type 1 T cells in the lesions are believed to be responsible for stimulating keratinocytes, which produce many cytokines and growth factors. The hyperproliferative epidermis is understood to be the result of either the cytokines produced by the intraepidermal T cells or the reactive phenomenon after keratinocyte damage. The microenvironment in psoriatic lesions deviates toward the type 1 status, because of the increased type 1 cytokines and either the decreased or unchanged type 2 cytokines observed in psoriatic lesions. Therefore, this review focused on a T-cell-mediated immunological basis for the current hypothesis of the psoriasis pathogenesis.",유욱,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386250
The Role of MicroRNAs in Regulatory T Cells and in the Immune Response,"The discovery of microRNA (miRNA) is one of the major scientific breakthroughs in recent years and has revolutionized current cell biology and medical science. miRNAs are small (19∼25nt) noncoding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by targeting the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for degradation of translation repression. Genetic ablation of the miRNA machinery, as well as loss or degradation of certain individual miRNAs, severely compromises immune development and response, and can lead to immune disorders. Several sophisticated regulatory mechanisms are used to maintain immune homeostasis. Regulatory T (Treg)cells are essential for maintaining peripheral tolerance, preventing autoimmune diseases and limiting chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent publications have provided compelling evidence that miRNAs are highly expressed in Treg cells, that the expression of Foxp3 is controlled by miRNAs and that a range of miRNAs are involved in the regulation of immunity. A large number of studies have reported links between alterations of miRNA homeostasis and pathological conditions such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, as well as psychiatric and neurological diseases.
Although it is still unclear how miRNA controls Treg cell development and function, recent studies certainly indicate that this topic will be the subject of further research. The specific circulating miRNA species may also be useful for the diagnosis,classification, prognosis of diseases and prediction of the therapeutic response. An explosive literature has focussed on the role of miRNA. In this review, I briefly summarize the current studies about the role of miRNAs in Treg cells and in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune response. I also review the explosive current studies about clinical application of miRNA.",하대유,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103905977
Expression of Epstein-Barr Virus Gene and Clonality of Infiltrated T Lymphocytes in Epstein-Barr Virus-associated Gastric Carcinoma,"Background: Epstein-Barr virus associated gastric lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is characterized by the intensive infiltration of lymphoid cells, the presence of EBV,and the better prognosis over typical adenocarcinoma. Thus,it was assumable that viral latent proteins may be responsible for the recruitment of a certain T cell repertoire to EBV-associated gastric carcinoma. Methods: To examine above possibility, EBV gene expression in gastric carcinoma tissues and usage of TCR among the tumor infiltrating lymphocytes were analyzed. Results: EBV specific DNA and EBERs RNA were detected in 4 out of 30 patients. RT-PCR analysis revealed that all 4 of EBV-positive tumor tissues expressed EBNA1 mRNA and BARTs and LMP2a was detected only one sample out of 4. However, the EBNA2 and LMP-1transcripts were not detected in these tissues. CD8＋ T cells were the predominant population of infiltrating lymphocytes in the EBV-positive gastric carcinoma. According to spectra type analysis of infiltrating T cells, 10 predominant bands were detected by TCR Vβ CDR3 specific RT-PCR from 4EBV-positive tumor tissues. Sequence analysis of these bands revealed oligoclonal expansion of T cells. Conclusion:These findings suggest that clonally expanded T cells in vivo might be a population of cytotoxic T cells reactive to EBV-associated gastric carcinoma.",이재면,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103905978
Tiul1 and TGIF are Involved in Downregulation of TGFβ1-induced IgA Isotype Expression,"TGF-β1 is well known to induce Ig germ-line α (GLα) transcription
and subsequent IgA isotype class switching recombination
(CSR). Homeodomain protein TG-interacting
factor (TGIF) and E3-ubiquitin ligases TGIF interacting ubiquitin
ligase 1 (Tiul1) are implicated in the negative regulation
of TGF-β signaling. In the present study, we investigated
the roles of Tiul1 and TGIF in TGFβ1-induced IgA CSR. We
found that over-expression of Tiul1 decreased TGFβ1-induced
GLα promoter activity and strengthened the inhibitory
effect of Smad7 on the promoter activity. Likewise,
overexpression of TGIF also diminished GLα promoter activity
and further strengthened the inhibitory effect of Tiul1,
suggesting that Tiul1 and TGIF can down-regulate TGFβ1-
induced GLα expression. In parallel, overexpression of Tiul1
decreased the expression of endogenous IgA CSR-predicitive
transcripts (GLTα, PSTα, and CTα) and TGFβ1-induced
IgA secretion, but not GLTγ3 and IgG3 secretion.
Here, over-expressed TGIF further strengthened the inhibitory
effect of Tiul1. These results suggest that Tiul1 and
TGIF act as negatively regulators in TGFβ1-induced IgA isotype
expression.",박경훈,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103883887
Interactions between NCR + ILC3s and the Microbiome in the Airways Shape Asthma Severity,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease whose development is shaped by a variety of environmental and genetic factors. While several recent studies suggest that microbial dysbiosis in the gut may promote asthma, little is known about the relationship between the recently discovered lung microbiome and asthma. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have also been shown recently to participate in asthma. To investigate the relationship between the lung microbiome, ILCs, and asthma, we recruited 23 healthy controls (HC), 42 patients with non-severe asthma, and 32 patients with severe asthma. Flow cytometry analysis showed severe asthma associated with fewer natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR)+ILC3s in the lung. Similar changes in other ILC subsets, macrophages, and monocytes were not observed. The asthma patients did not differ from the HC in terms of the alpha and beta-diversity of the lung and gut microbiomes. However, lung function correlated positively with both NCR+ILC3 frequencies and microbial diversity in the lung. Sputum NCR+ILC3 frequencies correlated positively with lung microbiome diversity in the HC, but this relationship was inversed in severe asthma. Together, these data suggest that airway NCR+ILC3s may contribute to a healthy commensal diversity and normal lung function.",함종호,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107831213
Th17과 자가면역 관절염,"Autoimmune arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is a chronic inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the joints and then results in their progressive destruction. Effector Th cells have been classified as Th1 and Th2 subsets based on their cytokine expression profiles and immune regulatory function. Another subset of T cells termed Th17 was recendy discovered and known to selectively produce IL-17. Also, Th17 was shown to be generated by TGF${\beta}$ and IL-6 and maintained by IL-23. IL-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is considered to involve the development of various inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as RA, asthma, lupus, and allograft rejection. IL-17 is present in the sera, synovial fluids and synovial biopsies of most RA patient. IL-17 activates RA synovial fibroblasts to synthesize IL-6, IL-8 and VEGF via PI3K/Akt and NF-${\kappa}B$ dependent pathway. IL-17 increases IL-6 production, collagen destruction and collagen synthesis. In addition, it not only causes bone resorption but also increases osteoclastogenesis and fetal cartilage destruction. Inhibition of the IL-17 production may contribute a novel therapeutic approach along with potent anti-inflammatory effect and with less immunosuppressive effect on host defenses.",조미라,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386325
Regulation of Tumor Immune Surveillance and Tumor Immune Subversion by TGF-$\beta$,"Transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) is a highly pleiotropic cytokine playing pivotal roles in immune regulation. TGF-$\beta$ facilitates tumor cell survival and metastasis by targeting multiple cellular components. Focusing on its immunosuppressive functions, TGF-$\beta$ antagonists have been employed for cancer treatment to enhance tumor immunity. TGF-$\beta$ antagonists exert anti-tumor effects through #1 activating effector cells such as NK cells and cytotoxic $CD8^+$ Tcells (CTLs), #2 inhibiting regulatory/suppressor cell populations, #3 making tumor cells visible to immune cells, #4 inhibiting the production of tumor growth factors.

Prophylactic and Therapeutic Modulation of Innate and Adaptive Immunity Against Mucosal Infection of Herpes Simplex Virus,"Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are the most common cause of genital ulceration in humans worldwide. Typically, HSV-1 and 2 infections via mucosal route result in a lifelong latent infection after peripheral replication in mucosal tissues, thereby providing potential transmission to neighbor hosts in response to reactivation. To break the transmission cycle, immunoprophylactics and therapeutic strategies must be focused on prevention of infection or reduction of infectivity at mucosal sites. Currently, our understanding of the immune responses against mucosal infection of HSV remains intricate and involves a balance between innate signaling pathways and the adaptive immune responses. Numerous studies have demonstrated that HSV mucosal infection induces type I interferons (IFN) via recognition of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and activates multiple immune cell populations, including NK cells, conventional dendritic cells (DCs), and plasmacytoid DCs. This innate immune response is required not only for the early control of viral replication at mucosal sites, but also for establishing adaptive immune responses against HSV antigens. Although the contribution of humoral immune response is controversial, $CD4^+$ Th1 T cells producing IFN-${\gamma}$ are believed to play an important role in eradicating virus from the hosts. In addition, the recent experimental successes of immunoprophylactic and therapeutic compounds that enhance resistance and/or reduce viral burden at mucosal sites have accumulated. This review focuses on attempts to modulate innate and adaptive immunity against HSV mucosal infection for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Notably, cells involved in innate immune regulations appear to shape adaptive immune responses. Thus, we summarized the current evidence of various immune mediators in response to mucosal HSV infection, focusing on the importance of innate immune responses.","Uyangaa, Erdenebileg",2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105127648
NK Cell-Based Immunotherapies in Cancer,"With the development of technologies that can transform immune cells into therapeutic modalities, immunotherapy has remarkably changed the current paradigm of cancer treatment in recent years. NK cells are components of the innate immune system that act as key regulators and exhibit a potent tumor cytolytic function. Unlike T cells, NK cells exhibit tumor cytotoxicity by recognizing non-self, without deliberate immunization or activation. Currently, researchers have developed various approaches to improve the number and anti-tumor function of NK cells. These approaches include the use of cytokines and Abs to stimulate the efficacy of NK cell function, adoptive transfer of autologous or allogeneic ex vivo expanded NK cells, establishment of homogeneous NK cell lines using the NK cells of patients with cancer or healthy donors, derivation of NK cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and modification of NK cells with cutting-edge genetic engineering technologies to generate chimeric Ag receptor (CAR)-NK cells. Such NK cell-based immunotherapies are currently reported as being promising anti-tumor strategies that have shown enhanced functional specificity in several clinical trials investigating malignant tumors. Here, we summarize the recent advances in NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies that have focused on providing improved function through the use of the latest genetic engineering technologies. We also discuss the different types of NK cells developed for cancer immunotherapy and present the clinical trials being conducted to test their safety and efficacy.",신민화,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106844621

Pro-inflammatory repertoires, interleukin-1${\beta}$ (IL-1${\beta}$) and nitric oxide (NO), are the main causes of neuro-degenerative disease, particularly in Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is caused by neuronal destruction. Those pro-inflammatory repertoires may lead the brain to chronic inflammatory status, and thus we hypothesized that chronic inflammation would be inhibited when pro-inflammatory repertoires are to be well controlled by inactivating the signal transduction associated with inflammation. Methods: In the present study, we examined whether biphenyl dimethyl dicarboxylate (DDB), an active compound from Schizandra chinensis Baillon, inhibits the NO production by a direct method using Griess reagent and by RT-PCR in the gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and IL-1${\beta}$. Western blots were also used for the analysis of NF-${\kappa}B$ and I${\kappa}B$. Results: In the study, we found that DDB effectively inhibited IL-1${\beta}$ as well as NO production in BV-2 microglial cell, and the translocation of NF-${\kappa}B$ was comparably inhibited in the presence of DDB comparing those to the positive control, lipopolysaccharide. Conclusion: The data suggested that the DDB from Schizandra chinensis Baillon may play an effective role in inhibiting the pro-inflammatory repertoires which may cause neurodegeneration and the results imply that the compound suppresses a cue signal of the microglial activation which can induce the brain pathogenesis such as Alzheimer's disease.",주성수,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105386331
Regulation of Intestinal Homeostasis by Innate Immune Cells,"The intestinal immune system has an ability to distinguish between the microbiota and pathogenic bacteria, and then activate pro-inflammatory pathways against pathogens for host defense while remaining unresponsive to the microbiota and dietary antigens. In the intestine, abnormal activation of innate immunity causes development of several inflammatory disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Thus, activity of innate immunity is finely regulated in the intestine. To date, multiple innate immune cells have been shown to maintain gut homeostasis by preventing inadequate adaptive immune responses in the murine intestine. Additionally, several innate immune subsets, which promote Th1 and Th17 responses and are implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD, have recently been identified in the human intestinal mucosa. The demonstration of both murine and human intestinal innate immune subsets contributing to regulation of adaptive immunity emphasizes the conserved innate immune functions across species and might promote development of the intestinal innate immunity-based clinical therapy.","Kayama, Hisako",2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105126219
"Altered Frequency, Activation, and Clinical Relevance of Circulating Innate and Innate-Like Lymphocytes in Patients With Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis","Alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) is caused by chronic alcohol overconsumption and might be linked to dysregulated immune responses in the gut-liver axis. However, there is a lack of comprehensive research on levels and functions of innate lymphocytes including mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, NKT cells, and NK (NK) cells in ALC patients. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine the levels and function of these cells, evaluate their clinical relevance, and explore their immunologic roles in the pathogenesis of ALC. Peripheral blood samples from ALC patients (n = 31) and healthy controls (HCs, n = 31) were collected. MAIT cells, NKT cells, NK cells, cytokines, CD69, PD-1, and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) levels were measured by flow cytometry. Percentages and numbers of circulating MAIT cells, NKT cells, and NK cells were significantly reduced in ALC patients than in HCs. MAIT cell exhibited increased production of IL-17 and expression levels of CD69, PD-1, and LAG-3. NKT cells displayed decreased production of IFN-γ and IL-4. NK cells showed elevated CD69 expression. Absolute MAIT cell levels were positively correlated with lymphocyte count but negatively correlated with C-reactive protein. In addition, NKT cell levels were negatively correlated with hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, log-transformed absolute MAIT cell levels were negatively correlated with the Age, Bilirubin, INR, and Creatinine score. This study demonstrates that circulating MAIT cells, NKT cells, and NK cells are numerically deficient in ALC patients, and the degree of cytokine production and activation status also changed. Besides, some of their deficiencies are related to several clinical parameters. These findings provide important information about immune responses of ALC patients.",Park Ki-Jeong,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108653057
Vitamin B12-Responsive Pancytopenia Mimicking Myelodysplastic Syndrome,"<P>This study presents 12 patients (7 women and 5 men) with vitamin B(12)-responsive pancytopenia who had discordant laboratory findings and were misdiagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The median hemoglobin level was 6.5 g/dl, and the leukocyte and platelet counts were 2.85 × 10(9)/l and 55.5 × 10(9)/l, respectively. The median serum lactate dehydrogenase level was high (3,204.5 IU/l). The serum vitamin B(12) levels were within normal limits at the initial evaluation, but a serial follow-up of the vitamin B(12) levels revealed either fluctuations or a gradual decrease. The patients were initially diagnosed with MDS and responded rapidly to a 7-day parenteral B(12) treatment with normal complete blood counts (CBCs). We propose that patients suspected to have MDS may suffer from vitamin B(12) deficiency and that this can be revealed by a normalization of CBCs following 7 days of treatment with parental vitamin B(12).</P>","Kim, Myungshin",2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107628284
Reactivation of Silenced WT1 Transgene by Hypomethylating Agents - Implications for in vitro Modeling of Chemoimmunotherapy,"Background: A cell line with transfected Wilms' tumor protein 1 (WT1) is has been used for the preclinical evaluation of novel treatment strategies of WT1 immunotherapy for leukemia due to the lack of appropriate murine leukemia cell line with endogenous WT1. However, silencing of the transgene occurs. Regarding the effects of hypomethylating agents (HMAs) on reactivation of silenced genes, HMAs are considered to be immune enhancers. Methods: We treated murine WT1- transfected C1498 (mWT1-C1498) with increasing doses of decitabine (DAC) and azacitidine (AZA) to analyze their effects on transgene reactivation. Results: DAC and AZA decreased the number of viable cells in a dose- or time-dependent manner. Quantification of WT1 mRNA level was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction after mWT1-C1498 treated with increasing dose of HMA. DAC treatment for 48 h induced 1.4-, 14.6-, and 15.5-fold increment of WT1 mRNA level, compared to untreated sample, at 0.1, 1, and $10{\mu}M$, respectively. Further increment of WT1 expression in the presence of 1 and $10{\mu}M$ DAC was evident at 72 h. AZA treatment also induced up-regulation of mRNA, but not to the same degree as with DAC treatment. The correlation between the incremental increases in WT1 mRNA by DAC was confirmed by Western blot and concomitant down-regulation of WT1 promoter methylation was revealed. Conclusion: The in vitro data show that HMA can induce reactivation of WT1 transgene and that DAC is more effective, at least in mWT1-C1498 cells, which suggests that the combination of DAC and mWT1-C1498 can be used for the development of the experimental model of HMA-combined WT1 immunotherapy targeting leukemia.","Kwon, Yong-Rim",2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105130308
Immune Disorders and Its Correlation with Gut Microbiome,"Allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis and asthma are common hyper-immune disorders in industrialized countries. Along with genetic association, environmental factors and gut microbiota have been suggested as major triggering factors for the development of atopic dermatitis. Numerous studies support the association of hygiene hypothesis in allergic immune disorders that a lack of early childhood exposure to diverse microorganism increases susceptibility to allergic diseases. Among the symbiotic microorganisms (e.g. gut flora or probiotics), probiotics confer health benefits through multiple action mechanisms including modification of immune response in gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Although many human clinical trials and mouse studies demonstrated the beneficial effects of probiotics in diverse immune disorders, this effect is strain specific and needs to apply specific probiotics for specific allergic diseases.

Thapsigargin Increases IL-2 Production in T Cells at Nanomolar Concentrations,"Thapsigargin (TGN) is a potent and selective inhibitor of sarco-endoplasmic Ca2+-ATPase, leading to rapid elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Previous reports have shown that TGN increases the production of various cytokines from macrophages and dendritic cells. Here, we examine the effects of TGN on murine T cells. Nanomolar concentrations of TGN are a significant inducer of IL-2 production with full activity at 50 nM. Micromolar concentrations of TGN, however, are inhibitory to IL-2 production and T cell proliferation. The IL-2 production-inducing activity of TGN is much more prominent when T cells are primed with concanavalin A or anti-CD3 mAb, and is due to the increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. TGN at 50 nM does not affect interferon-gamma or IL-4 production from T cells. Thus, the present study shows that low nanomolar concentrations of TGN could be useful in potentiating IL-2 production from antigen-primed T cells.",김기향,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105913144

Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase is Involved in the Release of High Mobility Group Box 1 Via the Interferon-β Signaling Pathway,"Previously, we have reported that high mobility group box 1(HMGB1), a proinflammatory mediator in sepsis, is released via the IFN-β-mediated JAK/STAT pathway. However, detailed mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, we dissected upstream signaling pathways of HMGB1 release using various molecular biology methods. Here, we found that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase,CaMK) is involved in HMGB1 release by regulating IFN-βproduction. CaMK inhibitor, STO609, treatment inhibits LPS-induced IFN-β production, which is correlated with the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3).
Additionally, we show that CaMK-I plays a major role in IFN-β production although other CaMK members also seem to contribute to this event. Furthermore, the CaMK inhibitor treatment reduced IFN-β production in a murine endotoxemia.
Our results suggest CaMKs contribute to HMGB1 release by enhancing IFN-β production in sepsis.",Lijuan Ma,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103889214
아토피성 피부질환 동물 모델 NC/Nga 생쥐에서 내재면역 T와 B 세포의 변형,"Background: Millions of people in the world are suffering from atopic dermatitis (AD), which is a chronic inflammatory skin disease triggered by Th2 immune responses. The NC/Nga mouse is the most extensively studied animal model of AD. Like human AD, NC/Nga mice demonstrate increased levels of IgE, a hallmark of Th2 immune responses. Adaptive immunity cannot be generated without help of innate immunity. Especially natural killer T (NKT) cells and marginal zone B (MZB) cells have been known to play important roles in linking innate immunity to adaptive immunity. Methods: Through flow cytometric analysis and ELISA assay, we investigated whether these lymphocytes might be altered in number in NC/Nga mice. Results: Our data demonstrated that the number of NKT cells was reduced in NC/Nga mice and IFNγ production by NKT cells upon α-GalCer stimulation decreased to the levels of CD1d KO mice lacking in NKT cells. However, reduction of NKT cells in NC/Nga mice was not due to CD1d expression, which was normal in the thymus. Interestingly, there was a significant increase of CD1dhighB220 cells in the spleen of NC/Nga mice. Further, we confirmed that CD1dhighB220 cells are B cells, not dendritic cells. These CD1dhighB220 B cells show IgMhighCD21highCD23low, a characteristic phenotype of MZB cells. Conclusion: We provide the evidence that there are decreased activities of NKT cells and increased number of MZB cells in the NC/Nga mice. Our findings may thus explain why NC/Nga mice are susceptible to AD.",김정은,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103929372
Regulation of Osteoclast Differentiation by Cytokine Networks,"Cytokines play a pivotal role in maintaining bone homeostasis. Osteoclasts (OCs), the sole bone resorbing cells, are regulated by numerous cytokines. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor and receptor activator of NF-κB ligand play a central role in OC differentiation, which is also termed osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclastogenic cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-11, IL-15, IL-17, IL-23, and IL-34, promote OC differentiation, whereas anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, IL-3, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, IL-27, and IL-33, downregulate OC differentiation. Therefore, dynamic regulation of osteoclastogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines is important in maintaining the balance between bone-resorbing OCs and bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs), which eventually affects bone integrity. This review outlines the osteoclastogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic properties of cytokines with regard to osteoimmunology, and summarizes our current understanding of the roles these cytokines play in osteoclastogenesis.",Dulshara Sachini Amarasekara,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105988293
생쥐 소교세포(BV-2)에서 우르소데옥시콜린산에 의한 iNOS 발현억제,"Background: Inflammation in the brain has known to be associated with the development of a various neurological diseases. The hallmark of neuro-inflammation is the activation of microglia, brain macrophage. Pro-inflammatory compounds including nitric oxide (NO) are the main cause of neuro-degenerative disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is resulted in cell death. Among those pro-inflammatory compounds, NO contributes to the cell death by directly or indirectly. Methods: In the study, we examined whether ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a non-toxic hydrophilic bile acid, inhibits the NO production by a direct method using Griess reagent and by RT-PCR in the gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In signal transduction, we also examined the NF-κB (p65/p50), IKK, and IκB, which are associated with the expression of iNOS gene using western blots. Results: In the present study, we found that UDCA effectively inhibited NO production in BV-2 microglial cell, and NF-κB activation was reduced by suppressing IKK gene expression and by increasing the IκB in cytosol comparing those to the positive control LPS. Conclusion: Taken together, these data suggested that UDCA may play a crucial role in inhibiting the NO production and the results imply that UDCA suppresses a cue signal of the microglial activation via stimulators, such asβ-amyloid peptides which are known to stimulate microglia in AD pathogenesis.",주성수,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103880582
"Characterization of a Novel Gene in the Extended MHC Region of Mouse, NG29/Cd320, a Homolog of the Human CD320","Background: The MHC region of the chromosome contains a
lot of genes involved in immune responses. Here we have investigated
the mouse NG29/Cd320 gene in the centrometrically
extended MHC region of chromosome 17. Methods:
We cloned the NG29 gene by RT-PCR and confirmed the tissue
distribution of its gene expression by northern blot
hybridization. We generated the NG29 gene expression constructs
and polyclonal antibody against the NG29 protein to
perform the immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation and
flow cytometric analysis. Results: The murine NG29 gene
and its human homologue, the CD320/8D6 gene, were similar
in the gene structure and tissue expression patterns. We
cloned the NG29 gene and confirmed its expression in plasma
membrane and intracellular compartments by transfecting
its expresssion constructs into HEK 293T cells. The immunoprecipitation
studies with rabbit polyclonal antibody
raised against the NG29-NusA fusion protein indicated that
NG29 protein was a glycoprotein of about 45 kDa size. A
flow cytometric analysis also showed the NG29 expression
on the surface of Raw 264.7 macrophage cell line. Conclusion:
These findings suggested that NG29 gene in mouse extended
MHC class II region was the orthologue of human
CD320 gene even though human CD320/8D6 gene was located
in non-MHC region, chromosome 19p13.",박효진,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103884186
