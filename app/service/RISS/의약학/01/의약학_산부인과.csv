Methods: This was an explanatory study using the secondary data on Chungnam province from the Fifth Community Health Survey from August 16 to Oct 31, 2012. Variables included in this analysis were education level, poverty, marital status, and residential community for socio-cultural characteristics and subjective health status as an indicator of health inequality. Data were analyzed by x2-test, t-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression. Results: There were gender inequalities and disparities in health, and these inequalities were greater in woman than in man (x2=161.8, p<.001). The impacting factors were education level, poverty, marital status, and residential community, which was accounted for 22.6% of variances of health inequality. Among these variables, gender showed the largest influence in health inequalities. Conclusion: To solve health inequalities, it should be considered gender differences based on social determinants of health. It is necessary to develop long term project based on these results and the social determinants model of World Health Organization.",송미영 ( Mi Young Song ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2118066
"임신후기 여성의 피로, 수면장애 및 임신 스트레스","Purpose: The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between fatigue, sleep disturbance, and gestational stress in women during late stage of pregnancy. Methods: This study was conducted with 113 healthy pregnant women at gestational age greater than 27 weeks who were registered at community health centers and received prenatal care. A structured questionnaire regarding fatigue, sleep disturbance, and gestational stress was used. The data was analyzed using a t-test, an ANOVA, and Pearson correlation coefficients. Results: The subjects with unplanned pregnancies and irregular exercise patterns showed a higher level of fatigue than those with planned pregnancies and regular exercise patterns. Pregnant women with caffeine intake manifested higher levels of gestational stress and sleep disturbance than those without. The levels of sleep disturbance and gestational stress increased as the fatigue levels increased. The fatigue levels increased with increased levels of sleep disturbance. Conclusion: Planned pregnancy, regular exercise patterns, and caffeine intake were related with fatigue, sleep disturbance, and gestational stress in women during late stages of pregnancy. Fatigue, sleep disturbance, and gestational stress had close associations to each other. In the future, such results should guide development of nursing intervention programs for women in late stages of pregnancy.",정미영 ( Mi Young Chung ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19593965

소아청소년 우울증에서의 환경적 위험 인자들과 임상적 의미,"This summary of literature during the past year reviews published studies relating to risk factors for depressive disorders in children and adolescents. Risk factors include environmental toxins, socio-environmental, and genetic factors. As depression has a complex, multifactorial causal mechanism, it is likely that the accumulation and/ or interaction among multiple risk factors lead to depression. Findings related to the result of toxin exposure have been difficult to interpret given that risk factors tend to interact and that higher mental functions are not easily measurable. However, some findings have been consistent. Clinical research data has also shown that the risk for negative outcomes may be modified both by genetic and environmental factors through a gene environment interplay mechanism.",이문수(Moon-Soo Lee),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99794342
주의력결핍 과잉행동장애 아동에서 종합주의력검사의 진단적 유용성,"Background：The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of the Comprehensive Attention Test (CAT) by comparing the results of the continuous performance test (CPT) and the CAT in children and adolescents with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Method：A total of 110 children and adolescents with ADHD (mean age : 11.2±2.9 years, 76 boys) and 36 children and adolescents without ADHD (mean age : 12.0±2.7 years, 25 boys) completed the CAT. We compared the specificity and sensitivity of the CPT and CAT at two different cut-off points via the McNemar test. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) between the two groups were compared using Medcalc software.
Results：The sensitivity and specificity of the CPT were .419 and .806, respectively.

고위험 임신의 외래 산전진찰시 고려사항,"A high-risk pregnancy means a pregnancy with a high probability of adverse pregnancy outcomes for the pregnant woman and fetus, and is applicable when there are risk factors for high-risk pregnancy that can affect pregnancy outcomes. Risk factors involved in high-risk pregnancy include the age of the pregnant woman, medical/surgical diseases that existed before pregnancy, internal/surgical diseases that occurred during pregnancy, obstetric diseases, and diseases that occurred during pregnancy. The most common risk factor for high-risk pregnancies is older pregnancies, such as those over 35 years at the time of delivery, and those over 40 years are at high risk of miscarriage and chromosomal disorders. In the case of elderly mothers, the prevalence of underlying diseases is high, and the occurrence of hypertensive diseases and diabetes during pregnancy increases. Due to the aging of domestic mothers, the rate of high-risk pregnancies is increasing, and more effort is required for prenatal care for them compared to low-risk mothers.

인공임신중절과 관련된 윤리학적 논쟁과 문제 분석,"Over one million cases of the induced abortion have been conducted annually in Korea. Among those cases, most of all were illegally done, but this has not been addressed in the literature. While Korean Nurse Association Code of Ethics presents the respect for life as one of the basic ideology, it was not dealt enough in nursing education.
The purposes of the study were to activate the debate on the issues related to an induced abortion ; to introduce the related ethical theories ; and to seek the solution of the ethical problems, which will eventually result in establishing the morality of nursing practice.
The ethical theories of an induced abortion have traditionally addressed two extreme perspectives ; the conservatives who emphasize the sanctity of human life and the right of life that will never ethically allow the killing fetus ; and the liberalists who insist the right to choice for women to control their body. Since these extreme theories has not been helpful to solve the ethical problems, the recent trend is leading to the modified theories both from conservative and liberal perspectives. The examples of the theories are the potentiality of fetus (Singer, 1993), the obligation of women to serve their body to fetus (Held, 1987), the Replacement theory (Callahan, 1987), and the Principle of Caring (Gilligan, 1982).
The study conducted the indepth interviews with 17 women who experienced the induced abortion and the 6 cases were selected to be analyzed. The cases were analyzed and interpreted by using an integrated case method, which was combined of the New Casuisty (Jonsen & Toulmin, 1988 ; Jonsen, 1991) and the Specified Principlism (Richardson, 1990 ; Degrazia, 1992).
The result of analysis revealed three types of ethical problems ; (1) the responsibility of taking care of the baby to be born (2) the fear for the condition of the fetus, and (3) the choice of induced abortion as the method of birth control. The findings also revealed the related ethical principles for various situations ; the principle of caring was used for choosing an induced abortion by the subjects ; the principles of the potentiality of fetus and the obligation of women to serve their body were for the consideration for the life of fetus ; and the principle of replacement was utilized for the right to choice for women.
The ethical principles related to an induced abortion introduced in the study provided the way to solve the moral problems by applying to the clinical situations for nurses. The study also revealed the possibility of modifying the current ethical theories from the method of applying the principles to the various situations in the study. The modified theories would be more useful to guide the clinical practice with similar ethical problems.",엄영란,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2118086

ADHD 환자에 대한 OROS-Methylphenidate 약물치료의 부작용과 관련요인들에 대한 연구,"Objectives：The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the clinical and demographic variables such as body weight, dosage, family history of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and psychiatric co-morbidity on the side-effects of OROS-Methylphenidate (OROS-MPH), and to evaluate the relationship between drug response and side effect severity.
Methods：A total of 144 children (ages 6-18) with diagnosed ADHD were treated with OROS-MPH. Children were examined at baseline and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks of each treatment condition. The stimulant drug side effect rating scale (SERS), pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) were evaluated to assess side effect profiles. Changes in these parameters from baseline were examined and analyzed.
Results：Anorexia (30.95%) and insomnia (13.10%) were the most commonly reported side effects during this study. Insomnia and loss of appetite score increased at one week follow-up, but was sustained or decreased as treatment progressed. Small but significant increases in pulse rate and diastolic blood pressure were observed during treatment；however, no clinically meaningful changes in ECG parameters were noted during the study. Low body weight, high dosage of OROS-MPH, and family history of ADHD were associated with cardiovascular side effect. In contrast, there was no significant relationship between OROS-MPH treatment response and the severity of side effect and no difference resulted between the responder and non-responder groups with respect to OROS-MPH dosage in the 12 weeks of follow-up.
Conclusion：To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first Korean study to investigate comprehensive side effect profiles and their correlates in OROS-MPH treatment for ADHD children. OROS-MPH was well tolerated with no clinically significant side effects during the treatment period. In conclusion, low body weight, high dosage of OROSMPH, and family history of ADHD could be used as predictive factors in increasing pulse rate and blood pressure.",김진선(Jin-Sun Kim),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105616820

성조숙증 아동의 임상 및 내분비 검사의 특징,"Purpose : Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of secondary sexual characteristics before 8 year of age in girls and 9 year in boys. The purpose of this study is to analyze the spectrum of diagnoses made in a consecutive group of children referred for signs of precocious puberty and evaluate the clinical and endocrinologic characteristics of patients with precocious puberty.
Methods : The charts of all 948 children referred for evaluation of signs of precocious puberty between January 2003 and June 2007 in several referral centers were reviewed. Clinical features including age of onset, presenting symptoms, yearly growth rate, bone age advancement, weight, height, and body mass index were analysed and endocrine investigations included basal and gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)-stimulated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) as well as sex hormones.
Results : Of the 948 children referred for signs of precocious puberty, 915 (96.5%) were female and 33 (3.5%) were male. The final diagnoses made were early puberty (39%), premature thelarche (31%), true precocious puberty (27%) and precocious pseudopuberty (1%). The increases in yearly growth rate and bone age advancement were significant in true precious puberty group (P<0.05). The height and weight standard deviation score were significantly increased in true precious puberty and premature thelarche group compared to the average level according to gender and age (P<0.05). Endocrinologic studies showed that the level of basal LH, basal estradiol and GnRH-stimulated peak LH, peak FSH, peak LH/basal LH, peak FSH/basal FSH, peak LH/peak FSH ratio was all significantly higher in true precicous puberty group and early puberty group when compared to premature thelarche group (P<0.05). Neurogenic true precocious puberty among true precocious puberty was more common in boys (3 out of 7, 42.8%) than in girls (27 out of 253, 10.7%). Endocrinologic studies did not show any difference between idiopathic precocious puberty and neurogenic precocious puberty.
Conclusion : The result of this study showed the proportion of true precocious puberty among the children referred for early pubertal signs was rather high. Collectively assessing all available data including detailed history, growth records, physical findings, laboratory studies and radiological imaging is important in the evaluation of a child with concerns of early pubertal maturation. Foregoing extensive studies regarding incidence and causes of true precocious puberty should be needed.",김호성,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82491853

Results: Mean score for breastfeeding knowledge was 18.34±4.63, for breastfeeding attitude was 3.61±0.51, and for barriers to breastfeeding was 13.35±1.08. The breastfeeding practice rate was 27.8% when twins were two months old. The breastfeeding knowledge was significantly different depending on mother`s occupa-tion, number of children, utilization of postpartum caretaker, and age of the children. There were significant differ-ences in the breastfeeding attitude depending on gestational week of twins, planned length of the breastfeeding, and decision period for the breastfeeding. The practice of the breastfeeding was significantly different depending on the number of children. Factors influencing the breastfeeding practice were the breastfeeding attitude (p<.05), age of mother (p<.01), and the number of children (p<.01). Conclusion: An educational program and expert-led sup-portive system that is designed for twins are necessary, and they need to be included in prenatal care in order to have positive attitude for the breastfeeding as well as to breastfeed successfully.",심재인 ( Shim Jae In ),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100133914
신생아 태변흡인증후군에서 중증도 예측인자로써 염증성 사이토카인의 효용성,"Objective: Respiratory failure caused by the inflammatory response to meconium aspiration is an important known pathophysiological mechanism of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS). This study investigated the inflammatory cytokines in patients with MAS, the clinical severity of MAS, and the incidence of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) to verity the utility of inflammatory cytokines as predictors of MAS severity.
Methods: A prospective study was conducted on 45 patients at the gestational age of 35 weeks or more who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit at Dong-A University Hospital due to MAS during the period from November 2018 to February 2021 and agreed to participate. From the serum test performed at admission, the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, IL-12, and interferon-γ), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10), and related inflammatory cytokines (IL-21 and IL-23) and a complement (C5a), were estimated, and the data were comparatively analyzed with the clinical severity (mild, moderate, severe) and the incidence of PPHN.
Results: The clinical severity of the patients was mild in 16 (35.6%), moderate in 16 (35.6%), and severe in 13 (28.9%). PPHN was identified in seven patients (15.6%), and the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 increased significantly with increased clinical severity in PPHN patients.
Conclusion: This implied an important role of IL-6 and IL-10 as predictors of early MAS severity. These results show that the clinical severity and development of PPHN can be predicted at an early stage of MAS, thereby improving the prognosis of respiratory and neurological conditions.",이선영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639603
난임 시술로 임신된 임산부와 자연 임산부의 출산 시 통증 및 태아애착행위 비교연구,"Purpose: This study was a comparative study to understand the levels of anxiety, pain and maternal-fetal attachment between women who became pregnant after infertility treatment and became pregnant naturally. Methods: This study used a comparative survey design. Data were collected by 50 couples of natural pregnancy and of who became pregnant after infertility treatment who visited delivery room in C Medical hospital, Seoul. These couples were to have first baby, and cervix dilatation of women was less than 3 cm regardless of diagnosis. Results: The score of anxiety of infertile women was significantly higher than that of naturally pregnant women; however, that of spouses showed no difference. The pain score for infertile women was significantly higher in both the active and transition phases. Pain scores that reported by their spouses did not show differences in either phase. The score of maternal-fetal attachment showed no difference between two groups of women. Conclusion: The result showed the importance of nursing intervention to reduce women``s anxiety and pain, through both antenatal-childbirth education programs and assertive nursing interventions. It is necessary to develop and evaluate new intervention which would be more effective for reducing pain and anxiety for couples who became pregnant after infertility treatment.",윤희자 ( Hee Ja Yoon ),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99887896
선행 제왕절개술이 동반된 전치 태반 임신부의 대량 출혈 예측 모델,"Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a model to predict massive hemorrhage during cesarean section in pregnant women of previous cesarean section with placenta previa. Based on this model, we developed an equation of massive hemorrhage in pregnant women of previous cesarean section with placenta previa.
Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 218 patients with previous cesarean section and placenta previa who underwent cesarean section from January 2011 to December 2021. Massive hemorrhage was defined as a blood loss exceeding 2,000 mL during operation. The data was analyzed by independent t-test, Pearson chi-squared test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to develop a predictive model and identify factors predictive for massive hemorrhage.
Results: A total of 53 patients (24.3%) had massive hemorrhage. Number of parity, anterior placenta, presence of lacuna, abnormalities of uterine serosa-bladder interface, extension of placenta into myometrium, serosa and bladder were selected predictive factors to develop a model to predict massive hemorrhage. Based on this model, an equation was developed and tested for performance. This model using five predictive factors yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.886 (95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.93).
Conclusion: Application of this predictive model may provide an effective prediction of massive hemorrhage in patients of previous cesarean section with placenta previa. Adequate preoperative preparation, intraoperative strategies, postoperative care can be indicated based on this model.",최명균,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82704847
음악치료가 Paclitaxel 항암화학요법을 받는 부인암 환자의 말초 신경병성 통증 및 불안에 미치는 효과,"Purpose: This study was to investigate the effect of music therapy as intervention on peripheral neuropathic pain and anxiety of gynecologic cancer patients who were undergoing paclitaxel chemotherapy. Methods: Hospitalized 62 patients were assigned to an experimental group (n=30) and a control group (n=33) in this quasi-experimental study. The experimental group participated in music therapy that includes listening, singing and song writing during 1 hour. The peripheral neuropathic pain, anxiety and depression were examined as pre-intervention evaluation by using pain scale, anxiety scale (20 questions) and depression scale (20 questions) in both groups. There were no further treatments for the control group while the experimental group involved in music therapy. The peripheral neuropathic pain and anxiety were evaluated in both groups as post-intervention evaluation. Results: Outcomes were verified through hypothesis testing. The level of peripheral neuropathic pain and anxiety in the experimental group was decreased, compared to the control group. Conclusion: According to the study, music therapy is a beneficial intervention that reduces peripheral neuropathic pain and anxiety in gynecologic cancer patients. These findings are ncouraging and suggest that music therapy can be applied as an effective intervention for minimizing chemotherapy related symptoms.",노기옥 ( Gie Ok Noh ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3014124
