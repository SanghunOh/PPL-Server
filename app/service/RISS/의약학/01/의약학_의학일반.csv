의학에서 인공지능 도입의 현재와 미래,"The Alpha Go event of 2016 reflects today's feelings mixed with anxiety and anticipation about Artificial intelligence(AI). AI was about only to mimic a single human nerve, but now it has reached a level that can simulate a human neural network. As computing power increases exponentially, AI has become more applicable and has entered the medical field. If the accuracy of the AI based diagnosis is higher than that of the human, the possibility of transferring the authority of diagnosis from human to AI based diagnosis is likely to be the choice of the Evidence Based Medicine. Furthermore, when the diagnosis or treatment of AI proves to be superior or more accurate than a human physician, the normative level of the physician's duty of care will change. If so, will AI be perceived as a human being or a subject of medical practice? It will be a question whether AI can become a legal entity that can be responsible for the wrongdoing. In the case of automobiles in which modern technology is integrated and operated in a complex way, even if problems arise in the process of intelligent work that is based on decision making, the service or automobile is not responsible for the accident on its own. In other words, if the machine does not know exactly what the human will is, or if the machine can not perform correctly, the responsibility for the accident is mainly the manufacturer. It is difficult to define intelligence as it is now, and it is more difficult and ambiguous to define AI. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain logical persuasiveness in discussing the legal subjecthood of AI in the current state. On the other hand, the benefits expected from the introduction of AI medicine include avoiding human error, reducing costs, improving quality of care, and preventing health inequalities. However, as long as AI will bring more light into the future, its shadow can also become darker. As the spread of artificial intelligence dissemination, layperson who do not know programming will be able to participate in patching and spreading of fake information, and wrong medical information can be spread more easily and quickly through AI service. In addition, though the things, such as medical care, nursing, filling prescription or medication instruction, that are regarded as only human being can do are done by AI, and if it is hard to distinguish by whom it has been done, then the mutual relationship of human being and its value will inevitably weakened. Furthermore, AI still remains at the level of simulating some functions of human intelligence, if AI become similar to the god of self existence and controls human life with its free will, we need to reconsider whether it is right to continue to develop these technologies.",동재준,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99667585

소아청소년 1형 당뇨병 환자에서 연속혈당측정기와 인슐린펌프의 사용,"Type 1 diabetes requires lifelong insulin therapy because insulin-secretion capability is diminished. Glycemic control and glucose monitoring are important to prevent type 1 diabetes complications. Diabetes technologies have developed rapidly; continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) are now common and greatly aid glycemic control, especially in children and adolescents. The National Health Insurance Service has provided partial reimbursements for both CGM and CSII devices since 2019 and 2020, respectively; the devices are thus expected to become more popular. CGM reduces the frequency of hypoglycemia and the level of glycated hemoglobin. CSII affords more precise glycemic control than multi- dose insulin therapy. CSII showed reduced frequency of hypoglycemia and improved metabolic outcome without an increase in the body mass index z-score. Technological advancement of combined CGM and CSII will eventually serve as an artificial pancreas.

In Korea, the SARS-CoV-2 testing has started quickly from February 2020 to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, I would like to introduce the characteristics of coronavirus and PCR test methods that play a large role in COVID-19 quarantine measures. Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR is one of the molecular diagnostic method, and it detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA by amplifying SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene and E (envelope) gene at the same time. Real-time RT-PCR is currently the most reliable test that confirming COVID-19 and is in use worldwide. Real-time RT-PCR test is recommended for COVID-19 confirmatory diagnosis in Korea, but this test requires dedicated equipment, reagents, experienced technicians and laboratory medicine specialists, and it takes about a few hours to a day to report. Rapid molecular testing results in one to two hours with a simple procedure. Antigen test is less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR and can only be used as a secondary role of diagnosis.

국내 노인 간호연구 분석,"This study was done to analyze the trends in research and to suggest future directions for nursing research on nursing care for elderly people in Korea. Eighty-eight studies in gerontological nursing between 1999 and 2003 were reviewed. The author examined research design, participants, major concepts, nursing interventions, and related variables associated with gerontological nursing.
The findings of the analysis are summarized as follows:
1. The most popular research design was quantitative design (83.0%) including surveys, experimental, correlation, and comparative studies. Qualitative studies accounted for only 7.9% of the total.
2. Most participants were elderly (79.5%). Major concepts studied were mental and physical health.
3. There were many factors influencing nursing of elderly people. In 14 experimental studies, the most frequent nursing interventions were exercise programs and music therapy. In 31 correlation studies, factors such as social support, health status, depression, and self-efficacy were found to correlate with nursing interventions.
The following issues are suggested for future studies.
1. Future research is needed for nursing interventions and program development.

의료 3D 프린팅 기술의 전망 및 소아치과분야에서의 활용,"One of the fields to which the 3D printing technology can be applied is the field of medicine. Recently, the application of 3D printing technology to the bio-medical field has been gradually increasing with the commercializing of the bio-compatible or bio-degradable materials. The technology is currently contributing to the biomedical field by reducing times required for operations or minimizing adverse effects through preoperative identification of post-surgical consequences or model surgery with artificial bones and organs. This technology also enables the production of customized biomedical auxiliary products like hearing aids or artificial legs etc. For the field of dentistry, the 3D printing technology is also expected to elevate the level of dental treatment by making the customized orthodontic models, crown, bridge, inlay, and surgical guides for implant and surgery. However, issues remaining unidentified or incomplete in printing materials, modeling technology, software technology associated with CAD, verification of bio-stability and bio-effectiveness of materials or in compatibility and standardization of the technology are yet to be solved or be clarified for the full-scale application of the 3D printing technology, thus, it seems such issues should be resolved through further studies.",이상호,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107183460
종합병원 간호사의 노인간호 스트레스와 노인간호수행과의 관계에서 공감과 회복 탄력성의 조절된 조절효과,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether empathy and resilience moderate the relationship between geriatric care-related stress and geriatric nursing practice among secondary hospital nurses. Methods: Data were collected from three secondary hospitals in J province from July 20, 2022, to August 10, 2022. Nurses with at least three months of employment were convenience sampled, and a structured questionnaire was used. A total of 218 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The collected data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 software. Results: Geriatric nursing practice was significantly positively correlated with geriatric carerelated stress, empathy, and resilience. Empathy moderated the effects of geriatric care-related stress on geriatric nursing practice, and this moderating effect was re-moderated by resilience (moderated moderation effect). In other words, nurses with high resilience and empathy tended to show stronger geriatric nursing practice even with elevated geriatric care-related stress. Conversely, nurses with high resilience and low empathy tended to show weaker geriatric nursing practice with increasing geriatric care-related stress. Conclusion: These results highlight the need for multilateral efforts to reduce nurses’ stress related to geriatric care and enhance their empathy and resilience, ultimately promoting geriatric nursing practice. This study has important implications for nursing practice. Specifically, it is the first to confirm a moderated moderation effect of empathy and resilience on the relationship between geriatric care-related stress and geriatric nursing practice among nurses. Subsequent studies should identify whether other factors moderate the relationship between geriatric care-related stress and geriatric nursing practice.",최영숙(Young Suk Choe),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3080326
한국인 직무 스트레스 측정도구의 개발 및 표준화,"Background and Purposes: Over the past three decades, numerous studies performed in Korea have reported that job stress is a determinant risk factor for chronic diseases and work disability. Every society has its own culture and occupational climate particular to their organizations, and hence experiences different occupational stress. An occupational stress measurement tool therefore needs to be developed to estimate it objectively. The purpose of this study is to develop and standardize the Korean Occupational Stress Scale (KOSS) which is considered to be unique and specific occupational stressors in Korean employees.
Subjects and Methods: Data were obtained from the National Study for Development and Standardization of Occupational Stress (NSDSOS Project: 2002-2004). A total of 12,631 employees from a nationwide sample proportional to the Korean Standard Industrial Classification and the Korean Standard Occupational Classification were administered. The KOSS was developed for 2 years (2002-2004). In the first year, we collected 255 items from the most popular job stress measurement tools such as JCQ, ERI, NIOSH and OSI, and 44 items derived from the a qualitative study (depth interview). Forty-three items of KOSS, in the second year, were retained for use in the final version of the KOSS by using Delphi and factor analysis. Items were scored using conventional 1-2-3-4 Likert scores for the response categories.
Results: We developed eight subscales by using factor analysis and validation process: physical environment (3 items), job demand (8 items), insufficient job control (5 items), interpersonal conflict (4 items), job insecurity (6 items), organizational system (7 items), lack of reward (6 items), and occupational climate (4 items). Together they explained 50.0% of total variance. Internal consistency alpha scores were ranged from 0.51 to 0.82. Twenty-four items of the short form of the KOSS (KOSS-SF) were also developed to estimate job stress in the work setting. Because the levels of the subscales of occupational stress were gender dependent, gender-specific standard norms for both the 43-item full version and the 24-item short form using a quartile for the subscales of KOSS were presented.
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that KOSS might be an appropriate measurement scale to estimate occupational stress of Korean employees. Further and more detailed study needs to be conducted to improve the validity of this scale.",장세진,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2075185
