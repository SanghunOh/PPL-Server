However, there should be a safe limit of lenthening, which might recollect the classical one stage lengthening with bone graft. Nerve and muscle changes are the main concern of most investigators. But the changes of blood flow might be the first step in determining the method of lengthing in certain clinical cases, especially in hand and foot.
This study investigated the changes of blood flow in relation to the percentage of lengthening of the Sprague-Dawley rat's tibia by one stage bone lengthenig. Lengthening procedure was devided into 4 stages, Stage 0(0% lengthened initial status),Stage I(12.5% lengthened status), Stage II(25% lengthened state) and finally Stage III(31.25% lengthened stage) to make it close to the clinical situation of one stage lengthening. 15 minutes went for each stage including 15 seconds of acute lengthening at the beginning of every stage. Blood flow on the dorsum of the foot were measured every minute and changes were recorded as ratios of measured flow to that of Stage 0.
The changes of blood flow in Stage I[0.79±0.117(mean±SD)] did not appear to affect the circulation. Changes in Stage II[0.16±0.002(mean±SD)] might compromise the distal circulation, but circulation was effective enough to maintain a viable skin flap. Stage III[0.016±0.023(mean±SD)] showed definite changes beyond the point of safety.
Though an animal experiment, these results might bear author's suggestion that in some clinical cases one stage lengthening technique can find its place as long as careful monitoring of blood flow is secured.",권성택,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013054
욕창치료에 대한 임상적 고찰,"The pressure sore is a common clinical problem in patient of spinal cord injury or long term comatous patient. These patients have frequently required long term hospitalization, careful attention to local wound care and dietary suppliment and time consuming operation. Author reviewed 17 patients who had suffered from pressure sore and treated by surgery in Nativonal Medical Center for recent 3 years.
The result of clinical evaluation was as followings:
1. The ratio between male & female patient was 13:4
2. The incidence according to age group was highest in 3rd decade.
3. The trauma was the highest etiologic factor, the ratio of trauma to total case was 10/17
4. The total number of pressure sores was 21 cases in those 17 patients.
5. Locations of pressure sores was as following: sacrum (14 case), greater trochanter (5 case), ischium (2 cases).
6. Ten cases of pressure sores were treated by myocutaneous flap and eleven cases were treated by randdom pattern flap. Performed myocutaneous flaps were as following: gluteus maximus myocutaneous flaps (6 cases), tensor fascia lata myocutaneous flap (2 cases), vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap (2 cases).
7. The postoperative complication rate was significantly decreased and the postoperative period of hospitalization was much reduced in patients of myocutaneous flap than that of random pattern flap.",김현철,1986,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104556520
안면 비대칭 환자에 있어서 관골 확대술,"A new osteotomy technique has been used to correct the hypoplasia of the malar complex and the lateral orbital rim, which are commonly seen in patients with hemifacial microsomia and postradiation hypoplasia.
Through a upper vestibular buccal incision, the zygomatic body and the lateral orbital rim are dissected subperiosteally with positive identification of the infraorbital nerve.
A straight osteotomy is performed from the notch on inferior border of the lateral maxilla to the notch on the lateral orbital rim just lateral to the frontozygomatic suture using a reciprocating saw and the osteotomized lateral orbital zygomatic complex is pivoted laterally to achieve symmetric facial contour. Bone grafts or hydroxyapatite blocks are then inserted into the bone gap and the rigid fixation by a miniplate and screws is done. When the additional anterior projection of the malar area is necessary, onlay bone graft, usually cranial bone, is employed to improve the facial contour.
From August, 1988 to February, 1993, we used this technique in 16 patients with hemifacial microsomia,, 2 patients with postradiation hypoplasia of malar complex, 2 patients with posttraumatic facial asymmetry and 1 patient with congenital facial cleft. Patient's satisfaction has been excellent and there has been no significant complication.
Follow-up of more than 4 years showed no relapse and no evidence of the bony resorption.",김동일,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013520
모발 이식술을 이용한 탈모증의 치료,"The increasingly successful results of hair restoration surgery in the last years have developed the interest and the confidence of patients and it is the most frequently performed esthetic surgery among male patients. Currently, Various kinds of techniques for hair restoration surgery including hair transplantation, scalp reduction, and scalp flaps are performed in our clinic. Among these, hair transplantation is the basic ant the most popular procedure, which can be performed not only by itself but also in conjunction with other procedures.
123 consecutives cases of hair transplantations were performed from Jan. 1995 to Feb. 1996 for male pattern baldness, traumatic alopecia, and female pattern baldness under patient base. The authors introduced a new classification for male pattern baldness, which are the type M, O, C, U, M-O, and C-O after alphabet to make simple and easy for clinical application. The ancillary procedures were scalp reduction, preauricular flap, and scalp expansion. An ellipsis of hair bearing scalp taken from the occipital area was Sliced into slit-, mega-, mini-, and micro-grafts. The survival rate of the grafts was over 90% with minimal complications. This hair transplantation technique enabled us to achieve a good density and more natural looking hair with avoidance of cobble stoning and apparent scar.",김성욱,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014079
상악 하악 돌출증의 치료,"Bimaxillary protrusion implies protrusion of the mandibular incisor teeth associated whith maxillary protrusion.
Abnormal growth of the craniofacial structures may produce bimaxillary dental protrusion with severe dental and facial disharmony.
In this condition, both the maxillary and mandibular incisor teeth are significantly more procumbent on their bony bases than are normal teeth. Bimaxillary protrusion is a relative designation, as the dentoalveolar prominence results from overdevelopment of the maxillary and mandibular arches or from underdevelopment of the other skeletal components.
Lip incompeteucy, ""receding chin effect""and loss of labiomental curve are frequently observed in these patients.
The majority of the adult bimaxillary dental protrusions can be treated by orthodontics in 24 to 30 months by extracting 4 first premolars and moving the anterior teeth posteriorly.
But satisfactory facial harmony and balance can be restored by surgical-ortho-dontic procedures when improvement in facial harmony cannot be achieved through orthodontic therapy alone or when an adult patient is unwilling to accept the required appliande therapy.
Moreover, orthognatic surgery has an advantage over orthodontic because the former moves the basal bone with the dental component, whereas the latter limits itself to the dentoalveolar segment only.
A combination of surgery performed with orthodontics was successful in treating a pateint who had bimaxillary dental protrusion.
Functionally balanced occlusion with facial balance and harmony was achieved by intraoral surgery in the anterior part of the jaws and orthodontic treatment
Hereby, we present a case of bimacillary protrusion in young female who has been treated successfully by premolar setback osteotomy.",김진환,1985,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014152
여성성기의 재건,"The attempts to reconstruct the vagina had been made since the ancient times, and it has been very fascinating field of medical history. According to the ""history of attempts to form a vagina"" by Goldwyn, the vaginal atresia was first described in detail by Celsus and Soranus in Roman period. In the nineteenth century, Warren operated successfully on 3 patients with vaginal atresia.
In the second half of the nineteenth century, the use of inlay split-skin grafting was pioneered by Robert Abbe. In the twentieth century, the use of inlay grafts were popularized by Gilles and McIndoe. Sneguireff described success with transposing a loop of intestine, and Frank devised a simple non-surgical technique of pressure and dilatation.
The development of sex reassignment operation in transexualism has brought more various methods of vaginoplasty, which include penile skin inversion surgery, Singapore flap,penoscrotal inversion vaginoplasty, and free flap vaginoplasty.
There is no single ideal method of vaginoplasty that can be chosen in all cases, but it can be individualized according to the condition of the patients and preference of the surgeon.
We can summarize the methods of vaginoplasty based on our clinical experience as follows.
1. In the cases of congenital agenesis, there are many choices according to the conditions of the patients, which include dilatation method, full-thickness skin grafting, tissue expansion, and rectosigmoid vaginoplasty.
2. in the patients of transsexualism in whom their the penis and scrotum are well preserved, the penoscrotal skin inversion flap is the method of choice.
3. The restosihmoid flap or Pudendal thigh flap is the preferred methods in transsexualism who had their penis and scrotum being already resected or in the intersexualism.
4. The gracilis myocutaneous flap or the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap are the methods of choice in vaginoplasty after tumor resection or radiation therapy.",정영하,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013428
음경연장 및 확대성형술,"Although many patients with micorpenis prefer to have augmentation phalloplasty, there are few reports on augmentation phalloplasty. Lengthening of micropenis can be achieved by partial separation of penile crura from pubo-ischial rami with division of suspensory ligament. Augmentation of width of penis can be achieved by autogenous dermofat graft.
23 patients with congenital micropenis and one patient with acquried micropenis due to dog bite were treated with above methods. The sensation and erect function of penis were remained quite normal.

The vertical orbicularis oculi muscle turn-over procedure for the correction of paralytic ectropion of the lower eyelid,"Background Static reconstruction surgery that tightens the tension of the inferior tarsus, thereby raising the lax lower eyelid, is a common treatment for paralytic ectropion of the lower eyelid. We present one such operative procedure, in which an orbicularis oculi muscle flap was used. Methods The surgical technique involves partial resection of the tarsus and the skin, as well as a superior-based orbicularis oculi muscle flap that is sutured to the firm tissue present on the Whitnall tubercle. The muscle flap is approximately 7 mm in width and 15 mm in length, with a superior pedicle that is attached to the tarsus at the medial point of the resected tarsus. The procedure results in contact between the ocular surface and the lower eyelid. Results The procedure was performed in 11 patients with lower eyelid ectropion due to facial paralysis. Ten cases showed a favorable outcome following surgery, with stable results seen over an average follow-up period of 4.5 years. In one case, recurrence of ectropion was observed 2 months after surgery due to an insufficient correction, and the patient required repeat surgery. Conclusions The orbicularis oculi muscle flap was an effective means of suspension and was able to maintain long-term traction tension. This procedure can therefore be considered a favorable treatment option for lower eyelid ectropion due to facial paralysis.","Azuma, Ryuichi",2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013259
Somatosensory evoked potentials are abnormal with plagiocephaly,"Background: Deformational plagiocephaly is usually managed conservatively, as it tends to improve over time and with the use of conservative measures. However, before the year 2017 we operated on patients with severe plagiocephaly and neurological symptoms at the Helsinki Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Center. Methods: Of the 20 infants with severe deformational plagiocephaly and neurological symptoms referred to us between 2014 and 2016, 10 underwent cranioplasty open reshaping of the posterior cranial vault. The parents of the last 10 patients were given information on the natural history of the condition and the patients were followed up with an outpatient protocol. The aim of this study was to gain information on the brain electrophysiology and recovery of patients after total cranial vault reconstruction by measuring the electroencephalogram (EEG) somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP; median nerve). Results: Of the 10 participants in the operation arm, six had abnormal SEP at least on the affected cerebral hemisphere and all SEPs were recorded as normal when controlled postoperatively. In the follow-up arm, eight out of 10 participants had abnormal SEP at the age of approximately 24 months, and all had normalized SEPs at control visits. Conclusion: Our data suggest that cranioplasty open reshaping of the posterior cranial vault did not affect abnormal SEP-EEG recordings. We have abandoned the operations in deformational plagiocephaly patients due to findings suggesting that expanding cranioplasty is not beneficial for brain function in this patient group.","Harma, Maiju",2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105316355
Blink reflex changes and sensory perception in infraorbital nerve-innervated areas following zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures,"Background Infraorbital nerve dysfunction is commonly reported after zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures. We evaluated sensory changes in four designated areas (eyelid, nose, zygoma, and lip) innervated by the infraorbital nerve. This evaluation was conducted using the static two-point discrimination test and the vibration threshold test. We assessed the diagnostic significance of the blink reflex in patients with infraorbital nerve dysfunction. Methods This study included 18 patients, all of whom complained of some degree of infraorbital nerve dysfunction preoperatively. A visual analog scale, the infraorbital blink reflex, static two-point discrimination, and the vibration threshold were assessed preoperatively, at 1 month postoperatively (T1), and at a final follow-up that took place at least 4 months postoperatively (T4). The results were analyzed using a multilevel generalized linear mixed model. Results Scores on the visual analog scale significantly improved at T1 and T4. The infraorbital blink reflex significantly improved at T4. Visual analog scale scores improved more rapidly than the infraorbital blink reflex. Two-point discrimination significantly improved in all areas at T4, and the vibration perception threshold significantly improved in the eyelid at T4. Conclusions Recovery of the infraorbital blink reflex reflected the recovery of infraorbital nerve dysfunction. We also determined that the lip tended to recover later than the other areas innervated by the infraorbital nerve.","Park, Young Sook",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108109663
여성 성전환수술을 받은 환자의 호르몬 정량분석,"Transgender is the severe type of gender identity disorder. The prevalence rate of transgender is reported to occur to about 1 out of 50,000 men, and about 1 out of 10,000 women. As for Korea, it is estimated to have about 1400 transgender patients. Lately, not only the numbers of them are increasing but also they are influencing our society increasingly. As for female transgender patients, they take female hormone for a long term before and even after the operation to maintain their physical identity of female. We have analyzed insulin like growth factor-1(IGF-1), insulin like growth factor protein binding-3(IGFBP-3), female hormone, male hormone and thyroid hormone in female transgender patients who have undergone the gender reassignment operation. We examined the changes of hormone level due to having female hormone steadily, and also examined how the steady use of the hormone could affect body organs. As for IGF-1, it showed significantly low in the female transgender group compared to control (319.30±37.4 vs 539±55.0, p<0.05). As for IGFBP-3, there was no significant difference (2859±200.3 vs 2607±262.5, p>0.05). As for female hormone, there was no significant differences in FSH(13.42 ±13.8 vs 8.95±3.5, p>0.05), estradiol(104.41±97.1 vs 121.68±60.2, p>0.05), and LH(7.62±5.6 vs 7.4±3.3, p>0.05). Even in comparison of testosterone, there was no significant differences(0.23±0.09 vs 0.33± 1.33, p>0.05). As for thyroid hormone, there was no significant differences in TSH and free T4(1.34±0.94 vs 1.71±0.12, 1.4±0.37 vs 1.46±0.17, p>0.05).Therefore, this study concludes that apart from the decreased level of IGF-1, the possible endocrine side- effect problem due to female hormone seems to be low because there was no differences of female, male, and thyroid hormone level compared with normal female. Further study will be required in metabolic change including bone metabolism occurred by decrease level of IGF-I.",박정민,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107140907
미세혈관 수술후 Urokinase투여효과에 관한 실험적 연구,"However, even the most technically perfect anastomosis can neither eliminate the damage which microneedles cause on the vascular endothelium nor foreign body reaction to the suture material.
Thrombosis developed at the suture site and regressed if the stimulus for the thrombosis is not severe.
Partial thrombosis was inevitable after microvascular anastomosis.
Since systemic thrombolytic drugs were used initially in the management of pulmonary emboli, urokinase were also used in prevention of thrombolysis and thrombolysis after microvascular anastomsis.
This experimental study includes the effect of urokinase on the microvascular anastomosis in rabbits.
The patency was observed, and platelet count, fibinogen, prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastim time were examined.
In the case of thromboses, the anastomotic sites were resected and examined microscopically.
The results were as follow;
1. The patency rate was increased 15 percent in experimental group than control group.
2. There were no differences in platelet count and the prothrombine time between experimental and control group.
3. The level of fibrinogen was decreased 157㎎/dl in experimental group less than control group.

협골궁부의 절제골편을 이용한 협골 성형술,"The zygoma is protruded on both sides of the midface and plays an important part in determining ideal oval shape of face. Orientals, who belong to the mesocephaly, have a more wide and depressed midface, and more prominent malar curve than the dolicocephalic caucasian. therefore, reduction of the zygomatic arch protrusion is necessary to decrease the facial horizontal diameter and, augmentation of the anterior zygomatic body is necessary to increase the facial anterior-posterior diameter.
Authors classify the zygomatic arch protrusion in the following 3 types:
1. Type Ⅰ : Only zygomatic arch protrusion.
2. Type Ⅱ : Zygomatic body and arch protrusion.
3. Type Ⅲ : Zygomatic arch protrusion with depressed anterior zygomatlc body.

신경초종에 의한 표재요골신경의 압박,"Purpose: Schwannoma, a benign peripheral nerve tumor, is slow-growing, encapsulated neoplasm that originates from the Schwann cell of the nerve sheath. Schwannoma most frequently involves the major nerve. Schwannoma occurring in the superficial radial nerve rare. This is a report of our experience with schwannoma arising from the superficial radial nerve with neurologic symptom.
Methods: A 55-year-old woman presented with eightmonth history of progressive numbness and paresthesia in dorsum of the thumb and index finger. Physical examination revealed a localized mass on the midforearm.
Sonographic examination showed an ovoid, heterogenous, hypoechoic lesion, located eccentrically in related to the superficial radial nerve. The lesion was mobile in the transverse but not in the longitudinal axis of the nerve, which was thought to favour schwannoma rather than neurofibroma. At operation, a 20 × 15 mm ovoid, yellowish grey mass was seen arising from the superficial radial nerve. The tumor present as eccentric masses over which the nerve fibers are splayed. Using operating microscope, the tumor was removed, preserving the surrounding nerve.
Results: Histology confirmed that the mass was a benign schwannoma. There were no postoperative complications. After two months the patient had no clinically demonstrable sensory deficit.
Conclusion: An unsusual case of a schwannoma of the superficial radial nerve is presented. In case with neurologic symptom, prompt surgical decompression must be made to prevent further nerve damage and to restore nerve function early.",김현성,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013068
Bird Face Deformity의 교정,"Extreme mandibular retrognathia produces a characteristic facial appearance which is known familliarly as the 'bird face deformity' in Germany ('vogelgeschicht') the 'Andy Gump' face in the United states, and the 'gold fish mouth' in Korea. This deformity can result from various causes. It can occur congenitally, either alone or as part of hemifacial microsomia. More common are developmental causes, often secondary to childhood trauma. These cases are often associated with temperomandibular joint ankylosis. Retrognathia is often associated with other facial deformities, especially those of the maxilla. The management of mild degrees of retrognathia is well described in many articles and textbooks. Many plastic suegeons routinely treat mild degree of pseudoretrognathia with bone or alloplastic implants, and more severe deformities are treated with sliding genioplasties, or various sliding osteotomies. We have found, in the course of treating a number of such patients, that the treatment of such cases requires the application of several different treatment modalities to achieve optimal results.
In this paper we present six representative patients with severe retrognathia and discuss the various surgical procedures we used to treat their multiple problems.",김동일,1986,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555424
수술후 조기 운동이 부종 감소에 미치는 영향에 대한 실험적 연구,"Edema is an inevitable outcome in any kinds of operative procedure and such edema is an important factor in determining postoperative prognosis or complication. Presently, there are numerous efforts in trying to reduce these postoperative edema. Early postoperative exercise has been proposed to reduce edema, however is exact role or clinical significance has yet to be verified.
Here, the author induced edema in the extremity of rabbit by severing all the tissue except bone & neurovascular bundle and repairing them. Such rabbits were divided into exercise group and joint immobilization group and consequently they were compared for their increases in circumference and volume due to edema. Also tissue samples were obtained on postoperative day 7 and observed for their histological difference under microscope.
Results were as follows.
1) From postoperative day 1 to 3 there was no significant difference of edema in two groups, however joint immobilizaton group showed slightly lesser edema.
2) In exercise group edema continuously increased until a peak was reached on postoperative day 3 which from this point on edema decreased slowly, however in immobilization group the peak was reached on postoperative day 5 and from then on it failed to decrease and continued up to postoperative day 7.
3) From postoperative day 4 immobilization group showed significant edema as compared to exercise group and with the passing time this significance continued to increase.
4) In the histological examination on postoperative day 7, more inflammatory cells were infiltrated and more degenerative findings were observed in joint immobilization group than exercise group.
In conclusion, early postoperative exercise decreases edema beginning from postoperative day 4, but without exercise edema increases up to postoperative day 5 and continues to maintain edema until postoperative day 7.",김양우,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013540
Salvage of Infected Breast Implants,"Background Implant-based breast reconstruction is being performed more frequently, and implants are associated with an increased risk of infection. We reviewed the clinical features of cases of implant infection and investigated the risk factors for breast device salvage failure. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 771 patients who underwent implant-based breast reconstruction between January 2010 and December 2016. Age, body mass index, chemotherapy history, radiation exposure, and smoking history were assessed as potential risk factors for postoperative infection. We also evaluated the presence and onset of infection symptoms, wound culture pathogens, and other complications, including seroma, hematoma, and mastectomy skin necrosis. Additionally, we examined the mastectomy type, the use of acellular dermal matrix, the presence of an underlying disease such as hypertension or diabetes, and axillary node dissection. Results The total infection rate was 4.99% (58 of 1,163 cases) and the total salvage rate was 58.6% (34 of 58). The postoperative duration to closed suction drain removal was significantly different between the cellulitis and implant removal groups. Staphylococcus aureus infection was most frequently found, with methicillin resistance in 37.5% of the cases of explantation. Explantation after infection was performed more often in patients who had undergone 2-stage expander/implant reconstruction than in those who had undergone direct-to-implant reconstruction. Conclusions Preventing infection is essential in implant-based breast reconstruction. The high salvage rate argues against early implant removal. However, when infection is due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus and the patient's clinical symptoms do not improve, surgeons should consider implant removal.","Song, Joon Ho",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013153
하악각축소술시 절제된 골의 간치이식을 이용한 턱끝증대술,"The square face or the box face appearance is quite common in orientals as well as occidentals and consists of flaring at the mandible angle areas with exaggerated posterior inferior projection of the mandibular angle in combination with a small and weak chin, resulting in widened bigonial distance and shortened lower third of face. Such patients complain of unbalanced and masculine appearance and may regard themselves as unaesthetic. To correct these deformities simultaneously, the mandible angles were resected (angled osteotamy) and the bone fragment from these ostectomized mandibular angles were used to augment the chin as an autogenous interpositional bone graft.
At the Institute of Plastic and Reconstruction Craniofacial Surgery(IPRCS), Ice University Collage of Medicine, twenty eight cases were successfully operated in this manner during a six-year period from June 1989 to May 1995. Patient's satisfaction was high and improved esthetics were noted in all patients with minimal complications.
The advantages are:
l. Simultaneous correction of prominent mandible angle and augmentation of the deficient chin area.
2. Provides vertical elongation of the chin and lower face, which gives visual compensation for agittal weakness of the lower face.
3. Improves upper and lower facial balance.
4. Another donor site for bone is not necessary, thus avoiding unnecessary donor site morbidity.
5. Homogenous autologous bone is used thus reducing the chance of resorption.

절골술을 이용한 미용 목적의 턱 성형술,"The most important factor in facial aesthetics is the harmony on the facial skeleton and soft tissue. Although the mandible constitute lower one third of the facial skeleton, minimal alterations can produce a wide range of facial deformities because of its prominent location and the intimate interrelationships of the facial bone. There are several deformities such as prominent mandibular angles, prognathism, microgenia, and asymmetry that are regarded as poor facial aesthetics.
We carried out a retrospective review of the 56 mandibular contouring surgery, which were performed in the period from January 1988 to January 1995 in Guro hospital. The age range was 18 to 42 years and female was approximately 2 times more frequent than male. The types of the mandibular deformities included 24 prominent mandibular angles, 9 prognathisms, 8 microgenias, 5 asymmetries, and 10 deformities with combinations of aforementioned problems and midfacial deformities.
To plan the mandibular contouring, photographs with planimetry, cephalogram, and panoramic view of the mandible were obtained. 24 prominent mandibular angles were contoured through intraoral approach. Angle ostectomy was performed in conjunction with malar reduction, for correction of prominent malar eminences, in 3 cases. Angle ostectomy was performed in conjunction with sliding advancement genioplasty, for correction of microgenia, in 4 cases. 9 prognathisms were corrected with vertical ramus osteotomy. 8 microgenias were corrected with sliding advancement genioplasty. Among these, 3 cases were performed in conjunction with bone graft due to their severity. 5 asymmetries were corrected by genioplasty and bone graft.
The results were evaluated based on the consideration of the deformity by means of radiology, photography, and interview with the patients. In prominent mandibular angles, most patients were pleased with the results. In prognathisms, the mean horizontal changes of hard and soft pogonion were 9.3 mm and 8.5 mm, respectively. The soft tissue response to bone adjustment was approximately 1 : 0.91. In microgenias, the mean horizontal changes of hard and soft pogonion were 8.8 mm and 6.5 mm, respectively. The soft tissue response to bone adjustment was approximately 1 : 0.75. One case showed infection in mandibular angle ostectomy group which was solved with intraoral incision and drainage, and antibiotics. In microgenias, 1 partial mental nerve damage nerve damage was encountered but it was recovered spontaneously after 3 months. In a case of combination angle ostectomy with sliding genioplasty, prolonged lower lip edema remained for 1 month. We concluded that osteotomy for mandibular contouring procedure was a safe, reliable, and simple procedure due to development of operative techniques and tools.",김우경,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014230
고압산소요법이 피부이식에 미치는 영향에 관한 임상적 연구,"Skin grafting is one of the most commonly used procedures in the plastic surgical field. However, skin flaps are preferred to skin grafts because hyperpigmentation, contraction, and creases develop more frequently in skin grafts. Nevertheless, skin grafting should be performed when the defects are multiple and extensive as in burns, or are adjacent to major anatomical structures. In these cases, full thickness skin grafts attached to subcutaneous fat may be used to overcome above disadvantages of skin grafts and to replace skin flaps.
In this study, postoperative hyperbaric oxygen therapies were used to improve survivals of these composite grafts during the plasmatic imbibition period. Experimental cases were randomly selected by the blind method. Full thickness skin grafts containing adequate amount of subcutaneous fat or cartilage were used to improve the quality of the grafted skin Postoperatively, the patient was placed in the hyperbaric chamber of 2.5ATA 100% oxygen for 60minutes, twice a day and 10 times overall. Rate was estimated on 7th postoperative day by gross findings.
Authors concluded that this combined hyperbaric oxygen therapy could extend the donor site including the abdomen and increases the survival rate of skin grafts.",민경원,1992,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014272
Unusual Bilateral Impalement Injury with Rusted Iron Bars on Face and Neck,"Impalement injury is the subset of penetrating trauma, defined as fixed, elongated objects penetrate and remain in the human body cavity or region by relatively low velocity.
We report an unusual case of facial and neck impalement where two dirty rusted iron bars penetrated forehead bilaterally and exited neck and ear respectively without causing major organ injuries. After thorough radiologic and physical evaluation, the patient got medical and surgical treatment. The patient was discharged without complication after four day of delayed wound closure. There have been no complications and sequelaes related with trauma, wound infection and scar contracture at 3-year follow-up.
According to affected organs and pattern of impalement, individualized and multidisciplinary surgical approach should be considered. Following these guidelines as in this case, it was possible to achieve excellent clinical outcome in impalement injury.",서현석,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2012712
The utility of three-dimensional models in complex microsurgical reconstruction,"Background Three-dimensional (3D) model printing improves visualization of anatomical structures in space compared to two-dimensional (2D) data and creates an exact model of the surgical site that can be used for reference during surgery. There is limited evidence on the effects of using 3D models in microsurgical reconstruction on improving clinical outcomes.
Methods A retrospective review of patients undergoing reconstructive breast microsurgery procedures from 2017 to 2019 who received computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans only or with 3D models for preoperative surgical planning were performed. Preoperative decision- making to undergo a deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) versus muscle-sparing transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (MS-TRAM) flap, as well as whether the decision changed during flap harvest and postoperative complications were tracked based on the preoperative imaging used. In addition, we describe three example cases showing direct application of 3D mold as an accurate model to guide intraoperative dissection in complex microsurgical reconstruction.
Results Fifty-eight abdominal-based breast free-flaps performed using conventional CTA were compared with a matched cohort of 58 breast free-flaps performed with 3D model print.
There was no flap loss in either group. There was a significant reduction in flap harvest time with use of 3D model (CTA vs. 3D, 117.7±14.2 minutes vs. 109.8±11.6 minutes; P=0.001). In addition, there was no change in preoperative decision on type of flap harvested in all cases in 3D print group (0%), compared with 24.1% change in conventional CTA group.
Conclusions Use of 3D print model improves accuracy of preoperative planning and reduces flap harvest time with similar postoperative complications in complex microsurgical reconstruction.",Adeyemi A. Ogunleye,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104770023
실리콘판과 실리콘접착제로 만든 비삽입물,"Augmentation rhinoplasty now involves flat noses as well as saddle or deviated noses. Creation of an accurate nasal implant is critical for augmentation rhinoplasty in such cases. The author has devised a new method to create implants. First, an ideal nasal patters is made from a xeroradiogram of a profile of the face. A silicone sheet (0.06 inch in thickness) is then tailored to this pattern and mounted on a stone model of the patient's nasal impression. Silicone adhesive is squeezed onto both sides of the silicone sheet and cured. Finally a carving of the outer surface of the implant is done with a #11 blade. Consequently a nasal implant is composed of silicone sheet and silicone adhesive.
The results of the clinical experience of augmentation rhinoplasty with this implant are as follows:
1. A shaping of the implant with the same angle and size of the preoperative design.
2. The undersurface of the implant has contact with the patient's nasal contour.
3. A smooth and natural curvature of the nose.
4. Easy carving because the implant is attached firmly to the stone model.
5. Preoperative discussion with the patient is possible.
6. A saving of operative time because the implant is perfectly shaped preoperatively
7. Less expense than other types of silicone implants.
8. The making of the implants is easier for inexperienced workers.
9. The disadvantages are that it is more time consuming and is a staged production",한기환,1988,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107049569
한국 영화와 드라마에 나타난 성형외과 의사와 성형수술의 이미지,"Nowadays, plastic surgical operations are increasingly being performed in Korea. We have gained added interest in this because some professional pictures contain plastic surgery in their venue. In the films, we intend to see the recognition of society for plastic surgeons and which field of plastic surgery. The list of movies for analysis were 'Plastic Beauty (1975)', 'Penthouse Elephant (2005)', '200 Pounds Beauty (2006)', 'Cinderella (2006)', and 'Time (2006)'. The TV dramas were 'She is looking (2005)', 'Lovers (2006-2007)', and 'Before & After Plastic Surgery Clinic (2008)'. Films were analyzed according to the following: the chief complaints and names of the operations, character of plastic surgeons, result of the operation and its possibility in reality, and its effect of plastic surgery on the life of the patients. Most of the film contained facial transplantation or the change of the face or body different from the original shape. Character type of the plastic surgeons was mostly medical realism, rather than ideal humanism. Most of the plastic surgeons have capability as a doctor; however, some of them had extramarital affairs. The surgery was successful in most of the cases, but were the patients happy with the results? This was not the case in the movies. In only one movie, '200 Pounds Beauty', the patient became happy; rest of them were eminently unhappy with the outcome. Why the discrepancy? It is difficult to analyze the minds of the people in the films, but considering that the majority of the characters in the films were rather unsavory, one may deduce that a crooked mind functions differently. Perhaps it is too much to hope for a day that will come when we will see a film that portrays the mental anguish that accompanies each and every procedure the Korean plastic surgeons make.",김한준,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013624
댄디워커증후군에 동반된 점막 밑 입천장갈림증 치험례,"Purpose: Dandy-Walker syndrome is a rare congenital brain malformation that occurs one in every 25,000-35,000 live births, mostly in females. It is characterized by cystic enlargement of the fourth ventricle, agenesis or hypogenesis of the cerebellar vermis and enlargement of the posterior fossa. In this report, the authors aimed to address a rare case of a 14-months-old female Dandy-Walker syndrome patient that is presented with submucous cleft palate. Methods: A 14-months-old female patient admitted to our outpatient clinic, via the department of pediatrics, with the complaints of nasal regurgitation, choking and breathing difficulties. She was diagnosed as Dandy-Walker syndrome by magnetic resonance imaging evaluation, at another hospital and underwent a shunt operation for the hydrocephalus continuing treatments. On physical examination, she had structural abnormality of bifid uvula, and palpable notch in the posterior surface of the hard palate. Her submucous cleft palate was corrected, which used a double opposing Z-plasty under general anesthesia. Results: In a follow-up period of 2 months, no complications, such as wound dehiscence, necrosis and infection occurred, which shows satisfactory results. She consulted with pediatric neurologists and physical therapists for further evaluation and management of the abnormalities in the central nervous system. Conclusion: Dandy-Walker syndrome patient with a cleft palate is a very rare case to find, which only a few cases are reported around the world. Authors would like to share this case of Dandy-Walker syndrome patient, with submucous cleft palate, who underwent a double opposing Z-plasty that shows satisfactory results.",강범식,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102070515
모호한 외부 성기를 가진 소아에서 1단계 외부 생식기 재건술,"The criteria for the identification of sex are as follows; sex chromosome and chromatin, gonadal structure, morphology of the external genitalia, morphology of the internal genitalia, hormonal status, sex of rearing and gender role. During these steps, any disturbance may be presented clinically as a disorder of intersexuality. Hermaphroditism is a state of having ambiguous genitalia due to abnormal sexual differentiation.
We experienced three children with ambiguous external genitalia. Two patients were male pseudohemaphrodites, who had a normal male chromosomal constitution of 46XY with incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia and hypospadia. One patient was female pseudohemaphrodite, who had a normal female chromosomal constitution of 46XX with male phallus-like enlarged clitoris associated with posterior labial fusion and single perineal urogenital orifice. There was elevated urinary 17 ketosteriod and hypertrophied adrenal gland on CT scan. We planned staged reconstruction because they were children. First stage reconstruction were surgical restoration of the ambiguous external genitalia to normal appearance and removal of contradictory gonadal structure as early as possible. Second stage reconstruction includes reconstruction of secondary sex characteristics after puberty such as mammaplasty, vaginoplasty, and facial plasty. Hormonal therapy was necessary for normalization of hormonal status and promotion of expression of secondary sex characteristics.
In first stage reconstruction, we performed clitoroplasty by use of glans penis island flap with dorsal neurovascular bundle, labioplasty and orchiectomy in two male hermaphroites. All neoclitoris survived well with good preservation of sensation.",이백권,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102070512

However, It is often impossible to correct surgically because the general conditions of these patients are poor. It is known that the hydrogel has a powerful autolytic effect by providing moist environments and facilitates wound healing and hydrocolloid dressing is also known to promotes granulation tissue formation and epithelialization. The patients were treated with hydrogel(Purion gel, Coloplast A/S, Denmark) and hydrocolloid dressing (Comfeel Plus Transparent Dressing, Coloplast A/S, Denmark) after surgical debridement of pressure sores progressed to stage III(n=2) and IV(n=7). This combination treatment could facilitate to debride the nectrotic tissue and promote granulation tissue formation epithelialization simultaneously. We could achieve complete healing of pressure sores using the combination treatment without requiring surgical correction.In conclusion, hydrogel in combination with hydrocolloid dressing is effective in acheiving complete healing of progressed pressure sores.",김융수,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014316
선천성 구순열 및 구개열 환자의 임상적 고찰,"Until recent years, the birth of a child with a cleft of the lip or palate was surrounded by supersitition and mystery. All congenital malformations were commonly ascribed to a multitude of natural and supernatural prenatal influecnes. Many scientists hampered by their inability to make direct observations of human fetal development within the uterus, ascribed malformation to defective inheritance and adopted a fetalistic attitude toward them.
The authors reviewed and discussed our clinical experience of 798 cases of cleft lip and palate patient who were treated at Red Cross Hospital from Apr. 1978 to December 1982.
Clinical analysis of these 798 cases of cleft lip and palate patients were carried out and summarized as follows.

창상치유에 관한 복합마데카솔의 효과,"This study was designed to assess the effects of compound madecassol(madecassic acid with neomycin sulfate and hydrocortisone acetate) on the wound healing. Madecassol is a titrated extract of centella asiatica and the clinical effects of madecassol are stated to the enhancement of wound healing and the prevention and relief of excessive scar formation. Compound madecassol is composed of madecassol and neomycin sulfate and hydrocortisone acetate. Neomycin sulfate has antibiotic effect and hydrocortisone acetate has antiinflammatory and antiallergic effects. So, compound madecassol has a synergistic effect of madecassol as well as neomycin sulfate and hydrocortisone acetate.
Using 54 rats, we compared the effect of compound madecassol on wound healing at 3rd, 7th, 14th, and 21th postoperative days. This study examined the histologic findings and the gross findings which were wound size, epithelization and quality of granulation tissue. In this study, compound madecassol showed lower degree of inflammatory infiltration, shorter inflammatory phases and less wound contraction. The number of the myofibroblast in the group of compound madecassol were fewer than other groups. Granulation tissue of the compound madecassol was relatively healthier than others. There were no significant difference of re-epithelization between compound madecassol and other groups.
In conclusion, compound madecassol can reduce excessive wound contraction and promotes wound healing process.",유영천,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555640
두개 악안면 수술시 새로운 골대체물로 이용될 수 있는 계란껍질에 대한 연구,"The first successful bone transplantation carried out in 1688 by Van Meek'ren, a Dutch surgeon.
The ideal bone substitute should be biocompatible, osteoinductive or at least osteoconductive, available in unlimited quantity, low cost and have satisfactory mechanical properties.
To accomplish these goals, autografts are still preferred material. However, bone harvesting procedures have been focused to solve the following problems; necessity of a second surgical site, morbidity and potential deformity of the donor site, an increased operative time, donor availability limitations, and resorption of autogenic bone grafts.
Ten adult white New Zealand rabbits, three, 10 mm in diameter, full layer skull defects were made in the frontoparietal bone. Two bone defects were filled with hydroxyapatite and powdered eggshell, the other defect was not filled(control).
All animals were sacrified at 10 weeks, the specimens were examined macroscopically to test for graft mobility. The graft with surrounding bone was then harvested and studied by histology.
The results were as follows:
1. Control: Bone regeneration occurred nearly complete.
2. Hydroxyapatite:
Macroscopically - No encapsulation. Despite a gross delineation between implant and bone, imlant was firmly united to bone.
Histology - Bony trabeculae surrounded by proliferated connective tissue are observed in the defect site and implant. Osteoblastic rimming is noted along the bone fragments
3. Powdered eggshell:
Macroscopically - Grafted site was encapsulated by proliferated connective tissue and palpable softer than the surrounding bone.
Histology - The presence of eggshell particles encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue. Partial bone regeneration from the defect margin was noticed, but the bone healing was never complete.
In conclusion, the use of safe and inexpensive material is recommended for filling limited bone defects in non-weight bearing areas. The use of powdered eggshell for bone substitute may also be considered, after further studies, to access its long term stability, porosity and biocompatibility.",윤창신,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014421
Analysis of Facial Asymmetry in Deformational Plagiocephaly Using Three-Dimensional Computed Tomographic Review,"Background: Infants with deformational plagiocephaly (DP) usually present with cranialvault deformities as well as facial asymmetry. The purpose of this study was to use threedimensionalanthropometric data to evaluate the influence of cranial deformities onfacial asymmetry.
Methods: We analyzed three-dimensional computed tomography data for infants withDP (n=48) and without DP (n=30, control). Using 16 landmarks and 3 reference planes,22 distance parameters and 2 angular parameters were compared. This cephalometricassessment focused on asymmetry of the orbits, nose, ears, maxilla, and mandible.
We then assessed the correlation between 23 of the measurements and cranial vaultasymmetry (CVA) for statistical significance using relative differences and correlationanalysis.
Results: With the exception of few orbital asymmetry variables, most measurementsindicated that the facial asymmetry was greater in infants with DP. Mandibular and nasalasymmetry was correlated highly with severity of CVA. Shortening of the ipsilateralmandibular body was particularly significant. There was no significant deformity in themaxilla or ear.
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the cranial vault deformity in DP is associatedwith facial asymmetry. Compared with the control group, the infants with DP werefound to have prominent asymmetry of the nose and mandible.",문일영,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014407
욕창의 외과적 치료,"The prevalence of pressure sores is increasing, mainly due to the increased number of patient with spinal cord injuries or with the long-term debilitated patients after traffic, industrial, or other accidents.
The interest of plastic surgeons in pressure sores has increased and the techniques in the surgical management of pressure sores were also much improved.
Especially, CO poisoning plays a very large role in causing pressure sores in Korea, in contrast with Western countries.
This thesis reports the following results drawn from clinical research on 18 cases of pressure sores who were treated in the Department of Plastic surgery in Kyungpook National University Hospital during the period between Jan. 1981 and Jun. 1985.
1) On sex distribution, males were predominant (2:1).
2) On age distribution, all cases were included in the productive age group, but most common age group affected was the 20∼29 group.
3) On etiologic distribution, trauma and CO intoxication were most common, and males were more commonly affected by trauma.
4) Eight of eighteen cases were ambulatory.
5) Locations of pressure were mainly sacral and trochanteric area.
6) In depth of sorses, in neary all the patients with ores after trauml, the sores reached to the underlying. These sores were treated by myocutaneous flaps.
7) On initial examination, 4 of 11 cases revealed serum protein below 6gm%, and 7 of 16 cases revealed hemoglobin below 12gm%.
8) Bacteriologically, staphylococcus, pseudomonas and proteus were the main infection organisms. These organisms had multiple drug resistance to antibiotics.
9) Postoperative complications were noted in about one third of the cases. Among the complications were flap tip necrosis, loss of skin graft and wound disruption. These noted in male patients.
10) The average postoperative hospitalization was 12 days after S.T.S.G., 25 days after local flaps, and 54 days after myocutaneous flaps. In the last group, there were many other reasons for their long term hospitalization, though their wounds were healed and needed no further procedures.",김인규,1985,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104757228

We analyzed theses patients retrospectively by chart review and patients follow-up to evaluate the clinical manifestations and treatment modality of necrotizing fasciitis. The causes of necrotizing fasciitis were trauma(1), insect bite(1), vibrio vulnificus(1), unknown(3). All patients except one child were treated with early aggressive excision of the lesion and later, remaining wounds were covered with skin graft and/or local flaps. Broad spectrum antibiotics were selected in combination with surgical intervention. All grafts and flaps healed without any problem. One child was so treated not by excision but by wide incision and drainage that there is no need for additional operation for wound coverage. In our cases, necrotizing fasciitis usually occurred at the lower extremity and associated with chronic medical disease. The etiology of the disease was frequently unknown. All patients were cured without death. It might be due to early aggressive surgical intervention in combination of intensive medical care, such as fluid and nutritional therapy and introduction of appropriate antibiotics.

Herein we can postulate the positive effect of augmentation rhinoplasty to mandibular setback and advancement genioplasty.
Augmentation rhinoplasty per se has an effect of advancing soft tissue nasion and nasal tip in the facial profile. These changes have an indirect camouflaging effect on mandibular prognathism. Theoretically because the advanced nasion has an effect of diminution of SNB angle and nasal tip projection and advanced chin have an effect of moving Ricketts' esthetic line anteriorly.

Fluid cultures taken at the time of wound exploration were initially negative, but NTM was isolated by culture 10 days later. Results: The implant was removed. M. fortuitum was identified by acid-fast culture and NTM-PCR. The patient was treated with combined antibiotic therapy.
Conclusion: Although it is difficult to diagnose NTM infection after breast surgery, it is important that surgeons include NTM infection in the differential diagnosis of a post mammoplasty infection after breast implant surgery.",이혁재,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013212
저산소 및 재산소화가 배양된 태아 섬유아세포에 미치는 영향,"The wound healing process in fetus is quite different from that of adult. Regeneration plays an important role and scarless wound healing is possible in early gestational fetal period. Recently, the various effects of the hypoxia and reoxygenation in the wound healing process have been investigated by many reseachers. The hypoxic state is known to alter protein synthesis and gene expression of TGF-β, VEGF. The authors hypothesize there may be differences between fetal and adult fibroblast and this difference may play a possible role in the mechanism of scarless fetal wound healing. In this study, we investigated the growth of fibroblast, the amount of collagen deposition, the amount of protein synthesis and gene expression in TGF-β(transforming growth factor-β), VEGF(vascular endothelial growth factor) under the various hypoxic and reoxygenation conditions. Through these processes, we tried to determine the relationships between scarless fetal wound healing and hypoxic condition. In control group, fetal and adult fibroblasts were cultured under normoxic condition. The experimental groups were allocated into four different groups. The differences in TGF-β, VEGF under 24, 48, 72 hours were statistically investigated. Compared to adult fibroblast group, there was a statistically significant increase (p<0.01) in the rates of protein synthesis in TGF-β and VEGF of fetal fibroblast.In this study, these results may reflect the possibility that fetal fibroblast are more susceptible to change in oxygen and has a superior rate of angiogenesis through increased VEGF expression. The possible superiority of angiogenesis in fetal fibroblast may play an important role in scarless wound healing.",박병윤,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555339
전내측 하지 근막피판을 이용한 하퇴부 재건,"The skin and soft tissue defects of the lower leg may occur after trauma and in association with osteomyelitis.
There are several methods to reconstruction of the skin and soft tissue defects of the lower leg, which ar local flaps, myocutaneous flaps, fasciocutaneous flaps, and free flaps.
""The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are well known. Among these, fasciocutaneous flaps have more or less limitations because of a relatively rich vascular plexus, and their advantages are simple surgical techniques, less cost, and less hospitalization. The most important operative techniques includes the deep fascia in the flaps with avoiding of damaging the fascial plexus. The fascial plexus is located immediately superficial to the deep fascia and communicates with subdermal plexus.
We successfully transfered fasciocutaneous island flaps based on the medial septocutaneous vessels of the leg in seven patients. The results are satisfactory and these antermedial fasciocutaneous leg island flaps are thin, reliable and safe.
They are relatively easy to elevate and are useful covering of defects of distal two-third of the lower leg. The following case reports demonstrate technical considerations in each case and the advantages of anteromedial fasciocutaneous leg island flap on the reconstruction of the skin and soft tissue defects in the lower leg.",오원석,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555338
미세모발이식법을 이용한 남성형 탈모증의 치료 : 64례의 경험,"Male pattern baldness is the most common form of the hair loss in both sexes. Various methods have been applied for treatment of male pattern baldness such as scalp reduction, scalp flaps and composite hair trans plantation, etc. Generally, the most important and difficult point of hair reconstruction would be the achievement of natural frontal hair lines. In order to solve the problems of unnatural frontal hair line that cannot fulfill aesthetic desires of patients, we have treated 64 cases of male pattern baldness with using hair transplantation techniques of minigraft an micrograft. In all cases the patients were treated by mixed method of minigraft and micrograft. The graft was done with 2 or 3 sessions and the each sessions had 6 month interval. With these micrograft and minigraft techniques, it was possible to produce a natural-looking, soft frontal hair line, hiding an unnatural-looking, dense hair line that starts abruptly with coarse hairs. It was also possible to hide disturbing visible scarring or cobble stoning of the foremost punch grafts.
We treated 64 cases of male pattern baldness by using hair transplantation technique and we had excellent result for the treatment of male pattern baldness by using the minigrafting and micrografting techniques.",이우용,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014070
Axillary Reconstruction for Hidradenitis Suppurativa with an Inner-Arm Transposition Flap Creating a Brachioplasty Effect,"Background Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin condition that can affect any area with apocrine sweat glands and has the potential to involve multiple sites concurrently. Commonly affected sites include the axilla, groin, perineum and perianal areas. In this study we performed a literature review on the surgical methods for HS and describe an innovative technique for reconstructing axilla HS using an inner-arm transposition flap. Methods We reviewed all cases (5 cases from 4 patients) of transposition flap reconstruction performed by the senior author at a single London tertiary hospital from 2008-2013. Patient related outcome measures were collected using the Derriford appearance scale (DAS 24) and a study specific questionnaire. Results All patients were satisfied with their final result. One out of five cases had a complication but did not result in flap failure. There is no disease recurrence to date. DAS 24 scores collected demonstrated acceptable postoperative distress that did not deviate far from the norm tables while study specific questionnaire reveal desirable outcomes. Conclusions We have managed to achieve our aim through the use of the innovative inner-arm transposition flap. Our study hopes to provide an additional technique for axillary reconstruction. This technique offers the effective concealment of scars with the benefit of tightening of the arm tissue producing 'brachioplasty like' effects. All things considered it would be reasonable to conclude the innovative flap technique is a reliable, effective, and simple method that results in multiple benefits.","Ching, Daniel L.",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014092
I형 콜라겐지지체의 다양한 가교처리 방법이 연골막성 연골재생에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: Collagen is the principal structural biomolecule in cartilage extracellular matrix, which makes it a logical target for cartilage engineering. In this study, porous type I collagen scaffolds were cross-linked using dehydrothermal(DHT) treatment and/or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide(EDC), in the presence and absence of chondroitin-6-sulfate(CS) for cartilage regeneration.Methods: Cartilage defects were created in the proximal part of the ear of New Zealand rabbits. Four types of scaffolds(n=4) were inserted. The types included DHT cross-linked(Group 1), DHT and EDC cross- linked(Group 2), CS added DHT cross-linked(Group 3), and CS added DHT and EDC cross-linked(Group 4). Histomorphometric analysis and cartilage-specific gene expression of the reconstructed tissues were evaluated respectively 4, 8, and 12 weeks after implantation.Results: The largest quantity of regenerated cartilage was found in DHT cross-linked groups 1 and 3 in the 8th week and then decreased in the 12th week, while calcification increased. Calcification was observed from the 8th week and the area increased in the 12th week. Group 4 was treated with EDC cross-linking and CS, and the matrix did not degrade in the 12th week. Cartilage-specific type II collagen mRNA expression increased with time in all groups.Conclusion: CS did not increase chondrogenesis in all groups. EDC cross-linking may prevent chondrocyte infiltration from the perichondrium into the collagen scaffold.",손대구,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103496587
가계도 분석을 통한 액취증 유전 경향에 대한 연구,"Purpose: Bacterial degeneration of sweat and increased secretion of over developed apocrine sweat gland are known causes of osmidrosis. In addition, genetic inheritance must be another important cause, because there are high incidence rates of osmidrosis in familial members. But the research about genetic inheritance has been overlooked. For this reason we studied genetic inheritance in osmidrosis patients based on pedigree analysis.
Methods: We have evaluated pedigree of 52 patients who have diagnosed and treated in our hospital from January 2003 to August 2007. For making pedigrees, we have evaluated 3 generations of affected lineage from osmidrosis patients. Family members having uncertain information or those who are before puberty are excluded. In pedigree analysis, inheritance rate and inheritance pattern from parents, prevalence rate in generations and sexual prevalence are evaluated.
Results: In this study, we divided pedigrees into 3 different groups according to inheritance pattern. Group A is genetically unrelated pattern with no prevalence between familial members in 7 families. Group B is weakly expressed pattern with 17 families there are genetically related but no genetic patterns are founded. In group B inheritance rate is 34% and incidence rate is 21% in 2nd generation and 22% in 3rd generation. Group C is autosomal dominant pattern with 31 families. In group C, there are no differences in sexual prevalence. Incidence rate is 43% in 2nd generation and 49% in 3rd generation.
Conclusion: In this study, we have studied pedigrees of 52 families of osmidrosis patients. 60% of the pedigrees shows autosomal dominant pattern, 33% shows genetically related but no definite autosomal dominant pattern and 7% shows genetically unrelated pattern. In Conclusion, This study can be basic data for future gene analysis study of osmidrosis.",이정우,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555268
Estrogen 장기치료 후 성전환증 환자 음경의 해부.조직학적 변화,"To investigate the anatomic and histologic changes of penis as a result of long-term estrogen exposure on male, 14 penes were harvested from 14 male-to-female transsexuals who had male to female sex reassignment operation in Dong-A University Hospitall. The penils length was measured before operation and penile histologic study was done.
The results were as follows :
1. Age at inception of estrogen therapy was 16-24 years. The duration of estrogen therapy was 2-12 years (mean; 6.7 years).
2. The dose and method of estrogen treatment regimen were variable, but almost all patients were administrated 20 mg estradiol(Depovirin) per month for first 1 year.
3. The mean stretched penile length(SPL) was 7.9 cm.
4. The mean erectile cavernosal length(ECL) was 8.6 cm which was about 4 cm shorter than normal erectile penile length. The reduction of ECL had a tendency to be greater in proportion to the duration of estrogen exposure.
5. It was considered that the marked reduction of ECL was caused by increse of loose fibrous tissue and fatty infiltration between tunica albuginea and corpus cavernosum, which were present in most of the cases.
In conclusion, it was considered that the reduction of testosterone level due to negative feedback of estrogen on hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and direct effect of estrogen on penis such as fibrosis of corpus cavernosum might produce the adverse effect on penile erection which results int reduction of ECL after long-term estrogen exposure.",김주헌,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555329
METHYLMETHACRYLATE를 이용한 측두와 융기술,"Temporal area is important factor in the upper facial outline. The orientals are mesocephalic and their faces tend to look broad when viewed from the front. The main reason for this appearance is the prominent zygoma. When the temporal area is excessively concave, zygoma stands out and causes the face to appear seedy or older than actual age.
The depression of temporal area may be caused by aging process, weight, loss, removal of tumor, transposition of temporalis muscle or trauma.
We augmented the sunken temporal area by submuscular placement of methylmethacrylate in 6 cases. The submuscular insertion of methylmethacrylate in the temporal fossa has some advantage.
1. Natural movement of temporalis muscle during mastication can be preserved.
2. No fixation needs for the prevention of the displacement of the implant.
3. More volume of implant can be inserted into the temporal fossa without palpability.",류재만,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014389
욕창 감염의 세균 역학과 항생제 감수성,"Purpose: Pressure sore wound develops inevitably in long-term, immobilized and hospitalized patients. Sore wound infection is common problem and makes healing process difficult. We aimed to identify the pathogens of the purulent discharge in sore wound and to obtain information for appropriate antibiotics through a sensitivity testMethods: The bacteriologic study was made on 120 cases of patients who admitted or visited our hospital from 2004 January to 2005 December for sore wound treatment. Culture material was collected in BBL transport media with cotton swab and cultured by MacConkey agar plate. The method of MIC by VITEK and Microscan was used for sensitivity test. Results: Among 120 specimens, organisms were isolated from 77(64.2%) cases. Gram positive organisms were cultured in 73 specimens, Gram negative organisms in 46 specemens, and fungi in 2 specimens. Mixed infection by Gram (+) and Gram (-) bacteria were observed in 34 specimens. Among them, S. aureus was the most common isolate in 24(31.2%) patients and 10 (13.0%) S. Aureus isolates were MRSA.

僧帽筋皮辯(TRAPEZIUS MYCOUTANEOUS FLAP)의 임상적 응용,"The concept of the myocutaneous flap has established various anatomic territories from which flaps may be elevated for reconstruction of defects in the area of head and neck.
The trapezius muscle is a flat, triangular muscle, covering the back of the neck and shoulder. It arises from the medial one-third of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone, the external occipital protuberance, the ligamentum nuchae, the spine of the seventh cervical and the spines of all the thracic vertebrae and the corresponding portion of the supraspinous ligament. The upper part of the muscle inserts to the lateral third of the clavicle; the middle part into the medial edge of the acromion and the upper border of the spine of the scapular; the lower part to terminate in a tubercle at the medial end of the spine of the scapular.
The trapezius is supplied by the accessory nerve and also by branches from the third and fourth cervical nerves, which are probably sensory. The vascular supply comes from the transverse cercical artery and the occipital artery primarily.

일측성 구순열 교정에서 인중융선의 형성,"The philtral unit plays a key role in the appearance of the upper lip. And making the philtral column is extremely important in unilateral cleft lip repair for natural looking lip. Previously, Millard incision scar simulated philtral column, but making the true elevated philtral column was not easy. And many methods using muscle flap, scar flap and conchal cartilage graft were not satisfactory for making philtral column in the secondary cleft lip. So Author hypothesized 3 considerable points in making philtral column.
1) Skin excess over the repaired muscle of the lip.
2) Relief of tension
3) Insertion of tissue between skin and muscle along the line of philtral column.
Point 1) & 2) is absolutely necessary and point 3) is relatively and occasionally necessary for making the philtral column. To Make philtral column by inserting something in the situation of lack of point 1) & 2), make the lip only thick.
To relieve tension, author used Latham intraoral orthopedic appliance to narrow alveolar gap. The deviated septum was dislocated and fixed to the midline point and cinching was done. Supraperiosteal muscle dissection near the pyriform aperture to relieve the tension from the lateral lip segment wass done.
We performed 156 cases of unilateral cleft lip repair from Mar. 1991 to Mar. 1993. In most cases we cannot see flat lip in the repaired cleft lip cases.
Skin excess over the repaired muscle is most important to make a philtral ridge. And to relieve tension is also necessary not to make philtral column but to make a least scar line. Primary repair is the optimal time and Millard technique is method of choice to make a philtral column.",엄기일,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014253
안검하수 환자의 쌍꺼풀수술,"In correction of ptosis, symmetry of lid contour, lash position and lid height must be matched. Most of blepharoptosis patients want to perform both the double eyelid operation and ptosis repair at the same time to achieve the best cosmetic and functional result.
Using a surgical technique directed at the levator aponeurosis or the frontalis muscle with double eyelid operation, we corrected 13 cases of unilateral and 10 cases of bilateral congenital blepharoptosis. In unilateral ptosis with good or fair levator function, levator resection was performed and the position of the lid margin was adjusted at 1~2 mm below the superior limbus. The height of the lid crease of the ptotic eye is determined 1~3 mm lower than that of normal side. The position of the lid margin is adjusted at the level of the superior limbus and the height of the lid crease of the ptotic eye is determined 2~4 mm lower than that of nonptotic side.

새로운 방법을 이용한 Tie-Over Dressing,"The most important basic requirements for successful skin grafting are the accurate approximation of the edge of the skin graft to that of the wound and the application of even pressure to the graft by a carefully designed dressing. Pressure dressing is indicated for the protection of the graft and the prevention of shearing between the graft and its bed. One of the most widely used methods of pressure dressing is tie-over dressing. The traditional technique is based on the application of long silk sutures along the margin of the graft that are tied over bolus of antibiotics oint-impregnated nonadherent fluffed gauze. With the traditional tie-over dressing, it is impossible to inspect the graft bed for possible hematoma and seroma during the application of dressing. So we adopted another modification of the previously described tie-over dressing methods.
From January 1997 to July 1997, we had performed 27 skin graft surgeries and 8 subdermal shavings in 35 patients with our new method of tie-over dressing. We can apply even pressure to the grafts by twisting the long silk sutures instead of typing.
In comparison with the plethora of devices and techniques described previously in tie-over dressing construction, our technique offers simplicity and reliable fixation of the graft to the bed and allows further adjustment of the dressing by individual tightening of the threads. Other particularly attractive features are the ability to inspect the graft at any time with little difficulty and the reapplicability of tie-over dressing with the remaining long threads if needed.",황경하,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014368

광대뼈 축소술에 있어서 재배치와 고정,"Purpose: It has always been an aspiration for Asians to look more balanced and feminine, considering their facial features regarding relatively flat midface with marked prominences of the zygoma. Many studies have been dealt in this subject. However, the authors would like to emphasize the concept and introduce the technique of repositioning of the malar complex to a cosmetically beneficial point and stationing it on proper position by fixation on zygoma body and arch.
Methods: From January 1998 to December 2007, this method was performed in 50 patients of mild to moderate prominence and malposition of the malar complex. A simplified technique of lateral orbital osteotomy and oblique osteotomy on zygomatic arch through intraoral and preauricular incision was developed. Then, liberal malar complex can be moved to a supero-posterior direction and repositioned to a more cosmetically beneficial point. To maintain the stationed position and to protect from vector affected by the attached masticating muscle to zygomatc bone, fixation was done on both zygoma body and arch.
Results: We have obtained satisfactory results using this procedure without any observable complications. The advantages of this procedure are proper exposure, inconspicuous scar, safe, more natural contour, improved stability, and shorter healing time.
Conclusion: The authors suggest that reduction malarplasty should be approached with underlying concept of repositioning and fixation. In mild moderate malar prominent cases, our technique will provide with maintenance of aesthetic concept, equal to the malar reduction performed under coronal approach and provide with more natural facial contour with stability even with less invasive surgical approach.",황소민,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013646

The author designed a new direct transcutaneous reductionmethod with threaded K-wire and applied this method to some cases.
The author conclude the advantages of this method are as followings.
1) There is no destruction of fine submuscular structure around lower eyelid and zygoma.
2) There are no incision on the face and scalp.
3) The relapse of the displacement was not occurred.
4) The surgical method is very simple.
5) It takes very short(10-15 minutes)",박병윤,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013015
일측성 구순열의 이차 변형에 대한 임상적 경험,"In the cases of unilateral cleft lip, the most prominent findings are asymmetric and deformed upper lip and nose. Numerous methods have been published by many authors to correct this troublesome problem. We followed and modified the previously published methods which seemed to be the most adequate procedure for the given problems.
During 5 years, from January, 1990 to December 1994, a total of 26 cases of secondary deformity of unilateral cleft lip were treated with our favorite methods which were
1. Functional muscle alingment repair to correct the deformity of the orbicularis oculi muscle
2. Reverse U-incision with vestibular z-plasty in addition to open rhinoplasty incision, and 3 point plication of alar cartilage to correct the nasal deformity
3. W-plasty on the nostril margin to correct the web of nostril
4. Small Z-plasty on the vermilion border to ever and protrude the white-roll with the phenomenon of dog-ear intended around the Z-plasty
5. Mucosal advancement of the labium and release of frenulum to augment the vermilion Our combination methods for secondary unilateral cleft lip and nasal deformity obtained excellent results in all patients.",안성열,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013007
Use of platelet-rich plasma and modified nanofat grafting in infected ulcers: Technical refinements to improve regenerative and antimicrobial potential,"Background Surgical reconstruction of chronic wounds is often infeasible due to infection, comorbidities, or poor viability of local tissues. The aim of this study was to describe the authors' technique for improving the regenerative and antimicrobial potential of a combination of modified nanofat and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in nonhealing infected wounds. Methods Fourteen patients met the inclusion criteria. Fat tissue was harvested from the lower abdomen following infiltration of a solution of 1,000 mL of NaCl solution, 225 mg of ropivacaine, and 1 mg of epinephrine. Aspiration was performed using a 3-mm cannula with 1-mm holes. The obtained solution was decanted and mechanically emulsified, but was not filtered. Non-activated leukocyte-rich PRP (naLR-PRP) was added to the solution before injection. Patients underwent three sessions of injection of 8-mL naLR-PRP performed at 2-week intervals. Results Thirteen of 14 patients completed the follow-up. Complete healing was achieved in seven patients (53.8%). Four patients (30.8%) showed improvement, with a mean ulcer width reduction of 57.5%±13.8%. Clinical improvements in perilesional skin quality were reported in all patients, with reduced erythema, increased thickness, and increased pliability. An overall wound depth reduction of 76.6%±40.8% was found. Pain was fully alleviated in all patients who underwent re-epithelization. A mean pain reduction of 42%±33.3% (as indicated by visual analog scale score) was found in non-re-epithelized patients at a 3-month follow-up. Conclusions The discussed technique facilitated improvement of both the regenerative and the antimicrobial potential of fat grafting. It proved effective in surgically-untreatable infected chronic wounds unresponsive to conventional therapies.","Segreto, Francesco",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013127
태아피부 혈관 및 배양한 태아진피 미세혈관 내피세포에서 E-selectin 발현에 관한 연구,"Inflammation is the characteristics of scar formation which is abscent in fetal wound healing. The adhesion molecules such as selection groups are believed to have key roles for migration of inflammatory cells through the microvascular endothelial cells to the wound. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression of E-selection on the cultured human fetal and neonate dermal microvascular endothelial cells.
The back skin of spontaneously delivered dead fetus (IUP 18-22wks) and circumcised prepuce skin of neonate were used. Human fetal dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HFDMEC) were isolated by extracting microvascular segment from trypsin treated fetal and neonate skin tissue and isolated by sieving with nylon mesh and then by 35% Perocoll gradient centrifugation. Further purification was done with the Ulex europaeus I coated magnetic dynabead. To confirm the fetal and neonatal endothelial cells, expression of factor Ⅷ antigen on cell surface and uptake of acetylated low-density lipoprotein were checked.
Expression of E-selection on cultured fetal and neonatal endothelial cells in response to IL-1αTNF-αINF-ｒwas examined by ELISA. And the expression of E-selection on fetal and neonatal dermal microvascular endothelial cells was examined by immunohistochemical study using monoclonal 3B7 anti E-selection antibody in cultured fetal and neonatal skin.
The expression of E-selection on endothelial cells was not significantly different between fetal and neonatal endothelial cells. This expression was augmented 10 times more by IL-1αTNF-αINF-ｒ. Augmented endothelial E-selection expression by IL-1αTNF-αINF-ｒshowed peak level 4 hours after stimulation and return to baseline level after 48 hrs. This time course was similar in both fetal and neonatal endothelial cells. Immunohistochemically, the expression of E-selection molecule of unstimulated fetal and neonatal tissue was not observed. However, on both fetal and neonatal tissue cultured for 4 hours after stimulation by 100u/ml of IL-1 and 100u/ml of TNF, expression of E-selection molecule in microvasculature of upper dermis was observed and this expression persisted for up to 16 hours of culture. Also after culturing for 48hrs with 500u/ml of IFN, expression of E-selection was observed in the microvessels of upper dermis.
In conclusion, we could not find any differences between the fetal and neonate skin in the expression of E-selection on the endothelial cell spontaneously or stimulated by IL-1αTNF-αINF-ｒin vivo and vitro which means the expression of E-selection may not be an important mechanism of scarless wound healing in fetus.",나동균,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106908965
급성 열성 감염 후유증에 의한 안면 변형의 재건,"Acquired facial deformities due to Noma sequale are manifested variably according to the tissue necrosis nature, and reconstruction of the facial deformity is difficult by using simple approach when the tissue loss extended over a wide area to the face. The authors experienced reconstruction of complex adult facial deformities owing to Noma sequale by stage operation.
The first case was a 43 year old female. Her deformities were the loss of Lt. lateral alar dome, Lt. alveolar and maxilla, Lt. supralabium and cheek. The surgical prcedures were Washio flap for Lt. alar dome reconstruction at the 1st stage of operation, and Millard rotation advancement procedure for Lt. lip and supralabial reconstruction at the 2nd stage of operation.
The 2nd case was a 42 year old female. The deformities were the loss of anterior manidibular arch and teeth, complex loss of lower lip and inferior labiobuccal sulcus. Surgical procedures for this patient were alveolar ridge reconstruction by using iliac bone graft and labiobuccal sulcus reconstruction by using skin graft at the 1st stage operation. The 2nd stage operation was performed by using tongue flap for reconstruction of the lower lip defect.
The Authors are presenting two cases of facial deformity due to noma seguale for the following reasons in summary.
1. Noma survivor is rare nowadays and clinical reports of reconstruction that deformity in this country are rare.
2. Because the deformties or defects of these cases involve multiple facial units, we consider the experience of reconstructing these cases are invaluable.",설재윤,1992,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013290

1) The incidence of the mandibular condyle fracture was more frequent in males than that of females(five point two five : one).
2) The incidence of the disease based on age was the following orders; ten in the third decade(forty percent), nine in the fifth decade(thirty-six percent), three in the first decade(tweleve percent), two in the second decade(eight percent), and one in the sixth decade(four percent).
3) The incidence of the disease based on causation was as follows; nine by traffic accidents(thirty-six percent), six by an accidental fall down(twenty-four point five percent), six by fist blow(twenty-four percent), three by sliping on the ground(twelve percent)and by collision with trees(four percent).
4) Fifteen cases had unilateral fracture site and two cases were bilateral. The location of fracture line were seven cases on right side, twelve cases on left side, and fourteen cases on condyle portion, five cases on subcondyle potion.
5) Management was achieved by closed reduction in sixteen cases and one cases was treated by open reduction.
6) The cases were divided into four groups according to Yamaguchi's classification ; ten in degree 0(fifty-eight point eight percent), four in degree Ⅰ(twenty-three point five percent), two in degree Ⅱ(eleven point seven percent) and one in degree Ⅲ.

구개골절의 유형에 따른 치료방법,"The palatal fracture results in deformity of the midface, as well as change in occlusion. However, no report was found on the incidence, treatment and results of palatal fracture in Korea. A retrospective review was done over 6 years and 11 patients(6.5%) with palatal fracture were determind out of 168 patients who had midfacial bone fractures without nasal bone fracture. According to the Hendrickson's classification, the number of patients with specific types of palatal fracture was described as follows; sagittal(2 cases), parasagittal(2 cases), para-alveolar(3 cases), transverse(3 cases) and complex(1 case). Le Fort Ⅰ(6 cases), Le Fort Ⅱ(7 cases) and mandible(6 cases) fractures were also associated. Open reduction and internal fixation was applied to all patients. Internal fixation consisted of pyriform or alveolar ridge stabilization and maxillary buttress stabilization. The rigid palatal vault stabilization was applied in one patient with midline split of the palate. The duration of intermaxillary fixation was shortened to less than 3 weeks from 4 to 6 weeks with rigid fixation. The palatal splint was used temporarily before internal fixation. All the patients showed good bony union and satisfactoryocclusion postoperatively. Open reduction and internal fixation showed satisfactory results from the aspects of stability, occlusion, patient convenience and final aesthetics. The following treatment model for palatal fracture according to the fracture type is proposed; 1) Alveolar type - close reduction or open reduction and selective alveolar ridge fixation and selective application of palatal splint, 2) Sagittal type - open reduction and internal fixation of the alveolar ridge, maxillary buttress and palatal vault. 3) Parasagittal type - open reduction and internal fixation of the pyriform aperture and maxillary buttress, as well as selective fixation of the palatal vault. 4) Para-alveolar type - open reduction and internal fixation of the alveolar ridge and maxillary buttress. 5) Complex type - open reduction and internal fixation of the alveolar ridge, maxillary buttress, pyriform aperture and continuous use of a palatal splint to bony union. 6) Transverse type - open reduction and internal fixation of the alveolar ridge and maxillary buttress.",박상훈,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2012861
유리피판술을 이용한 진행성 반안면 위축증(Romberg's Desease)의 치험,"Romberg's disease is an uncommon condition manifested by progressive hemifacial atrophy of the skin, soft tissue and bone. Facial asymmetry with soft tissue deficiency in Romberg's disease causes a significant disability affecting the social life and can bring about many psychological problems. The aim of surgical treatment is cosmetic amelioration of the defect. Several conventional reconstructive procedures have been used for correcting facial asymmetry. They include fat injections, dermal fat grafts, silicone injections, cartilage and bone grafts, pedicled flaps and free flaps. We report our experience with 6 patients involving 6 free flaps with a minimun of 1 year follow-up who were treated from October 1989 to March 1998. All patients were classified as having moderate to severe atrophy. The average age of disease onset was 4.5 years. The average duration of atrophy was 5.2 years. No patient was operated on with a quiescent interval of less than 1 year. The average age at operation was 14.1 years, ranging from 10 to 24 years. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 9 years. Reconstruction was performed using 2 groin dermofat free flaps and 4 latissimus dorsi muscular free flaps. To achieve the finest symmetrical and aesthetic results, several ancillary procedures were performed in 4 patients. These procedures included Le-Fore 1 ½ leveling osteotomy, sagittal split ramus osteotomy, reduction malarplasty and angleplasty, rib and calvarial bone graft, correction of alopecia and additional dermofat graft. All patients were satisfied with the results.

레이노드 증후군의 치료에 있어서 수부 교감신경절제술,"Raynaud's syndrome causes discolorization, ischemic claudication(pain) and necrosis of the digits through insufficiency in the circulation which is induced by intermittent spasms of the digital arteries.From January, 2002 to December, 2004, 10 patients were surgically treated for Raynaud's syndrome. 9 patients were female and 1 patient was male. 2 patients showed unilateral involvement, 8 patients were operated on both hands. 6 patients had necrotic changes on the finger tips due to the disease. Ages ranged from 21 to 60 with an average of 39.1. Ischemic pain, discolorization, and cold intolerance of the digits were the common symptoms. All patients were evaluated with color doppler before the surgery. Two different procedures were applied according to the severity of the disease: Patients with decreased circulation received, what we call a limited digital sympathectomy, i.e. stripping of the adventitia of the ulnar, radial and common digital arteries. An extended procedure, radical digital sympathectomy, was performed on patients with a complete block of circulation. Stripping of the adventitia in these patients also involved the proper digital arteries.Symptoms like discolorization, ischemic pain, and cold intolerance improved immediately after the surgery. The patients did not suffer from pain even with exposure to cold weather.We conclude that digital sympathectomy could improve the symptoms in Raynaud's patients who do not respond to conservative treatment such as calcium channel blocker and other vasodilators.",이세환,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014573
괴저성 구내염 후유증에 의한 후천성 안면 변형의 재건,"Acquired facial deformities following cancrum oris sequelae manifested variably according to the nature of tissue necrosis. In cases that tissue loss extends over a wide area of the face, or the tissue nature is different due to congenital facial cleft, it is difficult to reconstruct with a single operation. As cancrum oris has virtually disappeared from our country, clinical report of reconstruction is also rare. We report 5 cases of facial deformities following cancrum oris sequelae.Since 1988, five adult patients(4 female and 1 male) were treated by authors. These patients, with an age ranged from 47 to 58 years, all suffered from acquired facial cleft such as facial mutilation, asymmetry. The stages of operation were from 1 to maximum of 5 operations. All surgeries achieved satisfactory results after a long-term follow-up. But one surgery in the case of palatal mucosal flap for the coverage of reconstructed maxilla alveolar bone resulted tissue sloughness, followed by osteomyelitis. Those were debrided and discarded.In conclusion, all sites of deformities were positioned around one of the oral commissures. In their past medical history, they have been suffering from measles, typhoid fever and unknown febrile illness. We diagnosed the acquired facial deformity following cancrum oris sequelae. The reconstruction of acquired facial deformity following cancrum oris sequelae were difficult due to extensive multiple tissue defects.

Use of Acellular Biologic Matrix Envelope for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Placement to Correct Migration into Submuscular Breast Implant Pocket,"Breast implants whether used for cosmetic or reconstructive purposes can be placed in pockets either above or below the pectoralis major muscle, depending on clinical circumstances such as subcutaneous tissue volume, history of radiation, and patient preference. Likewise, cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) can be placed above or below the pectoralis major muscle. When a patient has both devices, knowledge of the pocket location is important for procedural planning and for durability of device placement and performance. Here, we report a patient who previously failed subcutaneous CIED placement due to incision manipulation with prior threatened device exposure requiring plane change to subpectoral pocket. Her course was complicated by submuscular migration of the CIED into her breast implant periprosthetic pocket. With subcutaneous plane change being inadvisable due to patient noncompliance, soft tissue support of subpectoral CIED placement with an acellular biologic matrix (ABM) was performed. Similar to soft tissue support used for breast implants, submuscular CIED neo-pocket creation with ABM was performed with durable CIED device positioning confirmed at 9 months postprocedure.",Peyton Terry,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555860

A burn involving the full thickness of the ear leads to complete destruction or auto-amputation of the auricle and cannot be prevented by any form of treatment. Suppurative chondritis, on the other hand, may be limited extent or wide-spread. As it is a more common complication of auricular burns, much has been written about its recognition and management.

This flap, supramalleolar flap, is raised on the lower third of the log and is supplied by a cutaneous branch from the perforating branch of the peroneal artery.
It can be used as a rotation flap and a reversed pedicle flap. when it is used as a rotation flap, this is based on a cutaneous branch of the perforation branch of the peroneal artery. as for a reversed pedicle flap, it is based on a deep descending branch which anastomoses with a terminal branch of the anterior tibial artery.
We know that this flap is very useful for the treatment of various defects of the foot and the ankle joint areas.
This flap has many advantages then other procedures.

1. It can be elevated as a large flap(14 x 6cm in our case)
2. The vascular pedicle is long (8.0 cm) enough and easy to dissect.
3. The pivot point of the flap is distal (:sinus tarsi) and allows versatile rotation.

Negative Pressure Wound Therapy of Chronically Infected Wounds Using 1% Acetic Acid Irrigation,"Background Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) induces angiogenesis and collagen synthesis to promote tissue healing. Although acetic acid soaks normalize alkali wound conditions to raise tissue oxygen saturation and deconstruct the biofilms of chronic wounds, frequent dressing changes are required. Methods Combined use of NPWT and acetic acid irrigation was assessed in the treatment of chronic wounds, instilling acetic acid solution (1%) beneath polyurethane membranes twice daily for three weeks under continuous pressure (125 mm Hg). Clinical photographs, pH levels, cultures, and debrided fragments of wounds were obtained pre- and posttreatment. Tissue immunostaining (CD31, Ki-67, and CD45) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGFR]; procollagen; hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha [HIF-1-alpha]; matrix metalloproteinase [MMP]-1,-3,-9; and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase [TIMP]) were also performed. Results Wound sizes tended to diminish with the combined therapy, accompanied by drops in wound pH (weakly acidic or neutral) and less evidence of infection. CD31 and Ki-67 immunostaining increased (P<0.05) post-treatment, as did the levels of VEGFR, procollagen, and MMP-1 (P<0.05), whereas the VEGF, HIF-1-alpha, and MMP-9/TIMP levels declined (P<0.05). Conclusions By combining acetic acid irrigation with negative-pressure dressings, both the pH and the size of chronic wounds can be reduced and infections be controlled. This approach may enhance angiogenesis and collagen synthesis in wounds, restoring the extracellular matrix.","Jeong, Hii Sun",2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104555305
헤모필리아 A환자의 구순열 및 구개열 치료,"Hemophilia A is a relatively rare hemorrhagic disorder and the incidence is one in 10,000 males.
Hemophilia A, which results from coagulation factor Ⅷ deficiency, is the most common type among hemophilias.
Recent advances in hematologic treatment have no longer made it an absolute contraindication to any surgical procedures, including major plastic surgery, using prior administration of antihemophilic globulin. It is essential to titrate and provide hemostatically adequate level of the missing coagulation factor in the perioperative and postoperative periods, thereby ensuring normal hemostasis and postoperative healing.
The importance of meticulous hemostasis at surgery and careful monitoring of blood coagulability in the postoperative period can not be overemphasized. The authors treated a left unilateral cleft lip and palate patient having hemophilia A. We were able to perform palatoplasty and secondary cleft lip repair safely with a high degree of confidence.",금인섭,1991,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101435994
구순열 및 구개열 환자 악안면 교정 치험례(57례),"Cleft lip and palate are not infrequent in various craniofacial anomalies. Early surgery for the correction of cleft lip and palate is one of the important causes of retardation of maxillary growth.
As a result of the continues growth of the mandible, the rehabilitation of the cleft lip and palate patient may require a surgical procedure to correct the disparity between the maxilla and mandible.
The continued growth of the lower jaw in the presence of a hypoplastic maxilla results in a Class III malocclusion, which requires either a maxillary advancement or a combination of maxillary and mandibular osteotmies to achieve adequate facial contour and dentoalveolar arch form.
From March 1989 to Febrary 1993, 57 cases of cleft lip and cleft palate deformity were treated surgically, Among them 25 patients were treated by Lefort I maxillary advancement, only, and 32 patients by simultaneous maxillary and mandibular osteotomies.
We analyzed by clinical, dental and cephalometric examination as well as photograghic records. Combining maxillary advancement with mandibular setback results in to achivement of better facial balance and harmony when maxillary advancement greater than 8mm is indicated. The SNA was a increase of mean 6.0 degees and ANB was normalized to mean 2.5 degrees.
We have gained the result of good occlusal relationship, satisfactory facial aesthetic contouring.",정성훈,1994,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014012
Gluteal Perforator-based Flap을 이용한 Sacral Pressure Sore의 치료,"Sacral pressure sores have been treated by a variety of surgical methods. complete treatment needs wide excision and coverage with healthy tissue which has constant and sufficient blood supply. Use of gluteus maximus muscle flap with or without overlying skin is a revolutionary method because of the reliability of blood supply. However, it is technically a little bit complicated, and future reconstruction for recurrent decubitus is especially limited in paraplegic patients. The development of gluteal perforator-based flap with para-sacral perforator introduce a new treatment modality for the sacral pressure sores. Total 10 cases of sacral pressure sores were treated with gluteal perforator-based flap. There were minimal postoperative complications except wound dehiscence in one case. This flap has a many advantage of no transection or sacrifice of the gluteus maximus muscle, elevation time for the flap is short, reliable blood flow of the perforator, large rotation arc and no post-operative hindrance to walking in patients who are not paraplegic. The disadvantages of this perforator-based flaps are the anatomical variation in the location of perforators and the need for technically careful dissection.",조을제,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2012882
초음파지방흡입기기가 돼지의 지방 및 근육조직에 미치는 영향,"Ultrasonic liposuction has been popular for the removal of fat. Ten Yorkshire pigs served as the experimental models and the fat tissue in the back and abdomen and the biceps femoris muscle in the thigh were exposed.
The animal models were divided into 4 groups according to the mechanism of cellular destruction. Group 1: a combined mechanism of ultrasonic and thermal effects, Group 2: as same as group 1 except minimal thermal effect, Group 3: only the ultrasonic effect, group 4: only the thermal effect. Then the ultrasound was applied to the fat and muscle of each group. In the infiltrated group of Klein solution, the increase of the temperature was less than the noninfiltration group.
There was a significant increase of the temperature in the muscle than in the fat approximately one and half folds in vivo. Fat cells were destroyed more in the infiltrated group than in the noninfiltration group. But muscle was destroyed less in the infiltration group. The reduced weight changes of the destroyed fat cells were about 1.2-4.7% in group 1, 1.1-3.6% in group 2, 1.0-1.9% in group 3, 0.7-1.0% in group 4. There was no muscle cell damage in the group 3 and the degree of destruction was similar in the group 1 and group 4. Also light microscopic and electromicroscopic findings of muscles were similar in group 1 and group 4. These findings suggest that the main cause of the muscle damage is thermal burn due to the contact of the cannula. In the fat cell, the pure ultrasound effect of the ultrasonic liposuction was calculated as 57%. and the thermal effect 31%. But in the muscle group the destructive effect was due to thermal effect, and ultrasound showed minimal effect.
In the electromicroscopy, there was fragmentation and abnormal contour of the cell membrane, loss of the nucleus, many vacuoles in the fat droplet, and loss of aggregation between cells and scattered appearance of the fat cells. In the ultrasound liposuction, many mechanisms are involved and among them cavitation mechanism to weaken the cell membrane and thermal damage play an important role.",양완석,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014349
이식피부의 색소침착에 관한 실험적 연구,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the cause of the hyperpigmentation in the skin graft. The full thickness autoplastic skin grafts were performed on the dorsal region of the C57 BL mouse. The skin specimens were taken from the grafted and normal areas of the mouse on the 10th, 20th, 25th, 20th, 40th and 100th day after grafting.
DOPA, histochemistry was applied on the frozen sections of the specimens, and the skin tissues were processed for the electron microscopy.
The results obtained were summarized as follows:
1. Vertical preparations with DOPA histochemistry of the normal and grafted skin did not reveal any melanocyte until 30th postoperative day.
2. DOPA-positive dendritic melanocytes were first ovserved in the basal layer of epidermis from the 30th day grafts.
3. Ultrastructures of melanocytes revealed the developing melanosmes and rich celluar organells in the cytoplasm as well as long dendritic proceses.
4. Melanosomes were localized primarily in the cytoplasm of the melanocytes, and they are increased in number and scattered widely in the keratinocytes with advancing postoperative days.
5. Langerhans cells and indeterminate cells occured in the normal and grafted skin of 10th, 20th and 25th day grafts, but no melanocytes were observed in these skin specimens.",김진환,1988,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2014400
시체 해부를 통한 다리의 얕은종아리신경 동반동맥과 앞근육사이막에 존재하는 관통가지에 관한 해부학적 연구,"Purpose: In the 1990s, skin island flap supplied by the vascular axis of the sensitive superficial nerves had been introduced. For example, neurocutaneous flaps supplied by the vascular axis of the sural nerve and saphenous nerve have been used. But the flap supplied by the vascular axis of superficial peroneal nerve has not been used commonly. Because there have been few anatomical reports about the superficial peroneal nerve accessory artery(SPNAA), we could not apply the neurocutaneous flap supplied by SPNAA. The aim of this study is to investigate the anatomy of SPNAA, number and location of its perforators, and septocutaneous perforators from the anterior tibial artery in anterior intermuscular septum.Methods: So, we dissected a total of eight cadavers. Measurements were made of the positions of the dissected arteries and perforators from the head of the fibula.Results: In all cadavers the superior lateral peroneal artery was originated from the anterior tibial artery and contributed SPNAA. Arising from the anterior tibial artery an average of 5.63cm inferior to the fibular head, it varied from 10cm to 16cm in length. SPNAA gave off an average of 4.38 perforators to supply lateral aspect. In one case the inferior lateral peroneal artery was present and arose from the anterior tibial artery 18cm inferior to the fibular head. There were an average of 3.38 direct septocutaneous perforators from the anterior tibial artery.Conclusion: Septocutaneous perforators from SPNAA mainly exist from proximal 1/6 to 3/5 of lower leg. In the distal 1/3 of lower leg where the accessory artery was disappeared, exist mainly direct septocutaneous perforators from the anterior tibial artery. Our results can be helpful to applications of the neurocutaneous flap using SPNAA or fasciocutaneous flap based on direct septocutaneous perforators.",김준식,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2013664
橫顔面裂 治驗 2例,"Transverse facial clefts are unusual lesions that result from failure of the embryonic mandibular and maxillary processes to properly fuse and form the corners of the mouth.
The incidence of these defects was estimated by Blackfield and Wilde to be about one in 100 of all facial clefts, one in 80 by Ogo and Omori, about one in 300 by Fogh-Andersen, about one in 100 by Park etc. They were more common in males by Gorlin and Pindborg, in females by Ogo and Omori, more common in left side.
This condition of ten is associated with aberrant ear nodules between the corner of mouth and the ear, and sometimes with ear deformities, syndactyly, poly-dactyly, congenital heart anomalies, and rib and vertebral deformities.
Various surgical techniques have been described for their correction, but authors used the Z-plasty. It was very simple and the result was good.
Two cases report and review of the literature will be presented.",高一煥,1977,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104553992
抗癌劑 및 抗免疫劑가 投與가 白鼠同種皮膚移植에 미치는 영향,"Today, despite advances in tissue typing and the development of suppressive drugs, it is still not possible to have skin homografts survive for prolonged periods of time. However, only two types of homograft have been successful; the one is skin homograft between monozygotic twins, the other is skin homograft upon recipients with agammaglobulinemia. It is well known that the circulatory reestablishment of homografts take place during postoperative 4th day same as autograft, however rejection phenomenon usually occurs about 7 days after transplantation. There have been many challengers and reports about possible prolongation of homograft, but no fationating results had obtained. The authors investigate the effect of anticancer drugs and immunosuppressive drugs to the skin homograft in mice and the results summerized as followings.
1. Control group of hemograft survived for 7-11 days.
2. Mice treated with Mytomicin survived for 17.5 days, 5FU was 16.1 days, prednysolone was 18.2 days and Endoxan was 17.2 days.",李世一,1978,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2012335
