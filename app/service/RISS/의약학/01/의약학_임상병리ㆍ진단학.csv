지역 간 보건의료격차 현황과 정책과제: 간호사 활용방안을 중심으로,"This study was conducted to understand the current status of regional health inequalities and nurse supply and demand policies, and to suggest ways to supply nurses to regions where nurses are scarce. Secondary data such as academic papers, government announcements, and related laws were analyzed, and the results were reviewed from various perspectives to derive policy proposals. Health professions were distributed around large cities including Seoul, and those regions had relatively high health levels. However, the number of hospital beds increased steadily, mainly in the non-metropolitan area. This seems to be one of the reasons why there is always a shortage of nurses in the local medical field despite the supply of nurses, and it can be a factor that aggravates regional inequalities. In order to solve the chronic shortage of nurses, supply-oriented policies such as increasing the admission quota and utilizing inactive nurses, and demand-oriented policies such as regulations on the nurse staffing level and improvement of the incentive scheme for quality evaluation of hospital service have been implemented. In the past, the focus was simply on the quantitative expansion of nurses, but recently, policies that emphasize the qualitative aspect of nursing are being promoted. However, the policy for the distribution aspect of nurses is still somewhat incomplete. Therefore, to solve this problem, strengthening the nurse staffing level in medical institutions, promoting nursing policies led by local governments, developing standard wage guidelines, and training nurses as public health personnel were proposed.",최성경,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19562787

중환자실 환자의 연명의료중단 의사결정 상황에서의 간호사의 딜레마 경험: 증례 보고,"With the enforcement of the “Act on decisions on life-sustaining treatment for patients at the end of life” in February 2018, discussion on advanced care planning (ACP) has increased. However, as decisions on life-sustaining treatments are still made in the intensive care unit, deaths related to the suspension of life-sustaining treatment account for a large proportion of deaths in the intensive care unit. The nurses encounter challenges in supporting the patient's dignified death; they experience an ethical dilemma in the ambiguity due to a lack of guidance on legal responsibilities regarding decisions on life-sustaining treatment. In order for the nurses to perform as a supporter providing care to the patients and as a advocate during the process of decision-making on life-sustaining treatment, there should be a systemic change to ensure the nurses' participation. In addition, an open and continuous discussion should be proposed to cultivate nurses’ ethical sensitivity and moral courage. This paper reports two ethical examples related to the decisions on life-sustaining treatment occurred in intensive care units of a tertiary hospital.",안지영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100484952

병원 간호사의 이직의도에 대한 간호관리자의 리더십 효과: 체계적 문헌고찰 및 메타분석,"Purpose: This study aimed to examine effect sizes of leadership styles of nursing managers on turnover intention of hospital nurses. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines. Participants were nurses working in hospitals. The intervention involved nursing managers’ leadership styles; the outcome assessed was nurses’ turnover intention. This was an observational study design. Eleven databases were searched to obtain articles published in Korean or English. Of the 14,428 articles reviewed, 21 were included in systematic review and meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis and R software programs were used. Results: The total effect size r (ESr) was - 0.25 (95% confidence interval: - 0.29 to - 0.20). Effect sizes of each leadership style on turnover intention were as follows: ethical leadership (ESr = - 0.34), transformational leadership (ESr = - 0.28), authentic leadership (ESr = - 0.23), transactional leadership (ESr = - 0.21), and passive avoidant leadership (ESr = 0.13). Ethical leadership was the most effective style in decreasing turnover intention of hospital nurses. Conclusion: Positive leadership styles of nurse managers effectively decrease turnover intention of hospital nurses, and negative leadership styles of nurse managers effectively increase turnover intention of hospital nurses. The ethical leadership style is the most effective in decreasing turnover intention of hospital nurses; however, it requires careful interpretation as its effects are reported by only two studies. This study contributes to addressing the high turnover rate of hospital nurses and developing positive leadership styles of nurse managers in hospital settings.","조윤정(Cho, Yunjeong)",2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108562582

임상간호사의 자기효능감과 간호업무성과의 관계에서 조직공정성의 조절효과,"Purpose: This study aimed to examine the moderating effect of organizational justice on the relationship between self-efficacy and nursing performance among clinical nurses. Methods: In January 2021, a cross-sectional survey was conducted with 224 clinical nurses recruited from a university-affiliated hospital in Suwon, South Korea. Participants completed online-based, self-report structured questionnaires. Collected data were analyzed using multiple regression and a simple model of PROCESS macro with a 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval. Results: Self-efficacy and organizational justice were found to be significant predictors of nursing performance. These two predictors explained the additional 34.8% variance of nursing performance in the hierarchical regression model, after adjusting the other covariates. In addition, organizational justice moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and nursing performance among the clinical nurses. In particular, at low self-efficacy level, participants with high organizational justice had higher nursing performance compared to those with low organizational justice. Conclusion: Enhancing organizational justice can be used as an organizational strategy for improving the organizational culture in terms of distribution, procedure, and interaction. Ultimately, these efforts will contribute to the improvement of nursing performance through a synergistic effect on organizational justice beyond nurses’ individual competency and self-efficacy.","김주라(Kim, Ju-Ra)",2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101696121

메르스 감염 유행 후 상급종합병원 간호사의 외상 후 스트레스 영향요인,"Purpose: This study examined post-traumatic stress (PTS) and the factors affecting it among general hospital nurses after the MERS(Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic. Methods: Data were collected from 170 nurses who worked at general hospitals since the first reported MERS outbreak. The IES-R-K assessed PTS. Data were analyzed using SPSS. Results: The mean PTS level was 7.80 points (range: 0~88); 7.1% of the participants were at a high risk. Nurses who had been in contact with patients suspected or diagnosed with MERS had high post-traumatic levels; those who had been quarantined during the MERS outbreak had relatively higher PTS levels. Shift-work nurses had higher PTS levels than those with fixed working hours. Above charge’ nurses stress levels were higher than staff nurses’ stress levels. The results showed that factors including contact with an MERS-suspected or diagnosed patient, position at work, and working status of MERS-affected nurses explained 16% of the PTS. Among the main variables, nurses’ above charge position was the greatest factor affecting PTS. Discussion: It is necessary to develop intervention studies and programs considering these variables.

신규간호사의 실무적응지원 교육 만족도 및 역할 이행 경험에 관한 조사,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the satisfaction of newly graduated nurses with educational
programs and their experiences in role transition. Methods: Data were collected from November 1 to December
15, 2018 and 483 new graduate nurses working at 15 tertiary hospitals and 10 general hospitals participated.
For data collection, self-report questionnaires including the Casey-Fink Graduate Nurse Experience Survey tool
and satisfaction with education were used. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, and one-way
analysis of variance. Results: Satisfaction with education ranged from 3.09 to 3.27, and satisfaction with
preceptors was 3.45(maximum 4). The skill that new nurses ranked as most difficult during the first 3 months
was charting/documentation, and throughout a whole year, the top 4 difficult skills were cardiopulmonary
resuscitation/emergency response, ventilator care, end-of-life care, and prioritization/time management. In
comfort/confidence, new graduates felt most comfortable with support and least comfortable with patient
safety. More than 50 percent of new graduates experienced stress during role transition, and the most frequently
experienced stressors were related to job performance and personal life. Levels of satisfaction with education
and comfort/confidence differed according to the hospital type and number of preceptors for new nurses.
Conclusion: In order to facilitate the transition of new graduate nurses to professional nurse, an extended period
of education, systematic and standardized transition programs, and continuous support during the first year of
practice are required.",권인각,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108336130

중추신경흥분성 식욕억제제 사용의 부작용에 관한 신속 체계적 문헌고찰 : 의존 및 정신병 중심으로,"Objectives: Although psychostimulants for suppressing appetite have indications for a short-term use, long-term prescriptions are also frequently encountered in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to overview the empirical evidence on the safety of such psychostimulants. Methods ： A rapid systematic review was conducted using existing systematic review articles or clinical guidelines developed by adopting systematic review methodology. Results ： Four systematic review articles or clinical guidelines were reviewed. Studies on the safety of diethylpropion were all short-term. Six case reports reported psychotic symptoms. Phentermine, phendimetrazine, and diethylpropion have been withdrawn in most countries due to their side effects such as drug abuse and cardiotoxicity. Long-term prescription safety for phentermine or diethylpropion was not addressed in existing clinical guidelines for pharmacological management of adult obesity. Moreover, studies on the efficacy and safety of psychostimulants in the childhood and adolescence obesity management have not been reported yet. Conclusion : The number of studies on the long-term safety of antiobesity psychostimulants prescriptions was too limited to conclude their efficacy and safety for long-term use. Thus, long-term prescriptions of antiobesity psychostimulants should be avoided and closer monitoring is needed even for short-term use of psychostimulants in subjects with mental health risk.",조선진(Sun-Jin Jo),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103097946
