
전립선암에서 인체신경줄기세포를 이용한 Cystosine Deaminase 자살유전자 세포치료법 개발,"Purpose: Stem cells have migration ability toward cancer cells and therapeutic genes can be easily transduced into stem cells with viral vectors. Cystosine deaminase (CD) is the enzyme that transforms the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine to highly toxic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This study was performed to investigate the migration ability of CD gene transduced human neural stem cells (Hb1.F3-CD) toward prostate cancer after systemic treatment in C57B mice.
Materials and Methods: An Hb1.F3 with a retroviral vector encoding v-myc, lacZ was generated and transfected with recombinant retrovirus from the pMSCV-puro/CD. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed to evaluate the expression of CD in Hb1.F3-CD. In vivo migration assay after systemic injection of Hb1.F3-CD was performed in prostate cancer induced C57B mice using molecular magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and immunochemical staining.
Results: Transgene expression in CD-hNSCs was demonstrated. In vivo migration ability of CD-hNSCs cells toward TRAMPC2 induced prostate cancer was found using MR imaging and X-gal stain after implantation of HB1.F3-CD in C57B mice.
Conclusions: We confirmed the migration ability of HB1.F3-CD toward prostate cancer cells after systemic treatment in C57B mice. This finding may imply a possible novel selective chemotherapeutic strategy against prostate cancer.",송윤섭(Yun Seob Song),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100131752

비뇨기암 환자의 말기 암성통증의 이해와 관리,"Urinary tumors include cancers that commonly occur throughout the population, such as bladder cancer, kidney cancer, ureter cancer, and prostate cancer. The incidence of urological tumors in Korea is increasing. As the treatments of patients with cancer, such as operation, target therapy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy, are being developed, the life expectancy has been increasing. However, significant number of patients experience disease progression despite of existing treatments. Therefore, symptom direct treatment is crucial in oncologic era. Symptoms of patients with cancer vary but pain is one of the most common symptoms. Therefore, proper pain management is essential for the patients to improve the quality of life. Pain in cancer has as many complex pathological and physical characteristics as various tumor types. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions are important to address the full spectrum of cancer pain in patients. Many approaches to pain control, including opioid analgesics, radiation, and interventional care, are included in pain control therapy. Clinicians working with urinary tumors should be familiar with these pain control options. This review is intended to provide practical help to clinicians in treating patients with urological tumors. Updates to current knowledge and concepts of cancer pain management are included.",조재민(Jaemin Jo),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107304525
여성 복압성요실금 환자에서 수술적 치료 후 발생한 배뇨장애의 치료,"Purpose: We studied the voiding dysfunction after surgical treatment of female stress urinary incontinence
and diagnosis and treatment.
Materials and Methods: Three hundred women with stress urinary incontinence underwent surgical procedure
between January 1998 and December 2004. Ninety two patients (30.6%) experienced the postoperative voiding
dysfunction. As the primary procedure for the management of postoperative voiding dysfunction alpha-blockers
medication and clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) were performed. Then, hegar dilation and urethral pull-down
procedure were performed as a secondary measure. For the patients who showed persistent obstructed symptoms,
cutting of mesh or sling materials were performed.
Results: In 57 patients, symptoms improved by alpha-blockers medication and CIC. The others were received
hegar dilation and urethral pull-down procedure, and 29 patients were improved. 6 patients were not controlled
by conservative treatment, of which 3 patients underwent cutting of mesh or sling. De novo urgency was developed
in 12 patients. Anticholinergics were taken, symptoms were diminished in 10 patients after 5 months of medication.
Conclusion: Most voiding dysfunction after surgery may be effectively managed by conservative treatment.
In cases of failure, hegar dilation and urethral pull-down procedure may be useful within postoperative first weak.
Finally, cutting of mesh or sling must be considered in patient whose the secondary measure is failed. (J. Korean Continence Society 2005;9:40-45)",한동석,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101597333
전립선 비대증 환자에서 항콜린성 약물다제투여 및 중추신경계 부작용 조사,"Purpose: Elderly patients commonly receive multiple drugs compared to young patients because of high
comorbidity. Some common illnesses in the elderly with underlying diseases are complicated or aggravated by
treatment with anticholinergic agents. We evaluated the use of anticholinergic agents and their adverse effects
in the men with benign prostate hyperplasia.
Materials and Methods: One hundred-eighty four patients over 40 years-old who visited hospital for the
treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia and prescribed more than one anticholinergic agent from January 2005
to June 2006 were enrolled. The patients who took anticholinergics during less than 2 months or suffered from
psychiatric problems were excluded. One hundred-fifteen patients were included and all prescribed drugs were
classified and counted. The number of anticholinomimetic agents and their 10 adverse effects were checked.
Results: Mean age was 67.0±10.6 years and mean cormobidity diseases counted 1.1±1.1. Mean pill and
mean anticholinergic agents counted 7.3±4.3 and 1.8±1.1, respectively. Prescribed anticholinergic agents count
increased with patient's age (p=0.401). As the patients took more medications, they had higher possibility to take
anticholinergic agents. And as the patients took more anticholinergic agents, they showed more anticholinergic
adverse effects (p＜0.001).
Conclusion: Elderly patients mistakenly tend to attribute drug-induced changes in memory and cognitive function
to aging or comorbid conditions. Therefore prescribers should consider an anticholinergic agent's receptor
selectivity, ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, and pateint's medical history in elderly patients. Additionally
physicians can actively perform Mini-Mental Status Examination for evaluation of the patient's cognitive functions
under anticholinergic medication. (J. Korean Continence Society 2007;11:24-29)",홍우성,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104501062
Translation and Linguistic Validation of Korean Version of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice for Patients With Prostate Cancer,"Purpose: Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer have increased the patients’ stress level and decreased the quality of life. A variety of instruments are currently available to evaluate patients with prostate cancer. However, only a few tools are available to assess Korean patients, and therefore we demonstrated a linguistic validation of Korean Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP).
Methods: EPIC-CP was translated into Korean and the linguistic validation was evaluated. The evaluation process includes permission for translation, forward translation, reconciliation, backward translation, cognitive debriefing, and proofreading.
Two bilingual translators independently translated the original questionnaire, discussed the feasibility and naturalness of initial translation, followed by revision to the reconciled version. Another translator then performed a backward translation into English. Ten patients with prostate cancer completed the translated questionnaire and performed cognitive debriefing.
Results: The original EPIC-CP was translated into 2 Korean versions. The different wording in both versions and the ordinary words in the initial translations were changed considering the nuances and meanings of medical terms. During the backward translation, the panels made slight changes to clarify the meaning and nuances of the translated questionnaire. During cognitive debriefing, 10 patients answered the questionnaire and offered their opinions regarding comprehensibility and naturalness.
Most patients agreed that the translation was comprehensible in general.
Conclusions: Our study provides a successful linguistic validation of the EPIC-CP questionnaire. The translation is a helpful diagnostic tool to ensure the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer attending crowded clinics.",황영철,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106337215
Increased Expression of Neuregulin 1 and erbB2 Tyrosine Kinase in the Bladder of Rats With Cyclophosphamide-Induced Interstitial Cystitis,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in expressions of neuregulin (NRG)1 and erbB2 tyrosine kinase (ErbB2) in bladders of rats with cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced interstitial cystitis (IC).
Methods: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into the IC group (n=16) and the control group (n=8). After inducing IC with intraperitoneal CYP injection, expressions of NRG1 and ErbB2 were analyzed using western blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Results: In Western blotting, relative intensities and distributions of both NRG1 and ErbB2 were approximately 1.5- and 3.2- fold higher, respectively, in the IC group than in the control group (mean±standard deviation: 1.42±0.09 vs. 0.93±0.15 and 0.93±0.16 vs. 0.29±0.08, P<0.05). In the rat bladder samples, mRNA expression levels of NRG1 and ErbB2 were higher in the IC group than in the control group (P<0.05).
Conclusions: Our study has demonstrated significant changes in mRNA expression and immunoreactivity of NRG1 and ErbB2 receptors in the urinary bladder after CYP-induced IC. These results suggest that the up-regulated NRG1 may play a role in inducing an overactive bladder and promoting regeneration in the inflammatory bladder with CYP-induced IC.",송기학,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101597362
"Exercise Training Attenuates Ovariectomy-Induced Alterations in Skeletal Muscle Remodeling, Apoptotic Signaling, and Atrophy Signaling in Rat Skeletal Muscle","Purpose: The effects of aerobic exercise training on soleus muscle morphology, mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling, and atrophy/hypertrophy signaling in ovariectomized rat skeletal muscle were investigated.
Methods: Female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control (CON), ovariectomy (OVX), and ovariectomy plus exercise (OVX+EX) groups. After ovarian excision, exercise training was performed using a rat treadmill at 20 m/min, 50 min/day, 5 days/week for 12 weeks. Protein levels of mitochondria-mediated apoptotic signaling and atrophy/hypertrophy signaling in the skeletal muscle (soleus) were examined through western immunoblot analysis.
Results: The number of myocytes and myocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) were increased and the extramyocyte space was decreased in the OVX group compared to those in the CON group. However, aerobic exercise training significantly increased myocyte CSA and decreased extramyocyte space in the OVX+EX group compared to those in the OVX group. The protein levels of proapoptotic signaling and muscle atrophy signaling were significantly increased, whereas the protein levels of muscle hypertrophy signaling were significantly decreased in the OVX group compared to that in the CON group. Aerobic exercise training significantly decreased the protein levels of proapoptotic signaling and increased the protein level of antiapoptotic protein in the OVX+EX group compared to that in the OVX group. Aerobic exercise training significantly increased the protein levels of hypertrophy signaling and decreased protein levels of atrophy signaling in the OVX+EX group compared to those in the OVX group.
Conclusions: Treadmill exercise improved estrogen deficiency-induced impairment in skeletal muscle remodeling, mitochondria- mediated apoptotic signaling, and atrophy/hypertrophy signaling in skeletal muscle.",조은정,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107965156
2021 대한비뇨기종양학회 신암연구회 Consensus Statement: 전이성 신세포암의 종양감축 신적출술,"Purpose: The Korean Renal Cancer Study Group (KRoCS) provides consensus recommendations on the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy (CRN) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).Materials and Methods: A group of mRCC experts from the Korean Urological Oncology Society convened at the 2021 KRoCS meeting on CRN for mRCC.Results: The consensus document was developed to address 4 questions related that were judged to be the most relevant to patient care: (1) Is there a role for CRN in patients planning targeted therapy? (2) Is there a role for CRN in patients planning immuno-oncology agents? (3) When is the optimal time of CRN in patients planning systemic treatment? (4) What is the ideal patient selection for CRN? The panelists have come up with following consensus. For mRCC patients, CRN should be considered only in those with IMDC (International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium) favorable and intermediate risk disease, regardless of the systemic treatment plans. Timing of CRN should consider the risk group as well as the number of risk factors, but is generally recommended for after assessing the degree of response to initial systemic treatment. Patients with good performance status, limited metastatic burden on top of resectable primary tumor are candidates recommended for CRN with or without metastasectomy with priority.Conclusions: In conclusion, there is still a role for CRN in the multimodality treatment of mRCC. Careful patient selection is of paramount importance. As the treatment landscape of mRCC continues to change, the role of CRN in the current immuno-oncology era will require more exploration.",이찬호,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101597538
근치적 방광절제술 시 수술 후 조기 회복 프로토콜 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery,"Even with advances in perioperative medical care, anesthetic management, and surgical techniques, radical cystectomy (RC) which remains the gold standard therapy for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer, yet is still associated with a high morbidity rate as well as a prolonged length of hospitalization (LOH).

Relationship of Prostate-Specific Antigen Level With Obesity Indices in Korean Middle-Aged Population,"Purpose: We evaluated the relationship of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and obesity indices (weight, body mass index [BMI] and waist circumference [WC]) in Korean middle-aged men.
Materials and Methods: From February to September 2013, 1,900 police men under 60 years old who participated in a prostate health screening program were included this cross-sectional study. All subjects underwent clinical examinations including weight, height, BMI, WC, fasting blood sugar, lipid profiles, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and PSA. Total prostate volume (TPV) was assessed clinically. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression tests were performed to evaluate the obesity indices and PSA relationships.
Results: The mean age was 52.0±4.7 years, and the mean PSA was 0.97±0.99 ng/mL. The PSA showed a significant positive correlation with the age (r=0.108, p＜0.01), TPV (r=0.349, p＜0.01), height (r=-0.052, p＜0.05), weight (r=0.186, p＜0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=0.056, p＜0.05), and GFR (r=-0.096, p＜0.01).

2차 진료기관 비뇨기과의 현황 및 비뇨기과 의사의 역할,"Purpose: We investigated the characteristics of patients transferred from other department or other healthcare institution and tried to find a way to develop the role of urologist and department of Urology in secondary healthcare institution.
Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight secondary healthcare institutions were involved in the survey of questionnaire study which includes overall status of urology department and private information of 357 patients transferred from other departments of same institution or other healthcare institutions.
Results: The number of hospital bed was 267 and the urologists were at work for 4.7 years on average. In 35/38 (92%) institutions, only one urologist was at work for clinical practice. Average patients number was 39.7 per day in the outpatient clinic and the portion of urological patients among the outpatients were 76.4%. Average patients number was 20.6 per month in the inpatient clinic and average number of urological surgery was 18.6. The portion of patients transferred from other departments of same institution or other healthcare institutions was 16.4%. The answer which shows good communication between other departments of same institution was 78.9% and facilitating relationship among other healthcare institutions was 47.4%. Analysis of 357 patients shows that the period of symptom development was 26.2 months and the period of prior treatment in other department or institution was 5.3 months. Bladder related disease was most common and the next order of frequency were prostate disease and urinary stone. The rate of concordance of final diagnosis between urology and other department or institution was 52.7%, and rate of concordance of medication was 23.0%. The positive answer as ‘helpful"" for the prior treatment in the other department or institution was 41.2%.
Conclusions: The department of Urology in secondary healthcare institution has several limitations such as relative lack of man power and expertise, lack of awareness of patients or other physicians to urology specialty, and insufficient communication with other departments or institutions. In many case, urological diseases have been managed in other departments and it takes much limitation to help the urological patients.

Comparison of Ultrasound-Guided Transgluteal and Finger- Guided Transvaginal Pudendal Nerve Block Techniques: Which One is More Effective?,"Purpose: Pudendal neuralgia (PN) is a painful and disabling condition, which reduces the quality of life as well. Pudendal nerve infiltrations are essential for the diagnosis and the management of PN. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of finger-guided transvaginal pudendal nerve infiltration (TV-PNI) technique and the ultrasound-guided transgluteal pudendal nerve infiltration (TG-PNI) technique.
Methods: Forty patients who underwent PNI for the diagnosis of PN were evaluated. Thirty-five of these 40 patients, who were diagnosed as PN, underwent a total of 70 further unilateral PNI. All the patients underwent PNI for twice after the first diagnostic PNI, 1 week apart.
Results: In the ultrasound (US)-guided TG-PNI group, the success rate was 68.8% (11 of 16) in both “pain in the sitting position” and “pain in the region from the anus to the clitoris.” The success rate of blocks in the US-guided TG-PNI group was 75% (12 of 16) in terms of pain during/after intercourse. In the finger-guided TV-PNI group, the success rate was 84.2% in both “pain in the sitting position” and “pain in the region from the anus to the clitoris.” The success rate of blocks in the fingerguided TV-PNI group was 89.5% (17 of 19) in terms of pain during/after intercourse. There was no statistically significant difference in the success rate of the 3 assessed conditions between the 2 groups (P>0.05).
Conclusions: The TV-PNI may be an alternative to US-guidance technique as a safe, simple, effective approach in pudendal nerve blocks.",Ahmet Kale,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100131672
과민성방광 치료에 있어서 항무스카린성 약제들에 대한 문헌검토: 2009,"Overactive bladder is a chronic condition defined by bothersome urgency with or without urgency incontinence, usually associated with daytime frequency and nocturia. The treatment of this condition is to control bothersome urinary symptoms and is therefore to improve quality of life. The Korean Continence Society published the overactive bladder guideline in 2007, which suggested the mainstay of management is behavioral therapy and antimuscarinic pharmacotherapy. With growing awareness toward overactive bladder and quality of life, clinical information regarding antimuscarinic agents should be updated. There are several agents with good level of evidence and good grade of recommendation. Newer antimuscarinic agents are available or will be available in near future. The pharmacological properties, efficacy and tolerability of oxybutynin, trospium, propiverine, tolterodine, darifenacin, solifenacin, fesoterodine and imidafenacin are reviewed and discussed here.

배뇨근 저활동성의 복압성 요실금 환자에서 중부 요도 슬링이 배뇨에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze the influence on voiding symptoms when performing sling operation on patients with stress urinary incontinence with detrusor underactivity.
Materials and Methods: We analyzed medical records of 100 patients who received the sling operation. Based on their preoperative urodynamic study, we defined ""stress urinary incontinence with detrusor underactivity (SUI with DU)"" group as these findings; peak flow less than 11 ml/s or void with abdominal pressure instead of detrusor contraction or residual urine volume more than 100 ml. And the others were defined as the ""stress urinary incontinence only (SUI)""group. We compared two groups and analyzed the changes of pre- and postoperative uroflowmetry.
Results: The number of patients with the ""SUI with DU"" group was 30 and that with the ""SUI"" group was 70. In the ""SUI with DU"" group, there were no changes in peak flow rate and residual urine volume between postoperative uroflowmetry and preoperative urodynamic study (15.1 ± 7.9 vs. 14.7 ± 7.1 ml/s, 123.1 ± 79.2 vs. 127.3 ± 91.9 ml) (p>0.05). Twenty four patients underwent urinary drainage with nelatone catheter either on postoperative first or second day. However, 22 patients did not need to continue self catheterization.
Conclusion: Sling operation could be performed on patients who are diagnosed as stress urinary incontinence with detrusor underactivity without aggravating their voiding symptoms. (J Korean Continence Soc 2009;13:73-79)",이상협,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106172350
Case of Fournier’s Gangrene in a Patient with Long-Term Indwelling Catheterization due to Urinary Incontinence after Open Radical Prostatectomy,"Fournier’s gangrene is a life-threatening disease that needs to be treated as soon as possible. An 82-year-old male, who exchanged a urethral catheter once a month for urinary incontinence management after open radical prostatectomy, presented with an acute onset of mental change and general weakness. After ten days’ hospitalization, the disease was diagnosed. The scrotal wall was opened, and the infectious tissue was exposed to the air and kept open with an aseptic dressing. After 45 days, his scrotal wound healed and returned to its typical appearance without scarring and wound disruption. He recovered fully from the infection.

Urinary diversion is the prerequisite procedure after cystectomy and various type of urinary diversion has been introduced. Urinary diversion carries surgical morbidities, postoperative complications in terms of urinary function and sexual function, and issues for quality of life, which are important considerations for selecting urinary diversion. Ileal conduit urinary diversion and orthotopic bladder substitution have been regarded as the representative urinary diversion after radical cystectomy. There have been great efforts to compare the functional outcomes and quality of life between these two types of urinary diversion. Although orthotopic bladder substitution seems to a more natural and desirable urinary diversion, the currently available evidence is insufficient to draw a conclusion that orthotopic bladder is an absolutely superior form of urinary diversion. However, the vast majority of studies demonstrated that orthotopic neobladder urinary diversion shows at least equal or a marginally better quality of life scores compared to ileal conduit diversion. The favorable outcomes of orthotopic neobladder would be more pronounced especially when considering relatively young and healthy patients.",박상언(Sang Un Park),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106180374

일개병원에서의 비뇨기계통의 말기 환자의 임상적 특징과 완화적 돌봄,"Purpose: The end of person""s life can be one of the most important times in that life. Physicians, nurses and volunteer workers are not sufficiently trained, understood to be competent or confident in end-life care. The purpose of this study was to understand clinical characteristics, and the combination of active and compassionate therapies of end-life-of patients in urology.
Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 21 patients who died during the end-stage-life care at the department of urology of one hospital from April 2000 to January 2009.
Results: There were 14 males and 7 females. The most prevalent reason for admission was pain (17 patients). The average survival in hospital was 22.72±16.16 months, visual analogue scale was 7.61±1.02, admission number of last 6 months was 2.67±1.5, period of last admission was 17.06±15.22 days, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was 1 case.
Conclusions: Palliative care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and assessment and treatment of pain and other problems. It is very important to manage pain in terminal urologic diseases.

방광암 환자의 개인 맞춤형 약물 개발의 접근법 제시,"Bladder cancer, which affects the bladder mucosa, is the ninth most common disease worldwide. There are many types of cancerous tissue in the bladder. Most exhibit low malignancy, but their recurrence rate is higher in comparison to more malignant tissues. Only 10%-15% progress to invasive bladder cancer and metastasize to the lung, liver, and bone, which is significantly difficult to treat. The anticancer efficacy developed for the treatment of highly malignant bladder cancer does not equally apply to all patients, and the side effects vary. To solve this problem, studies have been conducted on various verification systems and patient-specific drug development. For example, an organ-on-a-chip model using patient cancer cells is being actively researched as an anticancer drug verification system. A study on screening anticancer drugs according to cancer biomarkers unique to individual patients is also in progress. In addition, studies have recently been conducted on immune anticancer drugs that exhibit excellent anticancer efficacy. This report discusses various validation systems and drug screening criteria for the development of patient-specific drugs. We propose that it is possible to evaluate the efficacy of anticancer drugs for each patient, understand drug mechanism patterns in humans, and develop treatment that prevents cancer metastasis.",설향숙(Hyang Sook Seol),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101597487
"Improved Urothelial Cell Proliferation, Cytoskeleton and Barrier Function Protein Expression in the Patients With Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome After Intravesical Platelet-Rich Plasma Injection","Purpose: To investigate urothelial cell proliferation, cytoskeleton, inflammation, and barrier function protein expressions in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) after intravesical platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections Methods: A total of 19 patients with IC/BPS underwent 4 monthly intravesical PRP injections. Bladder biopsies were taken at the first and fourth PRP treatment. The bladder specimens were analyzed using the Western blot and immunochemical staining for progenitor cell markers for sonic hedgehog (Shh), CD34, and cytoskeleton proteins cytokeratin 5 (CK5), CK14, CK20; barrier function markers for zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), E-cadherin, and intercellular adhesive molecule-1, tryptase and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Global response assessment (GRA) was used to evaluate treatment outcomes.
Results: The mean age of patients was 55.6 years. After PRP injections, the functional bladder capacity and maximum flow rate increased, and the visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, interstitial cystitis (IC) symptom index, IC problem index, O’Leary-Sant symptom score, and GRA improved in all patients. Urothelium Shh, CK5, ZO-1, E-cadherin, and TGF-β expressions increased significantly after repeated PRP injections. By subgrouping, according to PRP treatment outcomes, significant increases in Shh, E-cadherin, and ZO-1 expressions were noted only in patients with GRA ≥1 or improved VAS, but not in patients with GRA=0 and no improvement in VAS.
Conclusions: The level of urothelial barrier function protein and cell proliferation protein expression in the patients with IC/ BPS was increased after repeat intravesical PRP injections. Intravesical repeat PRP injections may have potential to improve urothelial health and result in symptoms improvement in the patients with IC/BPS.",Jia-Fong Jhang,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106846511
Role of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination for Prevention of Male Infertility,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause various diseases, including genital warts and malignant diseases, such as cervical, head and neck, and anal cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that a HPV infection can also adversely affect male fertility. The HPV has been detected in the semen and testicular tissues of infected individuals, indicating that the virus can directly impact the male reproductive system. Indeed, many studies showed that the HPV infection could cause sperm DNA damage, decreased sperm motility, and reduced sperm concentration, contributing to male infertility. The HPV vaccination is currently only being administered to females in Korea. On the other hand, the vaccine could help mitigate these negative impacts on male fertility by protecting males against HPV infection. This paper reviews the effects of the HPV on male fertility and the potential benefits of HPV vaccination in protecting male fertility.",Taeyong Park,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100475147
Analysis of Uropathogens of Febrile Urinary Tract Infection in Infant and Relationship with Vesicoureteral Reflux,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between uropathogens of infants with febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) and vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).Materials and Methods: We analyzed 308 infants hospitalized for febrile UTI between January 2010 and December 2015, and assessed the voiding cystourethrography (VCUG). The medical records, including clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, urinalysis, urine culture tests, ultrasound (US), dimercaptosuccinicacid scan, and VCUG, were retrospectively obtained. The incidences of VUR and high-grade VURs (III, IV, and V) were analyzed in 4 groups categorized by uropathogens and renal US findings.Results: The mean age of 308 infants was 3.29±2.18 months. The male-to-female ratio was 3.46:1. In urine culture tests, 267 infants (86.69%) showed single bacterial uropathogen; Escherichia coli in 241 infants (78.25%) and non-E. coli uropathogens in 26 infants (8.44%). Multiple distinctive microorganisms were identified as causativeuropathogens in 41 infants (13.31%). Abnormal findings of US and VCUG were identified in 216 and 64 patients, respectively. In 308 infants, the incidences of VUR and high-grade VUR were not different among the 4 groups. In 239 male infants, the incidences of high-grade VUR were higher in patients with non-E. coli single or multiple uropathogen and with abnormal US findings (p=0.042).Conclusions: In male infants with non-E. coli uropathogen or multiple uropathogens and with abnormal US findings at febrile UTI, there was an increased chance of finding high-grade VURs on subsequent VCUG tests.",Kyung Hwan Kim,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100475148
Outcome of Patients With Elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Receiving Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate,"Purpose: This study investigated functional outcomes in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), the incidence of incidental prostate cancer (PCa), and changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) in patients with elevated PSA and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
Methods: A retrospective review of a prospectively designed protocol for patients who underwent HoLEP at our institution from January 2010 to May 2020 was conducted. Patients were classified into low-PSA (<3.0 ng/mL) and high-PSA (≥3.0 ng/ mL) groups at baseline. Follow-up for PSA was performed at the sixth postoperative month. Baseline and postoperative clinical parameters, functional parameters, PCa incidence, and postoperative changes in PSA were compared between the lowand high-PSA groups.
Results: The baseline PSA of 1,296 patients (mean age, 69.7±6.8 years) was 4.0±4.1 ng/mL, with 712 patients (55.0%) in the low-PSA group (1.6±0.8 ng/mL), and 584 patients (45.0%) in the high-PSA group (6.9±4.7 ng/mL). Incidental PCa was detected in 82 patients (6.3%), with a similar incidence in the low-PSA (41 patients, 5.9%) and high-PSA (41 patients, 7.0%) groups (P>0.05). At 6 months postoperatively, both groups showed significant improvements in the maximum flow rate, postvoid residual volume, and all domains of the International Prostate Symptom Score (P<0.05). At postoperative 6 months, the PSA level significantly decreased by 66.6%±23.6% in all patients (54.3%±23.9% in the low-PSA group; 79.6%±14.7% in the high-PSA group) (P<0.05), and the PSA levels of 1,264 patients (97.6%) had normalized.
Conclusions: In patients with elevated PSA presenting with LUTS/BPH, our study demonstrated significant improvements in functional parameters and decreased PSA after HoLEP. The incidental PCa detection rate did not show a statistically significant difference between the low- and high-PSA groups. Timely surgery for LUTS/BPH without delay due to PSA monitoring should be considered.",이한이,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107730091

카테터연관 요로감염,"Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is the most commonly occurring nosocomial infection worldwide, accounting for approximately 40% of all hospital acquired infections. A fair number of hospitalized patients undergo insertion of a urinary catheter at some point during their stay, and the use of indwelling urinary catheters appears to be increasing. Instrumentation of the urinary tract is always a high risk factor for CAUTI. A urinary catheter compromises the normal protective mechanisms of the urinary tract and enables bacterial colonization/biofilm formation on the catheter surface. Bacteriuria may progress toward CAUTI, which has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital cost, and duration of stay. Unfortunately, many physicians are not aware of appropriate indications for use of indwelling urethral catheters as well as accurate criteria for CAUTI. These conditions could result in superfluous catheterization, a potential source of CAUTI, leading to unnecessary use of antimicrobials for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, resulting in emergence of resistant organisms. We discuss the overall view of CAUTI: definition, pathophysiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention, mainly including descriptions associated with the indwelling urethral catheter.",양승옥,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107048507
방광요관역류 소아에서 내시경 수술 후 요로감염의 빈도 및 위험인자,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of febrile urinary tract infection (UTI) after endoscopic therapy for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).Materials and Methods: Analysis of the clinical data of 88 children (128 refluxing renal units; male 60%, female 40%) in a single institution during March 2011-June 2013 including age, gender, sorts and volume of agent for injection, preoperative VUR grade, recurrent UTI, bladder dysfunction, nephropathy, postoperative VUR, urinalysis, and urine culture results was performed retrospectively. All patients were followed for three to 62 months (average 25 months).Results: After the first injection, the complete resolutions rate of VUR (by ureter) was 72.7%, consisting of grade I 4 (90%), grade II 11 (84.6%), grade III 29 (76.3%), grade IV 33 (66%), and grade V 93 (72.7%) ureters. Preoperative UTI and febrile UTI were present in 81 (92.0%) and 49 patients (55.7%), respectively. Preoperative recurrent UTI and febrile UTI were observed in 53 (60.2%) and 30 patients (34.1%), respectively. Postoperative UTI and febrile UTI occurred in eight (9.1%) and in five patients (5.7%), respectively. In multivariate analysis, only preoperative recurrent UTI (odds ratio [OR], 0.17; p=0.04) and bladder trabeculation (OR, 0.104; p=0.038) were independent variables after endoscopic therapy.Conclusions: Our data support that the successful endoscopic correction of VUR is associated with a low incidence of febrile UTI. The highest risk factor for post injection UTI is preoperative recurrent UTI and bladder dysfunction. Therefore, patients with preoperative recurrent UTI and bladder dysfunction require careful observation after endoscopic therapy for VUR.",구자윤,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108043784
비뇨기과적 수술 후 도뇨관 유치 환자에 있어서 국소 항생제 연고 도포의 효용성,"Purpose: Catheter associated urinary tract infection and discomfort is common in patients with an indwelling urinary catheter. We investigated the effectiveness of prophylactic topical antibiotic ointment for genitourinary post-operative patients with a urinary catheter.Materials and Methods: We investigated 112 inpatients between March 2013 and October 2013, who had an indwelling urinary catheter ≥24 hours after a genitourinary operation in our institution from medical records. Among 112 patients, 59 patients applied ofloxacin ointment to urethral meatus around the indwelling catheter twice a day (ointment group: 52.7%) and 53 patients did not (non-ointment group: 47.3%). All patients were examined by urine analysis and urine culture before the operation, urethral sweep culture after catheter removal, and severity of pain was recorded as visual analogue scale (VAS) score while having an indwelling urinary catheter.Results: Mean duration of urinary catheter of both groups did not differ statistically (3.08±2.19 day, 2.91±2.25 day). Patients with pyuria detected at pre-operative urinalysis were 22.1% vs. 15.1%, pre-operative urine culture positive were 6.8% vs. 9.4%, urethra meatal culture positive after urethral catheter removal were 16.9% vs. 13.2%, respectively, and all results showed no significant differences between two groups. VAS scores of the ointment group (3.52±1.66) while having an indwelling urinary catheter were significantly lower than those of the non-ointment group (5.61±1.75) (p＜0.001).Conclusions: Application of topical antibiotic ointment for genitourinary post-operative patients with urinary catheter had no benefit in reducing growth of urethral microorganisms, but it may decrease pain from an indwelling urinary catheter.",김유석,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739701
성매개감염병의 진단과 신고,"In 2010, the infectious disease surveillance system of Korea was faced with a series of changes. For sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, chancroid, genital herpes,condyloma accuminata or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), every case had to be reported according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Law passed in 2003. But the reporting system for STIs was changed to a ‘Sentinel Surveillance System' in 2010, except for syphilis and AIDS, due to the fact that reporting every case was not practically possible and their occurrences should be continuously monitored to ensure the early detection and control of these diseases. In addition, the public health improvement or control activities of medical personnel need regular feedback of the surveillance results. However, the efficient reporting or surveillance of STIs has yet to be successfully carried out because of special requirements such as the need to protect patient's privacy.

재발성 요로감염에 대한 비항생제 예방요법,"Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections affecting women. In a recent study of college women with their first UTI, 27% experienced at least one culture-confirmed recurrence within the six months following the initial infection and 2.7% had a second recurrence during this time period. Women with recurrent UTI have an increased susceptibility to vaginal colonization with uropathogens due to a greater propensity for them to adhere to their epithelial cells. Risk factors include frequent sexual intercourse, spermicide use, first UTI at an early age, and maternal history of UTI. Effectiveness of continuous or post-coital prophylaxis with low-dose antimicrobials or intermittent self-treatment with antimicrobials in management of recurrent uncomplicated UTIs in women has been demonstrated. However, antibiotics are the main driving force in development of antibiotic resistance and can lead to resistance of not only the causative microorganisms, but also the commensal flora. The increasing prevalence of Escherichia coli isolates (the most prevalent uropathogen) that are resistant to antimicrobial agents has stimulated interest in non-antibiotic methods for prevention of UTIs. We discuss the overall use of non-antibiotic methods for prevention of recurrent UTI, including the use of immunostimulant OM-89, a vaginal vaccine or estrogen, lactobacilli prophylaxis, and cranberry.",김기호,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108287725
여성 단순 급성 신우신염 환자에서 당뇨 및 당화혈색소가 치료 경과에 미치는 영향,"Purpose: We investigated potential difference in the clinical features of hospitalized female acute pyelonephritis (APN) patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The additional purpose of the study was to determine whether HbA1c has a role in predicting clinical outcome in terms of morbidity compared with those considered to have normal glycemic control in female APN patients with DM.Materials and Methods: Among the female patients who received inpatients care due to APN from January 2011 to December 2013, 282 patients (86 with DM and 196 without DM) were selected and their medical records were analyzed. Laboratory results (white blood cell, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c) were dichotomized. Primary outcomes for comparison between the groups of patients with or without DM were early clinical response rate and length of in-hospital stay. Subgroup analysis was also performed in DM patients according to HbA1c status (<6.5%, ≥6.5%).Results: In multivariate logistic regression analysis, DM was not found to show independent association with poor early clinical response or longer hospital stay. HbA1c was the common risk factor of poor early clinical response (odds ratio [OR] 4.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61-14.8) and longer hospital stay (OR 4.20 95% CI 1.52-11.60) in APN patients with DM.Conclusions: Strict glucose control may be more important prognostic factor than presence or absence of DM in APN patients. As a marker of prolonged hospitalization and poor early clinical response, HbA1c can complement the present clinical and laboratory parameters used as guide in the proper treatment of DM patients with APN.",배민호,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573748

Vanadium Yeast의 독성저감 효과,"Vanadium has been known as environmental polluants resulted from the burning of fossil fuels in nature. It led to toxic responses by prooxidant activitiy, inducing free radicals and the accumulation in the tissues. Recently, there has been growing interest in an essential nutritional requirement of vandium and especially the treatment of diabetes. But because of its strong toxicity, thease chemicals have narrow safety margin. In order to reduce metal toxicity, and increase absorption and biological activities, metal ions such as selenium and chromium were uptaken in yeast cells. In this study, Vanadium yeast was prepared by uptaking vanadate in yeast cells. Vanadate induced hematological and biochmical changes in the experimental rat blood were inhibited by the treatments of vanadium yeast. Lipid peroxidation and catalase activity were significantly increased in kidney and liver after a single intraperitoneal injection of vanadate to rats. However, these observations were apparently reduced in the vanadium yeast treated group. Vanadium amount in blood, kidney and liver after a single intraperitoneal injection of vanadium yeast was significantly reduced than that of vanadate treated group. In conclusion, vanadium yeast uptaken vanadate in yeast cells could reduce toxic<br/>
effects of vanadate.",박승희(Seung-Hee Park),2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573770
"Implantable Devices for Sustained, Intravesical Drug Delivery","In clinical settings, intravesical instillation of a drug bolus is often performed for the treatment of bladder diseases. However, it requires repeated instillations to extend drug efficacy, which may result in poor patient compliance. To alleviate this challenge, implantable devices have been developed for the purpose of sustained, intravesical drug delivery. In this review, we briefly summarize the current trend in the development of intravesical drug-delivery devices. We also introduce the most recently developed devices with strong potential for intravesical drug-delivery applications.",이승호,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573777
요로감염 환자에서 소아 및 성인의 원인균주 및 항생제내성의 차이점,"Purpose: Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infectious diseases in children and adults. It is widely known that most UTI is caused by E. coli. In most cases for those who underwent UTIs,empirical antibiotics were treatment of choice. But resistance of empirical antibiotics is increasing gradually.
The proper use of antibiotics is essential in the clinical field. We evaluated the antibiotic resistance of organisms causing UTIs in children and adults patients to provide the proper use of empirical antibiotics.
Materials and Methods: From January 2011 to December 2011, 749 cases (mean age was 27.9±30.2years) who underwent positive urinary culture tests were evaluated. The age, sex, results of urine dipstick and microscopic tests, urine culture, and antibiotics resistance were reviewed.
Results: 460 men and 289 women were evaluated. Adults were 310 cases (41.4%) and children were 439 cases (58.6%). Pathogens from the results of urine culture were E. coli (35.7%), Enterococcus species (25.8%), Klepsiella (12.9%). Antibiotics resistance rate of all pathogens was 29.8% and Pseudomonas (36.1%), with E. coli (32.8%) having the highest resistance rate of all. Ampicillin (61.8%), trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (42.6%), and penicillin (39.4%) showed higher resistance rates than other antibiotics.
The multi-drug resistance rate was 17.8% in total, adults were 17.4%, and children were 18.1%.
Female urine RBC and urine WBC counts were associated with UTIs from a pathogen which has resistance at to at least one of the antibiotics in adults. On the other hand, older age, urine leukocyte esterase and urine RBC count was associated with antibiotics resistance in children.
Conclusions: Gram positive microorganisms including E. coli were the most common pathogen of UTIs both in adults and children. Therefore, quinolones and cephalosporins are widely used in UTIs, however antibiotic sensitivity was reduced in this study and there was no difference in adults and children.
The sensitivity and drug resistance were changing steadily, affecting many factors and various pathogens gave rise to UTIs. Therefore considerations of many factors of sensitivity to antibiotics are needed.",남형종,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573757
Unilateral Multifocal Type 2 Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma in Adolescence. A Case Report,"Papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) can be classified into 2 subtypes (types 1 and 2), depending on their characteristic cytogenetics, immunostaining profiles, and gene-expression profiles. Compared with type 1 papillary RCCs, type 2 papillary RCCs are relatively rare and show more aggressive features. For those reasons, they are associated with a worse prognosis. A 13-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital with right kidney mass. A laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed, and results of the histopathologic examination confirmed it to be type 2 papillary RCC. Type 2 papillary RCCs are rarely found in unilateral and multifocal forms, especially in adolescence. Here, we report the unique case of papillary RCC at a young age.",Sol Yoon(윤솔),2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573736
항생제 Fluoroquinolones의 약동학 및 약력학에 관한 최신 정보,"The ultimate goal of antimicrobial treatment is to decrease the morbidity and mortality related to infection. Maximizing these outcomes requires an understanding of the complex interactions between the drug administered, the host, and the infecting pathogen. Pharmacokinetics, which deals with the disposition of a drug in the body, focuses on such parameters as absorption, distribution, and elimination. Pharmacodynamics more specifically focuses on the interaction between the drug concentration at the site of action over time and the resulting antimicrobial effect. Use of quinolones has increased in vitro activity against several important pathogenic organisms as well as augmented pharmacokinetic parameters. These properties result in enhanced pharmacodynamic characteristics and should improve therapeutic outcomes against selected pathogens. In this article the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic potential of these quinolones, particularly fluoroquinolones, is reviewed.",고영휘,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573733
근육침육방광암의 새로운 바이오마커와 치료 타겟에 대한 고찰,"Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is classified into a heterogeneous life-threatening epithelial tumor with a high rate of metastasis and a dismal survival rate. Dissimilarity in genetic or epigenetic environment of MIBC causes considerable uncertainty in cancer aggressiveness, progression, and response rates, representing this cancer especially tough to manage. Several definite cases consist of point mutations in genes encoding receptor tyrosine or cytosolic kinases and alterations in epigenetics machinery, including both methylated genes and respective effector enzymes. Considering the highly aggressive and invasive character of MIBC, various attempts have been made to accurately detect and treat the disease using radical cystectomy alone or in combination with adjuvant chemo- and/or radiotherapy including neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Nowadays advances in the field of immunotherapy with the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors have led to paradigm shifts in the treatment of MIBC. In current review, several published biological markers were introduced from diverse experimental techniques including gene expression profiling, mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and epigenetic alterations. Moreover, the clinical evidence of new therapeutic targets with focus on checkpoint inhibitor in MIBC was summarized. These markers may be the excellent tools to predict MIBC prognosis and drug-responsiveness in the near future.",하윤석(Yun-Sok Ha),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101573787
Heme oxygenase-1 유도를 통한 화학 암예방 및 세포보호와 그 분자생물학적 기전,"Heme oxygenase(HO)-1 is an important antioxidant enzyme that plays a pivotal role in cellular adaptation and protection in response to a wide array of noxious stimuli. Thus, HO-1 induction has been associated with prevention or mitigation of pathogenesis of various diseases, including acute inflammation, atherosclerosis, degenerative diseases, and carcinogenesis. Recent progress in our understanding of the function of molecules in the cellular signaling network as key modulators of gene transcription sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlyuing HO-1 gene expression. A panel of redox-sensitive transcription factors such as activator protein-1, nuclear factor-kB, and nuclear factor E2-related factor-2, and some of the upstream kinases have been identified as prime regulators of HO-1 gene induction. This review summarizes molecular mechanisms underlying HO-1 expression and the significance of targeted induction of HO-1 as a potential chemopreventive or chemoprotective strategy.",김은희,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75977064
콜타르가 함유된 페이트 사용 조선업 근로자에서 요중 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide와 대사효소 유전자 다형성에 관한 연구,"Although shipbuilding workers were exposed to a variety of genotoxic compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), limited number of studies were conducted to evaluate the biomarkers related to PAH exposure in painting workers in shipbuilding industry. One hundred and thirty three workers<br/>
including 73 employees using coal tar paints were recruited from a shipbuilding company located in South Korea. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene glucuronide (1-OHPG), as internal dose of PAH exposure, were measured by synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy after immunoaffinity purification using monoclonal antibody 8E11. Glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1 and GSTT1 genotypes were assessed by multiplex PCR. Information on demographic characteristics, smoking habit, diet, job title, use of personal protective equipments were collected by self-administered questionnaire. Urinary 1-OHPG were higher in workers using coal tar paints than in workers using general paints, however, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.20, Mann-Whitney U test). Urinary<br/>
1-OHPG levels in smokers were higher than in non-smokers (p<0.05 by Mann-Whitney U test) and there was a significant increase in urinary 1-OHPG levels with the numbers of cigarettes consumed per day (Spearman's correlation coefficient=0.28, p=0.02). Genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1 and GSTT1 did not influence the level of 1-OHPG in study subjects. Multiple regression analysis show that smoking is the only significant predictor for log-transformed 1-OHPG (overall model R²=0.1). These results suggest that workers using coal tar paints were exposed to significant amount of PAHs and individual difference in xenobiotic metabolism might affect the<br/>
levels of internal dose of PAHs.",이경호(Kyoung-Ho Lee),2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75977067
사람의 유방상피세포에서 TCDD에 의한 발암성 연구,"Dioxin represents a group of halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons of which 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is well known for its extremely toxic properties as well as ubiquitous presence in our environment and ecosystems. In order to better assess the carcinogenic mechanism of dioxin, we should utilize the reliable biomarkers that can precisely and correctly reflect multi-stage carcinogenesis. When MCF10A cells were exposed to TCDD (10 nM), expression of both CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 was induced in a time-related<br/>
manner. The expression as well as activity of ornithine decarboxylase was transiently induced by TCDD treatment. In contrast, the induction of COX-2 that is implicated in carcinogenesis as well as inflammation, was not induced by TCDD. In another study, gap-junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) was attenuated by TCDD treatment as revealed by the dye-transfer assay. Based on these findings, TCDD has both tumor initiating<br/>
and promoting potential in human breast epithelial cells in culture. Also, treatment of MCF10A cells with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene plus TCDD resulted in malignant cell transformation as revealed by increased anchorage-independent growth of exposed cells. Additional studies may be necessary to<br/>
assess the effects of TCDD on multi-stage carcinogenesis in vivo.",김정환(Jung-Hwan Kim),2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103572347
