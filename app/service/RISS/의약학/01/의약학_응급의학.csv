Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective, before and after clinical study comparing the clinical outcomes of LUCAS cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in IHCA patients. The return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) rate and 7- day mortality were evaluated to assess short-term outcomes. Additional outcomes included epinephrine dose, CPR time, and the number of medical workers participating in CPR.
Results: The number of medical workers who participated in CPR in the LUCAS CPR group was fewer than in the manual CPR group (manual CPR 9.3 vs. LUCAS CPR 4.5; P=0.001). In IHCA patients, no significant differences were obtained in the ROSC rate (manual CPR 46.4% vs. LUCAS CPR 31.4%; P=0.051) and 7-day mortality (manual CPR 81% vs. LUCAS CPR 86.3%; P=0.434) between the two groups. However, the median CPR time (manual CPR 28.1 vs.
LUCAS CPR 42.8; P=0.001) and the epinephrine dose (manual CPR 8.3 vs. LUCAS CPR 13.3; P=0.001) were significantly longer in the LUCAS CPR group than the manual CPR group.
Conclusion: Compared to manual CPR, CPR with LUCAS required fewer healthcare workers and had no significant difference in the ROSC rate and mortality in patients with IHCA.",윤종우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2057587
급성 심부전 환자에서 응급실에서의 장기 체류와 병원 내 합병증 간의 상관 관계,"Objective: A prolonged length of stay in the emergency department (EDLOS) is known to be associated with poorer outcomes in critically ill patients. However, this has not been proven in patients who visit the emergency department (ED) due to acute heart failure (AHF). We aimed to find out whether prolonged EDLOS is associated with major in-hospital complications in patients with AHF.
Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of AHF patients who were admitted to intensive care units (ICU) via the ED of a single academic hospital from January 2015 to December 2019. We divided the patients into two groups: EDLOS <24 hours and EDLOS≥24 hours. The primary outcome was major in-hospital complications, which included in-hospital death, application of continuous renal replacement therapy, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment.
Secondary outcomes included in-hospital death, prolonged ICU stay (≥10 days), and prolonged hospital stay (≥14 days) excluding ED stay.
Results: A total of 265 patients were enrolled. Of these 163 patients stayed in the ED for over 24 hours. The multivariable logistic analysis demonstrated that EDLOS ≥24 hours was independently associated with major in-hospital complications (odds ratio [OR], 3.296; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.291-8.413; P=0.013). Analysis of the secondary outcomes showed that EDLOS ≥24 hours was associated with in-hospital death (OR, 2.607; 95% CI, 1.005-6.759; P=0.049) and prolonged hospital stay ≥14 days (OR, 2.458; 95% CI, 1.303-4.636; P=0.006).
Conclusion: Our study showed that in patients with AHF who visited ED and were admitted to the ICU, prolonged EDLOS was associated with major in-hospital complications.",천왕성,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102553488
코로나19 예방접종센터에서 BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 백신 접종 후 발생한 이상반응 환자의 임상 특성,"Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has not yet been controlled and herd immunity through vaccination against COVID-19 has been considered the best option to prevent the spread of COVID-19 worldwide. We encountered several patients in our emergency department presenting with adverse reactions after COVID-19 vaccinations.
Hence, we investigated the clinical characteristics of patients with adverse reactions after vaccination.
Methods: In South Korea, 10,510 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was administered to 5,304 medical staff. To investigate adverse reactions, we reviewed the case report forms from the vaccination centers and the medical charts from the date of first dose administration until two weeks after the last planned second dose.
Results: A total of 187 cases, out of the 10,510, experienced adverse reactions and these were more common in females. Dizziness (44.4%), nausea and vomiting (28.3%), and fever (24.1%) were the most reported adverse reactions.
Immediate adverse reactions included dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, palpitation, sensory changes, and delayed adverse reactions included fever, myalgia, headache, nausea, and vomiting. The delayed reactions of fever and myalgia were significantly more common after the second, rather than after the first dose (P<0.01 and P=0.03, respectively). One case of anaphylaxis was reported. All adverse reactions improved after conservative care.
Conclusion: Our findings show diverse adverse reactions to the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, but none of them required hospitalization. However, since this vaccine has been manufactured using a newly developed technique, more research focused on the clinical significance of the adverse reactions is necessary.",최영환,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99830381

응급실로 내원한 약물중독 자살시도자의 자살 진정성에 미치는 사회적 요인 분석: 응급실 기반 자살 시도자 관리시스템 자료를 이용한 후향적 연구,"Purpose: This study was conducted to analyze the social factors influencing the ‘authenticity of suicidal ideation’ based post-suicidal care programs in emergency departments (EDs).
Methods: This retrospective study was an analysis using the data of patients who had attempted suicide and visited the ED in tertiary urban hospitals from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018. The variables examined included gender, age, history of previous psychiatric disease, suicide method, and the number of previous attempts. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors influencing the registration rate for the community-based post-suicide care program.
Results: Overall,1,460 suicides were analyzed, 177 (1.16%) showed a high authenticity of suicide. The social factors influencing the authenticity of suicide intent were the unmarried status of men and women, joblessness, history of mental illnesses, more than two previous suicide attempts, the influence of alcohol, and an attempt to commit suicide after midnight more specifically between 24:00 to 6:00 hours in the morning (p<.05). The factors influencing the severity of the condition of high authenticity suicide patients were low Glasgow coma scores (12 points or less), lactate levels, and oxygen saturation observed in the patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment and died (p<.05).
Conclusion: The need for evidence-based preventive measures and early assessment tools at the emergency medicine level is emphasized to reduce the rate of suicide attempts. If the results of this study are used in the management of suicide prevention, the evaluation of the authenticity of suicide intent will be more likely to be made at the emergency medicine level, allowing the severity to be assessed earlier.",지재구 ( Jae-gu Ji ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108249272
전산체계와 인터넷을 이용한 응급의료정보 활용의 효율성 분석,"Purpose: To provide effective emergency care, the emergency physician should get medical information as rapidly as possible. They could get medical data within a few minutes if all the data were saved as digitalized data. We compared the time spent to get medical information and the time to make a transportation report between a computerized system and a non-computerized system.
Method: The cases of 2,131 emergency patients who had been treated previously at Asan Medical Center (AMC) and who revisited the center were analyzed to compare the time spent getting previous medical information, and 241 cases of patients who were transported to another hospital after emergency care were analyzed to estimate the time spent making transportation reports and copying X-ray images. The data for the patients were estimated in two ways, using a computeriszed system and using a non-computerized one. The computeried group used the OCS (order communication system), the PACS (picture archiving communication system), the EMR (electrtonic medical record), and the web-based medical information system (http://cyber-AMC.net).
Results: The time spent to get previous medical information was 33.7±5.1 seconds in the computerized group compared with 1313.2±271.5 seconds in the non-computerized group. To get the X-ray images, 17.3±9.8 seconds was spent in the computerized group, where as longer time of 1432.8±317.6 seconds was need in the non-computerized group (p value<0.01). The time spent to make a transportation report was 172.8±32.1 seconds in the computerizsed group compared with 473.8±117.1 seconds in the non-computerised group. The time spent to copy the X-ray image was 67.2±7.5 seconds in the computerised group, and 613.4±300.7 seconds in the other group )p value<0.01).
Conclusion: By use of a computerized medical information system, the emergency physician can get medical information and previous X-ray images rapidly and effectively, and can make the transportation reports and slides of X-ray images quickly.",안력,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108117300
119 구급대원에 대한 병원 전 분만 및 신생아 처치 교육의 효과 및 만족도 조사 연구,"Background: Emergency medical service (EMS) providers often care for pregnant women at risk of out-ofhospital delivery and born-before-arrival neonate. The mortality and morbidity of out-of-hospital delivery is well established. This study was done to determine if there were some effect of a delivery and neonatal care education program on the knowledge and practice of EMS providers. Methods: The EMS providers working in the southeast Gyeonggi province in South Korea were received an education program of out-of-hospital delivery and neonatal care. The program consisted of pretest, didactic, manikin training, post test. Six months after the education, a follow-up survey was administered. A paired ttest was used to compare pretest and post test scores. Results: The study was completed by 56 EMS providers. The pretest average score was 80.4 and the post test average score was 92.9 (p<0.001). The percentage of correct answers on each questions elevated relatively equally in the post test regardless certification. Participants expressed satisfaction of the education program. This appraisal was maintained in the 6-month follow-up survey. Conclusion: These results suggest that EMS providers can learn information regarding the out-of-hospital delivery and neonatal care after a didactic and training session. Further study is needed to develop reliability and validity of test and determine how this information is clinically applicable.",노경희,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99830368
응급실에서 시행한 소변 독성 검사의 유용성: 마약을 중심으로,"Purpose: In Korea, it is predicted that the proportion of drug abusers among patients visiting the emergency room will soon increase. Several emergency medical institutions in Korea are conducting field urine screening tests for poisoning. In this study, we investigated the characteristics and usefulness of urine toxicology screening tests.
Methods: The medical records of patients with positive results for tetrahydrocannabinol and methamphetamine from urine toxicology screening tests at a tertiary university hospital from August 2016 to August 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. The subjects were classified into positive and false-positive groups, and their clinical characteristics were compared and analyzed.
Results: Of the 2,026 patients surveyed, 823 patients (40.6%) tested positive for one or more drugs. Among them, 12 cases (0.6%) were positive for methamphetamine and 40 cases (2.0%) were positive for tetrahydrocannabinol. The positive and the false-positive rates for methamphetamine were 66.7% and 33.3%, respectively. The positive and the false-positive rates for tetrahydrocannabinol were 2.5% and 97.5%, respectively.
Conclusion: Methamphetamine showed a relatively low false-positive rate in our study. Therefore, this test seemed to assist in diagnosing methamphetamine poisoning when considered together with the present illness and physical examination results. On the other hand, the high false-positive rate for tetrahydrocannabinol tests indicates that this test was unlikely to assist in diagnosing tetrahydrocannabinol poisoning. However, considering the growing trend of illegal drug abusers in Korea, it may still be useful as a diagnostic tool for identifying drug users.",이세규 ( Se Kyu Lee ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107846526

일산화탄소 중독 환자에서 고유속 비강 캐뉼라 산소치료 효과에 대한 예비 연구,"Purpose: Acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is one of the most common types of poisoning and a major health problem worldwide. Treatment options are limited to normobaric oxygen therapy, administered using a nonrebreather face mask or hyperbaric oxygen. Compared to conventional oxygen therapy, high-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) creates a positive pressure effect through high-flow rates. The purpose of this human pilot study is to determine the effects of HFNC on the rate of CO clearance from the blood, in patients with mild to moderate CO poisoning.
Methods: CO-poisoned patients were administered 100% oxygen from HFNC (flow of 60 L/min). The fraction of COHb (fCOHb) was measured at 30-min intervals until it decreased to under 10%, and the half-life time of fCOHb (fCOHb t1/2) was subsequently determined.
Results: At the time of ED arrival, a total of 10 patients had fCOHb levels ≥10%, with 4 patients ranging between 10% and 50%. The mean rate of fCOHb elimination patterns exhibits logarithmic growth curves that initially increase quickly with time (HFNC equation, Y=0.3388*X+11.67). The mean fCOHbt1/2 in the HFNC group was determined to be 48.5±12.4 minutes.
Conclusion: In patients with mild to moderate CO poisoning, oxygen delivered via high flow nasal cannula is a safe and comfortable method to treat acute CO toxicity, and is effective in reducing the COHb half-life. Our results indicate HFNC to be a promising alternative method of delivering oxygen for CO toxicity. Validating the effectiveness of this method will require larger studies with clinical outcomes.",김영민,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107790396
한국과 일본의 소방 구급 출동 및 구급인력 규모 비교 연구,"Purpose: This study aimed to compare and analyze statistical data on 119 ambulance runs and ambulance crew, which are the components of the emergency medical services system in Korea and Japan. Methods: Data from National Fire Agencies of both Korea and Japan were collected and statistically compared. Results: With regard to the ratio of 119 ambulance runs, Korea's ratio has been gradually and continuously growing beyond that of Japan (Korea 4708.11, Japan 4706.47) since 2014. The ratio of firefighting ambulances in Korea was 2.59 ($2.59{\pm}0.10$), and was 4.76 ($4.76{\pm}0.12$) in Japan. The ratio of 119 ambulance crews in Korea was 15.55 ($15.55{\pm}2.03$), and was 47.24 ($47.24{\pm}1.06$) in Japan. Among the ambulance crews, the ratio of paramedics was 33.81 ($33.81{\pm}5.85$) in Korea and was 38.86($38.86{\pm}4.10$) in Japan. Conclusion: The ratio of 119 ambulance runs in Korea has already exceeded that of Japan, but the numbers of 119 ambulance crews and paramedics qualified for special emergency treatment are still insufficient. Therefore, supply and demand policy that promotes the development of the firefighting ambulance service system is necessary.",백홍석,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2057555
응급실을 내원한 성인 폐렴환자의 중환자실 입원 예측 모델로서의 호중구와 림프구 수치비의 유용성,"Objective: Multiple criteria have been proposed to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and predict intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammatory marker actively researched as a prognostic indicator in various infectious diseases. This study assessed the value of the NLR in predicting ICU admissions among CAP hospitalizations through the emergency department (ED).
Methods: A retrospective observational study of hospitalized patients with CAP via ED was performed from March 2017 to December 2018 using electronic medical records from a single center. By analyzing the clinical data at the initial presentation to the emergency room, the predictability of NLR on the admissions to the ICU was compared with other preexisting clinical scores, such as PSI (Pneumonia Severity Index), CURB-65 (Confusion, Uremia, Respiratory rate, Blood pressure, Age ≥ 65 years), and APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II) scores.
Results: Of 599 CAP hospitalizations, 80 (13.4%) required ICU admissions. In multivariate logistic analysis, mean arterial pressure and NLR have significance in predicting ICU admission. The area of under curve (AUC) of preexisting clinical scores to predict ICU admission had a PSI of 0.70, CURB-65 of 0.58, and APACHE II score of 0.66. The AUC of the NLR model was 0.75, the highest among the preexisting scoring systems. Setting the NLR model as a reference value, the PSI and APACHE II scores showed no statistically significant difference in contrast to CURB-65, which showed less powerful predictability.
Conclusion: NLR is a simple, inexpensive, and rapidly available measurement in the ED, which can be used as a useful tool for predicting ICU admissions among patients with CAP over other preexisting clinical scores.",이다형,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107000963

병원 밖에서 발생한 급성 심장정지 환자의 생존결과에 영향을 미치는 요인 : 다수준 분석,"Purpose: This study aimed to identify the factors affecting the survival outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest based on the Sudden Cardiac Arrest Survey by the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2012 to 2016.
Methods: Out of 84,776 cases, 57,104 cases of cardiac arrest were analyzed. To identify the factors that affect survival outcomes after a sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), we performed a logistic regression using SPSS. We also performed a multilevel analysis using SAS to determine whether the survival outcomes were affected by the socioeconomic level and health index of the communities.
Results: When SCA was witnessed by someone, the possibility of discharge with survival outcomes increased by a factor of 4.54. If CPR was administered immediately in emergency situations, this possibility further increased. When defibrillation was performed before hospitalization, the possibility was increased by a factor of 10.31. The multilevel analysis reflected the personal and regional factors that had an impact on the survival outcomes.
Conclusion: Because the initial response in SCA is crucial, a community response system is essential before hospitalization. It is necessary to actively publicize and educate the people because the their understanding, sympathy, and cooperation in emergency situations play a role in determining the survival outcomes of the patients.",김효실,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103117511
응급실로 내원한 신경색 환자의 임상적 특징: 만성 신부전 진행 예측인자로서 단백뇨의 의미와 유용성,"Objective: Acute renal infarction is a rare and easily misdiagnosed disease. Scarce research has been conducted on the predictive factors and prognosis of acute renal infarction due to its rarity. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and laboratory findings of a patient diagnosed with renal infarction to predict clinical outcomes.
Methods: In this retrospective clinical study, we collected and analyzed the medical records data of 61 acute renal infarction patients diagnosed in the emergency department (ED) of Konkuk University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea from January 2007 to December 2020.
Results: Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; 93.3%, 28 of 30 patients) and D-dimer (77.8%, 28 of 36 patients) levels of the acute renal infarction patients were higher than the normal. Proteinuria was found in 26 of 47 patients. The only significant prognostic factor for the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in acute renal infarction is the ratio of the infarction volume to the total renal volume. Age, occurrence of AKI, and proteinuria were correlated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Conclusion: The ratio of the infarction volume to the total renal correlated with occurance of AKI. Age, AKI, and proteinuria were correlated with the progression of CKD.",김지현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107001444

지역 COVID-19 확진자 환자 발생수 변화가 응급의료체계 및 병원 밖 심정지 환자의 생존율에 미치는 영향에 관한 연구,"Objective: This study evaluates the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on emergency medical service (EMS) responses and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) outcomes.
Methods: This is a retrospective comparison study analyzing the OHCA data of a university medical center in Seoul during the COVID-19 pandemic period (January 2020-January 2021) and non-pandemic period (January 2019-January 2020). The EMS response time and OHCA outcomes were compared between both periods. Based on the weekly mean number of confirmed cases and their EMS response time, patients were classified into six groups and OHCA outcomes were compared.
Results: This study evaluated 309 OHCA patients (non-pandemic period of 146, pandemic period of 163). Significant delays in the EMS response and transport time were observed during the pandemic period. However, no significant differences were obtained in the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival at discharge (12.4% in pandemic vs. 13.8% in non-pandemic; P=0.722). According to the weekly mean COVID-19 incidence when patients were over 100, there was a significant increase in the EMS response and transport time, whereas ROSC and survival rate were dramatically decreased.
Conclusion: During the pandemic, the EMS service for OHCA patients was worse than before, with delayed and reduced survival for OHCA patients. We further determined that an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases (especially when weekly mean numbers were over 100) dramatically delayed the EMS response time. This resulted in a very low survival rate of OHCA patients.",김근창,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106484133
당뇨병성 케톤산증에 대한 임상적 고찰,"Background: Diabetic ketoacidosis(DKA) is serious acute metabolic complication and the most important cause of high morbidity and mortality of diabetes. The object of this study is to examine the clinical characteristics of patients with DKA who had a prior history of diabetes or not.
Method: Authers reviewed retrospectively the medical records of 49 cases adimitted to Kyungpook National University Hospital from January 1991 to June 1997 with a diagnosis of DKA and classified cases as type I, type II and newly diagnosed diabetics according to prior history of diabetes.
Results:
1. Of 49 cases of DKA, 24(49%) were classified as type I, 17(35%) as type II from data available in the medical records, and 8(16%) had DKA as the initial manifestation of the diasease.
2. The male to female ratio was 0.5:1 in type I, 1.1:1 in type II and 1.7:1 in newly diagnosed diabetics, and the mean age was 24.4 in type I, 57.9 in type II and 23.9 years old in newly diagnosed diabetics.
3. The mean duration between initial diagnosis of diabetes and the occurrence of DKA was 2.6 in type I and 6.9 years in type II diabetes. The occurrence of DKA within 2 years of initial diagnosis of diabetes was 54% in type I and 18% in type II diabetes, but the occurrence of DKA after 5 years of initial diagnosis of diabetes was 17% in type I and 47% in type II diabetes.
4. The precipitating factors of DKA were identified in 88% in type I, 76% in type II and 38% in newly diagnosed diabetics, and the most common precipitating factor was omission of treatment in both type I and type II(type I: 56%, type II: 35%).
5. The altered mental status was correlated with incresed osmolality(p<0.05), but not with other laboratory values such as pH, bicabonate, glucose, anion gap and dehydration status(p<0.05).
Conclusion: It is necessary to conduct early aggressive evaluation for early diagnosis and proper treatment of DKA, because DKA occurs in patients with prior history of type II diabetes and without prior diabetic history as well as patients with prior history of type I diabetes.",서강석,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2057594
