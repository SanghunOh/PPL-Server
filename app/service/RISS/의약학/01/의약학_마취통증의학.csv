감각통합치료에서 고유수용성 감각 활동에 관한 고찰,"The purpose of this study is to provide definition of proprioception, foundations and roles of neuroanatomy, and systemical review of proprioceptive activities in sensory integration intervention. Proprioception exists in muscle, ligaments, joints and skin and it plays important role in controling body movements and interacting with environment during child development. Proprioception interacting with tactile and vestibular systems contributes to the change of muscle tone, postural control, refinements of planning and praxis. Children who are deficit in proprioceptive processing would seek hypo-responsive proprioceptive input or avoid hyperactive one. Outcome of poor proprioceptive input would cause the problems of praxis and postural control. Because proprioception provides information about the position and movement of body and limb it is important for development of body scheme and motor planning. It also influences the arousal and emotional tone. Sensory integration intervention which provides rich proprioceptive activities will improve the level of arousal and enhance motor planning.",김진미,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105434882

감각통합기능장애를 가진 청소년의 작업수행에 초점을 맞춘 작업치료 사례,"Introduction : Sensory Integration(SI) theory, science it is developed by an occupational therapist A. Jean Ayres, is the one of the most popular frames of reference used in occupational therapy(OT) intervention. It has been proved as a scientific theory especially in neuroscience discipline through abundant research and practice. Occupational therapists apply the SI therapy with strong clinical reasoning to improve adaptive behaviors of their clients and try to link the adaptive behaviors with occupational performance in the clients’ everyday life. One of the manners regarding clinical reasoning is Top-down approach. In occupational therapy discipline, Top-down approach is well-reflected within two evaluation tools; Canadian Occupational Performance Measure(COPM) and Assessment of Motor and Process Skills(AMPS) and two models of practice; Canadian Model of Occupational Performance(CMOP) and Occupational therapy intervention process model(OTIPM).
Objective : The purpose of this paper demonstrates how SI therapy can be employed within OTIPM and how the OT process (evaluation-intervention-outcome) can be structuralized based on the Top-down approach. This single-case study recognizes the impact of a SI therapy for a male adolescent on his occupational performance.
Intervention Examined : “P” was 16 years old male adolescent with no diagnosis and junior of the high school when he was referred. P was always with mouth opened, showed difficulties in gathering things need to be prepared and managing and paying money for shopping, and his colleges dislike getting close to him because he can’t was his body well. AMPS was administrated in initial evaluation and reevaluation of P’s occupation performance, Bruininks-Oserestky Test of Motor Proficiency-2(BOT-2) was carried out to assess motor functions and perception skills related in sensory integration, and occupational therapist performed clinical observation in order to complement the evaluation quantitatively and quantitatively. Based on the evaluation, it is concluded that the SI therapy is primary means to improve P’s occupational performance, and three therapeutic approaches were constructed; restorative, acquired and compensatory approach. P showed improved motor and process skills in occupational performance after undergone the occupational therapy.
Conclusions : The sensory integration therapy was practical enough to build the bridge between the occupational performance(Top) and the underlying component problems (Bottom). The OTIPM was helpful to identify meaningful occupation for P and P’s family within P’s contexts, and the AMPS was valuable to analyze and clarify the cause of difficulties in the chosen occupational performance.","지석연 (Ji, Seok-Yeon)",2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106491855
