In Korea, the incidence of scabies has decreased from approximately 50,000 people/yr in 2010 to approximately 30,000 people/yr in 2021. However, outbreaks have been consistently observed in residential facilities, such as nursing facilities, particularly among the older population. The clinical manifestations of scabies vary depending on a patient’s age, health status, number of mites, and transmission route. Typical clinical presentations of classic scabies include intense nocturnal pruritus and characteristic skin rashes (burrows and erythematous papules), with a predilection for the interdigital web spaces, inner wrists, periumbilical areas, axillae, and genital areas. Unlike classic scabies, older adults with immunodeficiency or neurological disorders exhibit hyperkeratotic scaly lesions or an atypical distribution with mild-to-non pruritus (crusted scabies). Diagnosis of scabies is based on clinical symptoms and results of diagnostic tests aimed at identifying the presence of the parasite. Although a close contact history and characteristic clinical findings are suggestive of scabies, confirmation of diagnosis requires detection of scabies mites, eggs, or scybala.
This can be achieved through light microscopy of skin samples, non-invasive dermoscopy, and other high-resolution in vivo imaging techniques.",박진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100320597
설문지를 통한 만성 두드러기의 임상과 원인에 대한 연구,"Background: Although urticaria is a common disorder that affects as many as 20% of all people at some time during their lifetime, the etiology of urticaria is still unknown in most cases. Objective: We attempted to analyze the clinical characteristics of chronic urticaria according to etiological aspects. Methods: The study was carried out on 230 patients with chronic urticaria, who visited our clinic with urticaria between March 2003 and February 2006. The diagnosis was made by detailed questionnaire and limited laboratory and provocation tests. Results: Of the 230 patients with chronic urticaria, 138 (60.0%) presented with idiopathic urticaria, 53 (23.1%) autoimmune urticaria, 33 (14.4%) physical urticaria and 6 (2.5%) another type. Chronic idiopathic urticaria was combined with physical components in 97 cases (42.2%), and cholinergic component was the most common form. Chronic idiopathic urticaria and autoimmune urticaria showed a higher score than physical urticaria in the severity of disease, but there was no significant difference in the duration of urticaria. Conclusion: Our data shows the clinical-etiological aspects and classification of chronic urticaria. Although the symptom severity of chronic idiopathic urticaria and autoimmune urticaria is higher than that of physical urticaria, our data is limited to predict the treatment response rate or the prognostic variables of chronic urticaria owing to the short follow-up period. Further studies will be needed to identify the natural course of chronic urticaria. (Korean J Dermatol 2007;45(6):560∼568)",권현조 ( Hyun Jo Kwon ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106180982

한국인 50세 이상 여성의 안면 피부 노화와 생활습관 간의 상관관계,"Background: Skin aging can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic processes, and occur due to several factors. Although the interest in skin youthfulness is increasing globally, research on facial skin youthfulness and lifestyle is limited.
Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the association between facial skin youthfulness and biophysical facial skin parameters in Korean women over 50 years of age. We further investigated lifestyle factors that make people appear younger than their chronological age.
Methods: We surveyed the essential information and lifestyle of subjects by questionnaires, and measured the biophysical parameters of the facial skin. We then performed clinical facial assessments, and the values were compared with the chronologic age. The associations between age differences, biophysical parameters, and living habits were evaluated. Results: We identified a positive correlation between age and melanin index (r=0.245, p＜0.001) and erythema index (r=0.119, p=0.002). The melanin index was statistically significantly lower in the group without regular outdoor activities (144.66±43.24 vs. 137.00±55.48, p=0.043). The melanin index and erythema index were the significant differences that defined younger perceived age than chronological age. The perceived age was younger in the group who wore a hat when performing outdoor activities than the group who did not (3.70±1.84 vs. 3.40±1.94, p=0.034). Conclusion: To retain youthful skin, it is essential to reduce sun exposure, as this factor can affect the melanin and erythema indices by inducing photoaging. Therefore, avoiding the sun bia proper methods, such as wearing a hat and sunscreen during outdoor activities, is recommended to maintain skin youthfulness.

여드름 환자에서 휴대용 디지털 피부형광 진단기기의 임상적 유용성에 관한 연구,"Background: Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is a gram positive anaerobic bacteria which plays a key role in the development of acne. Therefore, culture of P. acnes from the acne lesion can serve as an important clinical tool for selecting antibiotics and judging the therapeutic response. However the conventional cultural method is not easy to perform in clinical settings. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical application of portable digital skin fluorescence imaging equipment in patients with acne. Methods: Total of 60 objects (33 males and 27 females) with facial acne were recruited. To estimate fluorescence color and size according to the acne lesion, digital fluorescence images were taken and analyzed with image analysis program. Also, we examined the species and the quantification of bacteria aerobically and anaerobically isolated from each kind of acne lesion. Results: Among the bacteria cultured, coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) was the most common (57.7%), followed by P. acnes (46.1%). Noninflammatory lesions (comedones) showed statistically significant correlation with red fluorescence and inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) with green fluorescence (p=0.004). The density of CNS and P. acnes were also significantly associated with fluorescence size (p=0.014, p=0.005). However, there was no statistical association between the strains of bacteria and the color of fluorescence (p=0.192). Conclusion: Since the size of fluorescence correlates well with P. acnes levels, we found the noninvasive technique of portable digital skin fluorescence imaging equipment to be useful in choosing adequate antibiotics and monitoring antibiotic therapy in acne vulgaris.

아토피피부염에서의 피부관리,"Background: Interplay of numerous constitutional and precipitating factors are involved in the development of atopic dermatitis (AD). Most of these etiologic factors are not controllable, but barrier dysfunction can be managed. Correction of barrier abnormalities has been accepted as a first-line therapy with effective anti-inflammatory therapy. Objective: We wished to establish standardized skin care guidelines for Korean patients who suffer from atopic dermatitis. Methods: The skin care guidelines were proposed by the Korean Atopic Dermatitis Association (KADA), with a particular emphasis for barrier dysfunction in AD from a review of more than 100 published studies and related documents in the clinical literature by a task force team (TFT) of the KADA. The TFT also evaluated the reliability of the studies based on scientific evidence and the size of the study populations. The TFT disregarded controversial findings and summarized all of the collected studies. Results: Skin care guidelines were proposed by the KADA, particularly for barrier dysfunction in AD. A warm bath for approximately 20 minutes was recommended once daily. Soap can be used two or three times per week and aggressive skin scrubbing should be avoided. A topical moisturizer should be applied at least twice a day. Immediate application of emollient is required after bathing. The donning of clothing made of cotton is recommended. Nails should be cut short to reduce skin damage caused by a skin scratch. Conclusion: Application of moisturizer immediately after appropriate bathing may be the most important treatment for skin care. A topical steroid should be used whenever AD develops. Nail care and proper clothing are also be helpful for the prevention of dermatitis aggravation. Proper ways to bathe, use of moisturizer and topical steroids and nail care and appropriate clothing were considered.

The Study of Age-related Skin Pigmentation Changes in Korean Female,"Since facial skin pigmentation is one of the visual characteristics of skin aging, it is important to evaluate skin pigmentation in the cosmetics and aesthetic fields. Several groups have investigated and developed the image analysis methods for skin pigmentation and some of the groups reported the age-related changes of the number and size of facial pigmented spots. However, they didn’t show the changes of the number and size of pigment spots by defined size, and there is no report for Korean female regarding pigmentation. A total of 194 Korean females aged 20 ~ 79 (48.97 ± 17.11 years) were analyzed for the number, size, and intensity of pigmented spots using various filters such as large high-pass filter and median filter in their digital facial images. There were significant correlations between age and total pigmented spot number (No.), size, and intensity (I) (pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.688, r = 0.645, r = -0.563), and significant correlations were also observed between the number and intensity of pigmented spots of different sizes. According to the ANOVA results, there were significant differences in the percentage of spot size of 2 ~ 4 mm2 and > 20 mm2 between 20’s and 70’s.

However, the method combining radiofrequency and infrared light has not been used widely for treating both skin wrinkling and tightening. Objective: To investigate the efficacy of a new nonablative Korean medical device, AntiLaxTM (Jeisys Medical, Seoul, Korea), which uses both radiofrequency and infrared light, on facial wrinkling and laxity. Methods: Thirty-three patients with facial laxity and wrinkles were enrolled in this study. Three patients failed to complete the three treatment sessions spaced 4 weeks apart so, ultimately, 30 patients completed the scheduled procedure. Serial photographs of the patients were obtained during the study period. A final clinical assessment was made 3 months after the last treatment. Punch biopsies of the treatment areas were obtained 1 week before treatment and 1 month after the last treatment in five patients who agreed to undergo skin biopsies. Results: Doctors` assessments of the photographs taken before and 3 months after the treatment observed marked differences in the effect of treatment on skin laxity, according to location, but no differences in the effect of treatment on skin wrinkling, according to location. The efficacy of treatment of both skin laxity and wrinkling increased with the number of treatments. Patient satisfaction scores paralleled the clinical improvements observed. Secondary benefits reported by patients 3 months after treatment included decreased pore size, reduced sebum secretion, and improved skin texture. The side effects were mild and limited to transient erythema, edema, and rare vesicle formation. Histopathologically, there were increased, thickened collagen fibers 1 month after the last treatment, as compared to pretreatment. However, quantitative morphometric methods are needed to evaluate the histological changes objectively. Conclusion: Noninvasive radiofrequency combined with infrared light appears to be a safe, effective method for treating skin laxity and facial wrinkles.

"비타민나무열매, 아사이팜열매, 망고, 레몬, 살구 및 블루베리의 혼합 발효추출물의 효능 연구","In this study, the cell viability, radical scavenging ability, elastase activity, moisturizing activity, and antimicrobial activity of mixed fermented extract of vitamin tree fruit, acai palm fruit, mango, lemon, apricot and blueberry as an active ingredient were measured. The experiment was performed at three concentrations(0.5 / 1.5 / 2%), since cytotoxicity was not shown at these three concentrations. Based on this, a radical scavenging experiment was conducted to compare with L-ascorbic acid, a representative raw material of an antioxidant material. The results showed that the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging ability was 95 .1 ± 0.6%, 94.3 ± 0.7%, 95 .3 ± 0.6%, 95 .1 ± 0.7%, 95 .1 ± 0.3%, 95 .5 ± 0.3%, and 95 .4 ± 0.4% respectively, when the concentration of the mixed fermentation extract was 2%. As the concentration increased at the three concentrations (0.5/1.5/2%) and the content of blueberry extracts increased, sample 7 showed excellent elastase activity at a concentration of 2% to 0.9 cm, such as retinol crystal, and moisturizing activity was also found to be 71.5%, 75.6%, and 81.6%, respectively. Particularly, at the 2% concentration of the mixed fermented extract, the antibacterial activity effect on Propionibacterium was very excellent in sample 7. Therefore, it is considered that it is worth developing the mixed fermented extracts of 2% concentration as a cosmetic component with antioxidant, moisturizing, and antibacterial properties.",김수창,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106170465
선천성 매독 : 매독에 감염된 산모에서 태어난 태아의 운명과 조기 선천성 매독의 임상증세,"A retrospective study was made of the medical records of 114 pregnant women with untreated syphilis and their offsprings, and 19 pregnant women with treated syphilis and their offsprings at Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine during the years 1972 through 1981. We analyzed the outcornes of offsprings from both untreated
and treated syphilitic mothers and the clinical manife- stations of early congenital syphilis. The results obtained were as follows: Of 30 offsprings from 30 untreated syphilitic mothers with VDRL titer below 1: 4, six(20%) had congenital syphilis, one(3%) was a stillbirth, and twenty-three were normal infants. Of 84 offsprings from 84
untreated syphilitic mothers with VDRL titer above 1: 8, fifty-six(67g) had congenital syphilis, ten(12g,) were neonatal deaths, and eighteen(21%) were stillbirths, Normal infants were not observed. The mean weight ratio of placenta to fetus was 0 29 in g8 offsprings from syphilitic mothers. The ratios were as follows: 0. 25 in 14 living infants with con- genital syphilis, 0. 27 in 5 neonatal deaths, and (), 33 in 19 stillbirths respectively. 3, Of 19 pregnant women with treated syphilis, the qualitative tests of
VDRL were all reactive except for one case and the quantitatis e tests of VDRL were 1: 1 weakly reactive to 1: 4 reactive. FTA-ABS tests demonstrated reactive results in all cases. The qualitative tests of VDRL in the infeants of the treated mothers were 1:

밴드갭이 제어된 TiO2 를 이용한 자외선 차단제의 블루라이트 차단 및 SPF 부스팅 효과,"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is commonly used in sunscreen formulations to protect the skin surface and prevent the penetration of harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays by the physical scattering action of light. However, a disadvantage of using TiO2 is that it can cause white turbidity when used on skin due to its inactive mineral ingredient. In addition, when TiO2 particles are reduced to nanosize to eliminate opacity, they can increase the transmittance of visible light and reduce whitening, but may lead to serious skin problems, such as allergic inflammation. To overcome these issues, the bandgap of TiO2 was controlled by adjusting the amount of oxygen defect and nitrogen amount, resulting in color TiO2 tailored to the skin. This innovative technology can reduce the whitening phenomenon and effectively block blue light, which is known to cause skin aging by inducing active oxygen. The bandgap controlled TiO2 compounds proposed in this study are hypoallergenic, broad-spectrum, and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, these compounds have been shown to significantly enhance sun protection factor (SPF) of sunscreens, demonstrating their compatibility with blue light blocking products.",왕성은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75121735
아토피피부염 환자에서 바퀴벌레 항원의 기제 및 농도에 따른 아토피 첩포검사,"Background: Recent studies have attempted to document the correlation of an atopy patch test (APT) and a skin prick test. The results have suggested a possible role of delayed allergic reaction in the development of eczematous skin lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of APT with skin prick test and specific IgE for cockroach antigen. And we attempted to find the optimal vehicle and concentration of APT for cockroach allergy in AD patient. Methods: We performed APTs in 50 patients with AD with using German cockroach allergens (the extract with different concentrations and vehicles). The reactions were evaluated after 48 hours, and these were compared with the results of the skin prick test and the total and specific IgE levels. Results: The AD patients who had cockroach allergy, according to a skin prick test or the specific IgE level, showed higher positive APT reactionsthan the non-allergic patients to cockroach. The APT reactions showed a significant relationship with the skin prick test and the specific IgE level (85.7%). With regard to the form of cockroach antigen, a positive APT was more frequent with using the powder form that with using the extract. Regarding the vehicle, petrolatum induced higher positive APT reactions than did distilled water. There was a close relationship between the antigen concentration in petrolatum base and a positive APT reaction. Ten and fifty percent cockroach antigen elicited positive APT reactions than did 1% cockroach antigen with using a petrolatum base. Conclusion: Petrolatum is an optimal vehicle for an APT for cockroach because an APT with a petrolatum base revealed the highest correlation with cockroach allergy. The dose-response relationship between antigen concentration and the frequencies of positive APT reactions demonstrated that 10% and 50% cockroach antigen is superior to 1% cockroach antigen.

합성 세라마이드가 두피에 미치는 임상적 영향에 대한 비교 관찰,"Background: Ceramide offers an important barrier function to the epidermis. It can reduce epidermal water loss and inhibit the production of dandruff. Ceramide is essential in protecting hair and can be used as a cosmetic ingredient to improve seborrheic dermatitis and uncomfortable symptoms.
Objective: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of synthetic ceramide on dandruff, erythema, sebum secretion, and scalp water loss.
Methods: We enrolled 20 subjects. Ten were randomly assigned to a group using a synthetic ceramide containing shampoo and the other 10 were assigned to the control group. The subjects underwent evaluation of the scalp before the trial and after using the shampoo for 4 weeks. Scores were given for dandruff and scalp erythema. Sebum secretions were evaluated using a sebumeter and were checked at four different scalp sites. The water content of the scalp was measured using a corneometer at the same sites.
Results: After 4 weeks, 8 patients showed favorable outcomes in dandruff in the ceramide group compared to 4 patients in the control group. Four patients displayed favorable outcomes in erythema in the ceramide group compared to 3 patients in the control group. Sebum secretion increased in the ceramide group and decreased in the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The water content showed a tendency to increase in the ceramide group, whereas the water content significantly decreased in the control group.
Conclusion: These results indicate that synthetic ceramide is effective at improving dandruff, erythema, and reducing scalp water loss. (Korean J Dermatol 2021;59(4):277∼283)",박혜리 ( Hye Ree Park ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108653267
Epidemiology of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 and Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Infections: A Single-Center Retrospective Study in Korea,"Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a common viral disease of the skin worldwide. HSV type 1 (HSV-1) has been associated with orofacial infections, while HSV type 2 (HSV-2) accounts for the main cause of genital herpes. However, a number of recent clinical studies have revealed that the epidemiology of HSV-1 and HSV-2 is changing.
Objective: We performed the study to find out if there is any correlation between HSV subtypes and other multiple variables.
Methods: We examined the results of HSV-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests performed in our hospital from July 2017 through June 2020. We analyzed the HSV subtypes of samples from 304 patients that showed positive HSV-PCR. Comparative analysis was performed to identify the correlation between HSV subtypes and other multiple variables.
Results: HSV-1 was typed in 53.9% (164/304) and HSV-2 in 46.1% (140/304) of the patients during the study period. HSV-1 showed predilection for body area above the waist, whereas HSV-2 was dominant below the waist. There was a statistically significant correlation between the HSV subtypes and site of infection (p＜0.001). Female patients were more likely to acquire HSV-2 infection than male patients (p=0.027). The ratio of HSV-2 infection tended to get bigger as the age of patients increased (p＜0.001). There was not a significant difference in HSV subtypes among the groups defined according to immune status (p=0.333).
Conclusion: Our study provided abundant data concerning various aspects of epidemiology of HSV infection. They can be used to plan and evaluate strategies for management of patients. (Korean J Dermatol 2021;59(6):462∼467)",( Dong Seok Shin ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3288387
1% Zinc Pyrithione 샴푸의 비듬 치료 효과에 관한 연구,"Background: Dandruff is a common complaint, and is suffered by up to 50% of the population at some time. Malassezia yeasts, which comprise part of the normal skin flora, might be a critical factor in this disease, as they have been found in higher proportions in patients with seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff, its milder form. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of 4 weeks of treatment with 1% zinc pyrithione (ZP) shampoo. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, 4-week treatment period was preceded by a 1-week run-in period. A total of 30 patients were enrolled in this study. Assessments included the patient`s subjective score (PSS) and the investigator`s assessment score (IAS), images of the affected scalp area, the severity of sebum production, and the erythema and moisturizing effect of the shampoo. Results: 1% ZP shampoo significantly reduced the extent and severity of scaling, as measured by folliscope imaging on visit 2 (p=0.0391) and visit 3 (p=0.0381), as well as pruritus related to the disease as measured by the grading systems, PSS (p=0.0352) and IAS (p=0.0142). Additionally, the results of this study show that a treatment regimen with 1% ZP shampoo significantly reduced scalp sebum production as measured by a sebumeter. Erythema measured by the chromameter was not as meaningful. The corneometric values were slightly increased in the group treated with 1% ZP shampoo but not in the group treated with ZP-free shampoo. Side effects of the ZP shampoo were quite mild and tolerable, and were observed only in a small group of patients. Conclusion: 1% ZP shampoo appears to be both effective and well-tolerated when used for the treatment of dandruff.

영상분석법을 이용한 노화에 따른 피부주름의 변화에 대한 연구,"Background: The confgurations of the skin surface, as characterized by surface furrows and plateaux, are known to change with ageing. There are many parameters to analyze the effects of ageing processes on the surface configuration. However, there are contradictory results among the authors. Objective : The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of various parameters being described in other reports with our new parameters used in evaluating the changes of the skin surface in the agein processes. Methods : 112 healthy Korean males in 4 age groups participated in this study. Silicon skin replicas were taken from medial and lateral aspects of the forearm. Images of the skin replicas were analyzed by means of a digital image processing system(AIC, GA). Most parameters were calculated and measured in the primary skin axis. Image analyses were porformed by 3 different processes i.e., morphometry, densitometry(optical profilometry), and histograms. Results.In Morphometry, the furrow count in the vertical section(VFC), the coefficient of the developed skin surface(CDSS) and mean width at maximal interception(MWMI) showed a tendencies to decrease with ageing.Irregularity of shadow shape(ISS) showed a tendency to increase with ageing. In Densitometry, the mean surface roughness(Ra) and mean depth of roughness(Rz) showed a tendency to increase with ageing. On histogram analysis, skewness was decreased with ageing but kurtosis did not show any significant changes. Conclusion :Ra, Rz, and ISS have shown a tendency to increase in the ageing processes(p<0. 05). VFC, CDSS, MWMI and skewness showed tendencies to decrease with ageing but the results were not statistically significant. The different results between morphometry and densitometry are likely to be due to increrr ent angles in the skin furrows with ageing.

Pullulan과 Polysaccharides를 이용한 천연화장품용 필 오프 팩의 제조 및 특성,"In this study, for a natural cosmetics market, we sought to explore alternatives that can replace polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) of peel-off packs. A peel-off type pack was prepared by combining pullulan, a water-soluble polysaccharide, and other polysaccharides (sodium hyaluronate, cellulose gum, hydroxyethyl cellulose, sodium alginate, corn starch), and the pH, viscosity, and stability against temperature of each peel-off type pack were confirmed. The thickness and tensile strength of the manufactured film were measured for comparison with the PVA peel-off type pack, and applicability, drying speed, and removal degree were measured. Among them, the pullulan-sodium hyaluronate peel-off type pack showed excellent film formation ability to replace the peel-off type pack containing PVA with 5.12% thin film thickness and 4.23% high film tensile strength. When applied to actual skin, the degree of spread of the pack, the usability that can be uniformly applied, and the formation and removal strength of the film when removed after drying were also similar to the peel-off type pack containing PVA. Therefore, it was confirmed that the film formed of pullulan-sodium hyaluronate showed enough physical properties to replace the PVA of the peel-off type pack as a natural peel-off type pack.",곽준수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106159087

Objective: We evaluated the effectiveness of IPs during the acute phase of HZ for reducing HZ-related pain. Methods: Sixty-one patients with acute HZ were assessed using the pain visual analogue scale (VAS) that ranges from 0 to 10 at the initial visit and after 1, 3 and 6 months. Changes in pain VAS and the incidence of PHN (pain after 1 month) were compared between 2 patient groups: those who received standard therapy with oral antivirals and analgesics (ST, n=38) and those who received standard therapy with IPs (STIPs, n=23). PHN was defined as either “pain of 1 or higher in pain VAS” or “clinically meaningful PHN (pain of 3 or higher in pain VAS).” Results: Although the initial pain VAS level of patients treated with STIPs (5.74) was higher than that of patients receiving ST (4.09), no significant difference in pain VAS number was seen between the 2 groups at 3 months (0.13 vs. 0.17) and 6 months (0.09 vs. 0.03) of follow-up.

염증성장질환 환자에서의 장관 외 피부 증상: 설문조사 연구 및 문헌 고찰,"Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. IBD tends to coincide with several cutaneous symptoms and signs; previous studies have suggested a link between IBD and immune-mediated skin diseases (ISDs) such as psoriasis, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis. However, there is a paucity of reports on extraintestinal cutaneous manifestations in patients with IBD from Asia and Korea.
Objective: We examined the prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in IBD patients and investigated the possible association between IBD and various dermatoses in a Korean tertiary care hospital.
Methods: Detailed questionnaires were administered to 120 patients diagnosed with IBD treated at the gastrointestinal center of our hospital. We also extracted their medical records retrospectively to obtain additional information about both their cutaneous manifestations and IBD, including disease duration and treatment course. A literature review on the prevalence of psoriasis in IBD patients was performed to clarify the association between those diseases.
Results: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis were noted in 58 and 62 cases, respectively. Reactive skin lesions including aphthous stomatitis, erythema nodosum, and pyoderma gangrenosum were found in 12 cases (10%). ISDs such as psoriasis, rosacea, and atopic dermatitis were present in 3.3%, 21.7%, and 12.5% of cases, respectively. Other dermatoses including herpes zoster, xerosis, and skin fungal infection were also detected.
Conclusion: The prevalence of cutaneous manifestations in IBD is similar to that reported previously in Asian patients.

주사 환자의 임상적 고찰 및 주사의 진단 분류 체계의 비교에 대한 연구,"Background: Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease, which primarily affects the central face. In 2002, the National Rosacea Society (NRS) committee developed the first diagnostic criteria for rosacea, based on its subtypes. The revised classification in 2017 prompted a proposal to transit from a subtyping to a phenotyping approach, reflecting current insights into rosacea pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and management.
Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the clinical features of rosacea and compare two diagnostic criteria in rosacea patients.
Methods: We performed a clinical study on 100 patients with rosacea diagnosed according to the 2002 NRS criteria. The age, sex, clinical features, subtypes, severity, and predisposing factors were evaluated using the questionnaire. In addition, we compared the 2002 and 2017 criteria, and evaluated patients if they met the revised criteria.
Results: According to the 2002 NRS classification, the erythematotelangiectatic type (88.0%) was the most frequent, followed by the papulopustular (43.0%), ocular (13.0%), and phymatous (6.0%) types. There were 44 overlapping cases, including 38 cases with 2 subtypes mixed and 6 cases with three subtypes. Six patients were diagnosed with rosacea using the 2002 NRS criteria but they did not satisfy the revised 2017 criteria.
Conclusion: We found that the diagnostic features of the 2002 criteria are too ambiguous for the diagnosis of rosacea. Therefore, we recommend that dermatologists recognize the necessity of a transition from a subtyping to a phenotyping approach, according to the 2017 criteria for the diagnosis of rosacea.

Conclusion: This study can be used as useful baseline data not only for the government to formulate a national health care plan but for each medical center to understand dermatologic disorders of the elderly and educate its staff members on the management of dermatologic problems of the elderly.
