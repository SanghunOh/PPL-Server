Methods: This study was a quasi-experimental study with a non-equivalent control group design.
Among 43 participants, 22 were assigned to the non-equivalent experimental group and 21 to the control group. The hospice palliative education program comprised 10 three-hour sessions, each given once a week. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, t-test and χ2-test using SPSS version 20.0. Results: Significant differences between the experimental and control groups were observed in their perception of hospice (t=6.63, P＜0.001), attitude towards death (t=2.36, P=0.023), and meaning of life (t=5.06, P＜0.001). Conclusion: The results indicate that this education program could positively affect the perception of hospice, attitude toward death, and meaning of life in adults. More studies are warranted to explore the effects of this education program for various age groups so that it may help more people get positive understanding of hospice palliative care. The results suggest this program could help improve the negative perception of hospice, negative attitude towards death and meaning of life that are generally held by the public.",최금희,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100669090
허혈성심장질환 진단에서 심장초음파의 국소벽운동이상과 심장효소의 정확성 평가,"Echocardiography and cardiac enzymes test are the tests to assess ischemic heart disease. The purpose of this study was to verify the accuracy by comparing and analyzing two tests for the diagnosis of ischemic heart disease. A retrospective study was conducted on 393 study subjects who underwent echocardiography and cardiac enzymes test. As a result of the study, regional wall motion abnormality (RWMA) increased as the age of the study subjects increased. As a result of ROC analysis, RWMA showed a larger area under the curve (AUC) than cardiac enzymes. RWMA showed the highest accuracy with 81.1% of all cardiac enzymes. Among cardiac enzymes, cTnI showed the highest accuracy. Thus, It was confirmed that RWMA of echocardiography is more accurate than cardiac enzyme is in diagnosing ischemic heart disease.",김희영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105152308
한국어판 McMaster Quality of Life Scale를 이용한 호스피스.완화의료 환자의 삶의 질,"Purpose: This study was to measure quality of life in hospice and palliative care patients. Methods: Research tools were the Korean version of McMaster quality of life scale and Spitzer's quality of life index used by 11 doctors in 7 institutes related to hospice and palliative care. Research subjects were 70 terminal cancer patients. Results: There was no statistically significant differences in the Korean version MQLS score by test-retest method. Cronbach's alpha was 0.90. The Pearson correlation coefficient for concurrent validity between the Korean version MQLS score and QLI score by physicians showed a moderate level of statistically significant correlation (r=0.55, P=0.002). The Korean version MQLS score of terminal cancer patients group in hospital ward of hospice was significantly higher than the others (F=4.958, P=0.004). Total scores of the Korean version MQLS ($Mean{\pm}SD=3.79{\pm}0.74$) and QLI ($Mean{\pm}SD=4.58{\pm}1.63$) showed moderate scores. Conclusion: The Korean version MQLS would be a reliable methods for the measurement of quality of life in Korean palliative care patients. The research tool would be satisfactorily used for assessment of hospice and palliative care patients during palliative phase.",김경운,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100669183
자궁경부암 근접치료 시 선량 검증 프로그램을 통한 임상적 위험성 평가,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical risk according to the applicator heterogeneity, mislocation, and tissue heterogeneity correction through a dose verification program during brachytherapy of cervical cancer. We performed image processing with MATLAB on images acquired with CT simulator. The source was modeled and stochiometric calibration and Monte-Carlo algorithm were applied based on dwell time and location to calculate the dose, and the secondary cancer risk was evaluated in the dose verification program. The result calculated by correcting for applicator and tissue heterogeneity showed a maximum dose of about 25% higher. In the bladder, the difference in excess absolute risk according to the heterogeneity correction was not significant. In the rectum, the difference in excess absolute risk was lower than that calculated by correcting applicator and tissue heterogeneity compared to the water-based calculation. In the femur, the water-based calculation result was the lowest, and the result calculated by correcting the applicator and tissue heterogeneity was 10% higher. A maximum of 14% dose difference occurred when the applicator mislocation was 20 mm in the Z-axis. In a future study, it is expected that a system that can independently verify the treatment plan can be developed by automating the interface between the treatment planning system and the dose verification program.",강동진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76462030
초음파로 진단된 자궁근종의 위험인자 평가,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the risk factors for uterine myoma diagnosed by ultrasonography in Korea women and to evaluate the risk. Among the patients who visited the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynecology at I hospital in Busin between January 2019 and March 2021 for the purpose of examination, 98 patients in the experimental group diagnosed with uterine myoma and 163 patients in the normal control group without other diseases were retrospectively conducted. Among the general characteristics of the subjects, age, body mass index, parity, and menopause showed significant differences between the myoma group and the normal control group. ROC(receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed to obtain the cut off value and odds ratio that can predict the occurrence of uterine myoma. The cut off value for the prediction of uterine myoma was determined to be 30 years old and a body mass index of 23 kg/m2. After that adjusting for menopause, non menopausal cases with a body mass index of 23 kg/m2 and over 39 years of age had the highest odds ratio of 6.04. Therefore, premenopausal women over 40 years of age require regular checkups and thorough weight management. This study was conducted with a small number of subjects. Therefore, there is a limit to generalizing to all Korean women. However, based on this study if a large scale prospective study considering various variables is made, it can play a role as a predictive marker in early detection of uterine myoma.",양성희(Yang Sung-Hee),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101890745
간호사를 위한 호스피스 연수교육 요구도 조사,"Purpose: This study aimed to assess the educational needs for nurses who care for terminal cancer patients and their families. To identify top needs along with key issues in consideration to develope hospice training program and provide specific recommendations. Methods: A cross-sectional design with nurses from nine universities' hospice specialist courses and seven cancer centers was used. Data were collected via e-mail or mail service from March to April in 2008. One hundred seventy three questionnaires were returned (return rate: 73.6%), and 156 questionnaires were eventually analyzed. The questionnaire consisted of Mason and Ellershaw's The Self-efficacy in Palliative Care (SEPC) and self-reporting confidence and educational needs in hospice care. Results: The mean age of the participants was 37.94 years, 82.1% were staff nurses, and 44.9% completed over six months hospice education. Mean$\pm$standard deviation score for total SEPC was $2.67{\pm}.62$, which was lower than average (score 3), with communication score being the lowest ($2.49{\pm}.69$). The lowest self-reporting confidence score was $2.03{\pm}.77$ in hospice administration and management, followed by providing complement therapy ($2.34{\pm}.77$), bereavement care ($2.34{\pm}.71$), lymph edema management ($2.35{\pm}.79$), and care planning ($2.36{\pm}.81$). The participants reported that additional education is needed in all topics, with pain management score being the highest ($3.71{\pm}.50$), followed by pain and symptom evaluation ($3.67{\pm}.52$), care for dying ($3.67{\pm}.52$), and communication and counseling ($3.63{\pm}.53$). There were significant subgroup differences in SEPC and self-reporting confidence between groups who completed 6 months hospice education or not, however, no significant difference in educational need between the groups. Conclusion: This study showed the need for developing hospice training program to improve compentency of nurses in hospice palliative care.",권소희,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100825813
