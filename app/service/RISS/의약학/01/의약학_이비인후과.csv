The purpose of this study was to analyze the voice and effectiveness of voice therapy in patients with functional voice disorders and to provide a guide for the treatment of functional voice disorder. Materials and Method : The records of 35 patients, presenting with functional voice disorder and receiving voice therapy during October, 2001 to September, 2002, were reviewed. Prior to voice therapy, the stroboscopic examination of their larynx, aerodynamic and acoustic analysis was done. The results of voice therapy were compared according to the patient's subjective, perceptual evaluation of voice, and maximal phonation time. Results : Patient's subjective, perceptual evaluation, and maximal phonation time showed superior results after voice therapy. Conclusion : The result of this study indicates that voice therapy is an effective treatment method of patients with functional voice disorder, especially muscular tension dysphonia.",정성민,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100683949
미세먼지가 알레르기비염에 미치는 영향과 기전,"Health impacts of particulate matter (PM) have become a global concern. PM tends to affectpatients with allergic diseases, such as allergic rhinitis (AR), more severely. Many epidemio-logical studies have shown that PM increases outpatient clinic visits as well as the prevalenceand severity of AR, while decreasing the quality of life of AR patients. However, the exactmechanisms underlying the effects of PM on the development and exacerbation of AR are stillpoorly understood. Various mechanisms are involved in the effects of PM on AR, includingimmunological response, oxidative stress, epithelial barrier dysfunction, allergic sensitization,and epigenetic modification.

자기 조절 개념을 적용한 음성치료 기법이 발성장애 환자에게 미치는 효과,"Background and Objectives：The goal of this study is to present a strategy for improving the self-regulation (SR) ability and facilitating the change of vocal behavior by applying voice therapy using the SR concept to the patients with vocal cord nodule and muscle tension dysphonia. Materials and Method：The subjects were 80 patients and 80 patients who were diagnosed with muscle tension dysphonia and vocal nodules. As a control group, the results were compared among patients with the same dysphonia without using SR strategies. The concept of SR before voice therapy was explained to the patients, and the treatment was divided into three stages according to the goal of voice therapy. The treatment stages consist of 1) skill acquisition, 2) habit formation, and 3) habit changes. voice therapy was performed by applying SR strategies such as goal implementation intentions and a less routine behavior. Patient’s dropout rates were measured to compare the adherence of voice therapy. Results： Significant improvement was seen in all groups receiving voice therapy. However, in the group using the SR strategy, the voice analysis results showed a relatively low dropout rate of voice therapy. In the generalization confirmation stage, patients who applied SR concept showed better results. SR strategy did no longer be necessary to maintain newly adopted vocal behavior.
Conclusion：The results of this study show that SR is one of the cognitive factors that can have a significant impact on the outcome of voice therapy, and also has a positive impact on the acquisition and generalization of new skills. A better understanding of SR and the development of therapeutic strategies using it will play an important role in solving voice problems in clinical settings.",이창윤,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101610712

빅데이터를 이용한 소아 중이염과 천식의 연관성 분석,"Background and Objectives Pediatric otitis media is closely related to upper respiratory illness and is one of the most common causes of hospital visiting and antibiotic prescription. Although there are many studies of asthma with other upper respiratory tract infections, few studies have investigated the relationship between asthma and otitis media. This study estimated whether pediatric otitis media is associated with the risk of asthma using the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC 2002-2013) data.
Subjects and Method In using the NHIS-NSC 2002-2013 data, children diagnosed as otitis media or bronchial asthma in 2002 were excluded from children from 1 to 8 years old in 2003. The patients who were diagnosed and treated as otitis media (n=8506) and the comparison group (n=65886) were enrolled in 2003. During a 10-year follow-up period until December 2013, the incidence of asthma between two groups was analyzed and the result was adjusted for the impact of comorbidities such as atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis with multivariate linear regression analyses.
Results In 2003, 20.88% of first-year-old children were treated with otitis media. The prevalence of otitis media was maintained at 15% until age 4 and decreased rapidly after 5 years of age. Asthma incidence was reported higher in patients with otitis media compared to the comparison group, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.196 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.127-1.269] followed by patients with atopic dermatitis [hazard ratio (HR) 1.261, 95% CI 1.196-1.33], allergic rhinitis (HR 1.473, 95% CI 1.409-1.54).
Conclusion Pediatric otitis media appeared to be associated with an increased risk of developing bronchial asthma after adjusting for other risk factors.

코로나바이러스감염증-19 환자의 구강증상과 병리학적 기전,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV-2) infection, is rapidly spreading worldwide. Oral manifestations of COVID-19, including sore throat, loss of taste, dry mouth, and ulceration have been widely reported. SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells using angiotensin- converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Therefore, high levels of expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may enhance SARS-CoV-2 invasion. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed in the taste bud and intermediate layer of the squamous epithelia of tongue papillae. Additionally, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were co-expressed in the ductal epithelium and acinar cells of salivary glands and in the neuronal cell body of trigeminal ganglia. SARS-CoV-2 directly invades the oral taste buds, causing loss of taste. Additionally, the possibility of neuroinvasion innervation of taste bud cells cannot be excluded. SARS-CoV-2 spreads around the suprabasal areas of the oral squamous epithelia, and invades the trigeminal nerve, resulting in oral manifestations. SARS-CoV-2 can directly invade the parotid and submandibular glands, as well as minor salivary glands, through the duct orifice.

갑상선안병증의 치료,"Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO) is an autoimmune disease associated with orbital inflammation and fibrosis which can result in lid retraction, soft tissue swelling, and proptosis. Treatment should rely on a thorough assessment of the activity and severity of GO. Control of risk factors for GO progression and topical treatments for dry eye are recommended for all patients. In mild GO, a careful observation is usually sufficient. In moderate-to-severe and active GO, high-dose intravenous glucocorticoids can be considered an initial treatment. The most common schedule for intravenous glucocorticoids is a cumulative dose of 4.5 g of methylprednisolone, divided into 12 weekly infusions (6 weekly infusions of 0.5 g, followed by 6 weekly infusions of 0.25 g). Orbital radiation has been shown to be an effective secondary treatment in patients with active GO unresponsive to intravenous glucocorticoids.

발성장애 환자에서 주관적 음성검사와 객관적 음성검사의 연관성 연구,"Background and Objectives Voice evaluation is classified into subjective tests such as auditory perception and self-measurement, and objective tests such as acoustic and aerodynamic analysis. When evaluating dysphonia, subjective and objective test results do not always match.
The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between subjective and objective evaluation in patients with dysphonia and to identify meaningful parameters by disease.
Materials and Method The total of 322 patients who visited voice clinic from May 2017 to May 2018 were included in this study. Laryngeal lesions were identified using stroboscopy. Pearson correlation test was performed to analyse correlation between subjective tests including GRBAS scale and voice handicap index, and objective tests including jitter, shimmer, noise to harmonic ratio (NHR), cepstral peak prominence (CPP), maximal phonation time (MPT), mean flow rate, and subglottic pressure.
Results In vocal nodule and sulcus vocalis, among GRBAS system, grade and breathiness showed good correlation with CPP, and roughness showed good correlation with jitter or shimmer. In unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP), grade and breathiness showed a very good correlation with CPP, and also good correlation with jitter, shimmer, NHR, and MPT. Also asthenia showed good correlation with CPP and MPT. Vocal polyp has a limited association with other diseases.

백색소음하 청성뇌간반응의 정상 결과의 분포,"Background and Objectives Recently, researchers have been interested in auditory brainstemresponse (ABR) under noisy condition for better diagnosis of the hidden hearing loss. However,there is no normative data conducted from a simple noise condition for the clinical settingyet. The purpose of the present study was to compare the data of ABR under quiet conditionwith those under noisy conditions and to confirm the feasibility of these data in the clinic.
Subjects and Method A total of 104 young listeners with normal hearing (53 female and 51male) participated. After completing the hearing screening tests, they were given the ABRmeasure with 75 dB nHL click stimulus under quiet condition, and with a level of 85 dB nHLwhite noise via a speaker. Absolute latencies and amplitudes of the waves were statisticallycompared against test condition and gender.
Results There was a significant difference of the latency and amplitude between the quietand noisy conditions. Under the noise, the absolute latencies of the waves I-V were delayed,and their amplitudes were smaller compared to the quiet condition. Such patterns were revealedin both female and male subjects. However, the females had shorter latencies and largeramplitudes than the male participants regardless of noise.
Conclusion We confirmed stable ABR data using simple white noise setting. In the followingstudy, patients with various pathologies should be applied for the ABR under noisy conditionand have their data standardized according to sensitivity and specificity.",김세아,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106834732

This study selected 28 papers published in Korea from 1998 to 2018 after searching the terms ‘Parkinson voice‘ and ‘Parkinson speech therapy.’ Literature review had been conducted in the two aspects of speech characteristics and speech therapy. The speech characteristics were divided into respiration, phonation, articulation, prosody, vowel production, and voice questionnaire. Speech therapy was divided into Lee Sliverman voice treatment (LSVT) and other voice therapy. PD patients did not differ in respiration function compared to normal elderly people, but their speech and articulation function were poorer. There was also a difference in the speech rate, frequency of pause, and accuracy of vowel production compared with normal elderly people. PD had a lower VHI score and their voice related quality of life was a little poorer. The LSVT was typically used in speech therapy for PD.

Here we aimed to evaluate the relationship be-tween subjective gustatory dysfunction and subjective or objective olfactory dysfunction ac-cording to cognitive function in geriatric patients.
Subjects and Method We prospectively enrolled patients who underwent both cognitivefunction test and olfactory function test between August 2018 and May 2019. The correlationbetween subjective gustatory dysfunction and subjective olfactory dysfunction or convention-al olfactory function scores was evaluated for geriatric patients with or withhout cognitivedysfunction. Participants with a threshold-discrimination-identification (TDI) score (<21) onthe YSK olfactory function test were diagnosed with olfactory dysfunction. Subjective gusta-tory function and olfactory function were evaluated using the visual analog scale. The Koreanversion of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Packetand Mini-Mental State Examination were administered to all participants. Overall, 120 pa-tients (27 male, 93 female; mean age, 73.00±7.50 years) were enrolled.
Results We found that the subjective gustatory function score did not correlate with thethreshold, discrimination, identification, or the summation of TDI scores of the olfactory func-tion test but was significantly associated with the subjective olfactory function score ( p<0.001).
Further, there was no significant correlation between the subjective gustatory function scoreand cognitive function.

"기능성 음성장애의 진단을 위한 음향학적, 청지각적 평가","Background and Objectives：The purpose of this study was to compare the measured values of acoustic and auditory perceptual assessments between normal and functional dysphonia (FD) groups. Materials and Methods：102 subjects with FD and 59 normal voice groups were participated in this study. Mid-vowel portion of the sustained vowel /a/ and two sentences of ‘Sanchaek’ were edited, concatenated, and analyzed by Praat script. And then auditory-perceptual (AP) rating was completed by three listeners. Results：The FD group showed higher acoustic voice quality index version 2.02 and version 3.01 (AVQIv2 and AVQIv3), slope, Hammarberg index (HAM), grade (G) and overall severity (OS), values than normal group. Additionally, smoothed cepstral peak prominence in Praat (PraatCPPS), tilt, low-to high spectral band energies (L/H ratio), long-term average spectrum (LTAS) in FD group were lower than normal voice group. And the correlation among measured values ranged from -0.250 to 0.960. In ROC curve analysis, cutoff values of AVQIv2, AVQIv3, PraatCPPS, slope, tilt, L/H ratio, HAM, and LTAS were 3.270, 2.013, 13.838, -22.286, -9.754, 369.043, 27.912, and 34.523, respectively, and the AUC of each analysis was over .890 in AVQIv2, AVQIv3, and PraatCPPS, over 0.731 in HAM, tilt, and slope, over 0.605 in LTAS and L/H ratio. Conclusions：In conclusion, AVQI and CPPS showed the highest predictive power for distinguishing between normal and FD groups.

2 cm 이하의 저위험군 갑상선유두암 환자에서 갑상선엽절제술과 갑상선전절제술의 비교연구,"Background and Objectives: The controversy over the optimal extent of thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) has persisted over a long time period. Particularly, there is a lack of consensus in low-risk PTC sized ＞1 cm and ≤2 cm. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the oncologic outcomes between hemi-thyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy in patients with low-risk PTC sized 2 cm or less. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of 1107 patients who were diagnosed as unilateral low-risk PTC with maximal tumor size 2 cm or less and initially underwent either hemi-thyroidectomy (n=550) or total thyroidectomy (n=557) was conducted. All patients underwent ipsilateral prophylactic central neck dissection. Patients had no evidence of gross extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastasis. Clinicopathologic factors and recurrence rate were compared according to the surgical extent and factors correlated to recurrence were analyzed. Results: While the total thyroidectomy group had more aggressive clinicopathologic factors such as minimal extrathyroidal extension, multifocality, and lymph node metastasis, recurrence rate was higher in the hemi-thyroidectomy group (p=0.006). However, when the contralateral lobe recurrence was excluded there was no difference in recurrence between the two groups (p=0.597). In patients with tumor sized ＞1 cm and ≤2 cm there was no significant difference in recurrence between the two groups (p=0.100). Conclusion: Total thyroidectomy may not decrease recurrence in patients with PTC presented with unilateral tumor sized ＞1 cm and ≤2 cm.

Prognostic Value of Hematological Markers in Head and Neck Cancer Patients With a History of Hematological Malignancy,"Background and Objectives Head and neck cancer can occur as a second primary tumorin patients with a history of hematological malignancy, and the pathological features of thoseare more aggressive than de novo primary head and neck cancer. However, research related tothe prognostic value of hematological markers in the head and neck cancer patients with a his-tory of hematological malignancy is scarce, so we performed this study.
Subjects and Method We reviewed a total of 89 head and neck cancer patients with hemato-logical malignancy diagnosed at a single tertiary hospital between 1997 and 2021, and enrolled29. The analyzed hematological parameters included pre- and post-treatment hemoglobin, he-matocrit, lactate dehydrogenase, absolute neturophil count (ANC), absolute platelet count, ab-solute leukocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio.
Results Hematological malignancy was diagnosed almost 62.14±96.10 months before headand neck cancer. The most common hematological malignancy was acute myeloid leukemia.
The overall survival (OS) rate was lower in patients with second primary tumor than in thosewith de novo primary head and neck cancer. The cox-proportional hazard ratio analysis showedthat the post-treatment absolute neutrophil count was significantly correlated with disease-freesurvival but not with OS.

박동성 이명의 진단과 치료의 최신 지견,"Pulsatile tinnitus (PT), in general, is not related to pathology of the auditory system. Although PT is not as common as non-pulsatile tinnitus, the diagnosis and treatment of PT is important as it is reported to be found in as much as 4% of general population and treatable vascular causes are found in 44~91% of subjects with PT. Three types of vascular origins (arterial, arteriovenous, and venous) of pulsatile tinnitus exist and the main causes of pulsatile tinnitus are related to aberrant/ectopic, stenosis, diverticulum, bony wall dehiscence, or other pathologies of blood vessels, either arterial or venous. Brain MRI with angiography, temporal bone high-resolution CT, Doppler ultrasonography, and classical transfemoral cerebral angiography are radiological diagnostic tools for pulsatile tinnitus, but basic findings at the outpatients’ clinic such as subjective psychoacoustic nature of the PT, otoendoscopic findings, and audiologic features are also very important as these can be of great help for the physicians to obtain presumptive diagnostic impression for each subject with PT. Dehiscence/diverticulum of the sigmoid sinus one of the most common surgically correctable venous cause of PT.

However, no conclusions that can be applied in the clinical field have yet been achieved. Most studies on pathological speech classification using speech have used the continuous short vowel /ah/, which is relatively easier than using continuous or running speech.

수면무호흡증 선별을 위한 STOP-Bang 설문과 스마트워치의 2단계 접근법,"Background and Objectives Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with varioushealth risks, including hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, diabetes,cognitive impairment, and all-cause mortality. While overnight polysomnography (PSG) isthe gold standard for diagnosing OSA, it is costly and time-consuming. The STOP-Bang ques-tionnaire is a convenient tool for OSA screening, but its high sensitivity comes at the expenseof low specificity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of combiningthe STOP-Bang questionnaire and a smartwatch capable of measuring oxygen saturation inscreening for OSA.
Subjects and Method Of the patients scheduled for PSG due to OSA, 109 patients volun-tarily participated in the study by filling out a STOP-Bang questionnaire during their first visitand wearing a smartwatch during PSG.
Results There were 80 males and 29 females, with the patients’ mean age of 45±13.3 years.
Based on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), 19 patients (17.4%) were normal, 28 (25.7%) hadmild OSA, 23 (21.1%) had moderate OSA, and 39 (35.8%) had severe OSA. When using theAHI threshold of AHI ≥15/h, the STOP-Bang alone showed sensitivity of 85.5% and specifici-ty of 61.7%. Combining the STOP-Bang questionnaire with a smartwatch resulted in a slightdecrease in sensitivity and a significant increase in specificity, yielding the values of 80.5%and 84.4%, respectively.

Therefore, the management of patients with thyroid cancer should be viewed from a long-term perspective, taking into account a return to normal social life. Cancer patients have a higher risk of unemployment than the general population, and so unemployment can be an economic problem for thyroid cancer patients. However, there have been few studies on factors affecting return to work in thyroid cancer patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate occupational changes and the period of leave of absence for patients with thyroid cancer and to identify factors that affect the return to work after surgery. Materials and Methods: A total of 427 questionnaires of thyroid cancer patients were used for the analysis. The occupational changes and sick leave periods were analyzed according to general characteristics, disease-related characteristics, and side effects. Results: The factors related to occupational change and leave of absence in thyroid cancer patients were sex and type of occupation. Women had more occupational changes and longer leave of absence than men, office workers had the least change in occupation, and professional workers had a longer period of sick leave.

두경부암에서 인유두종바이러스의 의미: 몇 가지 질문들,"The past decade has seen changes in the global trends for head and neck cancers in terms of incidence, etiologic and demographic patterns. Several case-control studies have consistently shown human papillomavirus (HPV) exposure dramatically increases the occurrence of oropharyngeal cancer. HPV related (+) oropharyngeal cancer has been found to be epidemiologically and clinically distinctive disease, characterized by younger age at onset, and strong association with reproductive behavior. The incidence of this disease is increasing sharply worldwide, whilst HPV negative (-) cancers are declining. HPV(+) cancers have significantly better survival and responses to chemoradiation, than HPV(-) counterparts. Given this superior survival, de-escalated therapies and organ preservation surgeries are being considered and on the clinical trial. Currently available prophylactic virus-like particle vaccines might be efficacious for primary prevention of HPV(+) cancers, although not validated yet. More researches are needed for the effective secondary prevention, through the deeper understanding of precancerous, molecular and pathologic changes.

만성 비부비동염 환자에서 부비동 내시경수술 후 비음도의 변화,"Background and Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) on nasalance in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).
Subjects and Method Eighty-one CRS patients were enrolled. The nasalance scores for oral, oro-nasal, and nasal passages were measured by nasometry and the nasal cavity volume was measured by acoustic rhinometry before and at 1 and 3 months after ESS. We divided the patients into four groups according to the following surgical interventions employed: unilateral anterior ethmoidectomy (group I), bilateral anterior ethmoidectomy (group II), bilateral total ethmoidectomy (group III), and bilateral pansinus surgery (group IV). We also divided the patients into three groups according to the CT scoring system and polyp grading system.
Results In group III and IV, the nasalance scores for all passages and nasal cavity volume were significantly increased after ESS but did not return to its preoperative level at 3 months after surgery. However, there were no significant changes in nasalance scores or in the nasal cavity volume in group I. Similarly, there were no significant changes in nasalance scores in the mild group (CT scoring system) or no polyp group, whereas the nasalance scores were significantly increased postoperatively in the moderate to severe groups (CT scoring system), and in groups that have nasal polyp group.
Conclusion The nasalance scores and nasal cavity volumes were increased after ESS and remained unchanged until postoperative 3 months. Postoperative changes in nasalance scores were more remarkable in patients who had more severe disease and who underwent more extensive surgery.

인공와우를 이용한 음악지각에 대한 고찰,"With a high sound quality stimulated by the electrical device and a large inclusion in medical insurance, the number of cochlear implant recipients has been rapidly increased in Korea. Today, it is not surprising that early implanted young children with congenital deafness show a similar performance to their normal hearing peers in speech perception. However, the cochlear implant users still have a trouble to enjoy music. This review study aims to introduce briefly about acoustic components that required to perceive the music and understand a relationship between cochlear implantation and temporal fine structure. For the pediatric implant users who have less experience on acoustical sound features but are much familiar with the electrically stimulated sound, perceiving the music seems to be challengeable due to the lack of temporal fine resolution related to pitch and timbre among various components of music. Four representative test batteries for evaluating the recipients’ ability of the music perception were mentioned and effective auditory music trainings were discussed with analysis of related investigations. Unlike hearing aids users who usually depend on fitting algorism for better music quality, the cochlear implant users need systematic training to improve their music perception ability. In conclusion, advancement of speech processing technology which can provide accurate information about the temporal fine structure of incoming music to the recipients needs to be developed. Also, a practical application of music training should be recommended as a part of auditory training for the cochlear implant users.",한우재,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101609791

COVID-19 유행 시 상기도 질환의 발생률: 전국 데이터 기반 역학 연구,"Background and Objectives Nonpharmacologic interventions (NPIs), such as social dis-tancing and preventive measures, were administered during the coronavirus disease (COV-ID-19) pandemic, which may influence the incidence of upper respiratory diseases (URDs).
The present study compared the incidence of URDs during the COVID-19 pandemic and dur-ing the years prior to COVID-19, and investigated the effect of NPIs on URD in the nation-wide general population.
Subjects and Method This is an epidemiologic study based on the Korean National HealthInsurance Database from March 2016 to February 2021. We compared the monthly incidenceof URDs from March 2020 to February 2021 (12 months) with that of the past four years. Anegative binomial regression model was used to evaluate the annual difference in the incidenceof each URD and adjusting temperature, humidity, and the level of particulate matter 10 (PM10).
Results The monthly incidence of ‘the five common URDs’ in 2020 was significantly lowerthan that in the past four years. The incidence of other chronic diseases, however, such as hy-pertension and diabetes mellitus, was comparable or higher in the past four years. Among thefive common URDs, influenza virus infections decreased most dramatically, nearing 99%,from 296.4-377.1 per 100000 people during the period of 2016 to 2019 to 3.7 per 100000 peo-ple in 2020.
Conclusion The present study shows that the incidence of ‘five common URDs’ significantlydecreased during the era of COVID-19 in Korea.

Long Term Average Spectrum을 이용한 성악가들의 Speaking Voice 분석,"Background and Objectives : Many studies have described and analyzed singer's formant and it has been shown that the epilaryngeal tube in the human airway is responsible for vocal ring, or the singer's formant. A similar phenomenon produced by trained singers in their speech led some authors to examine the speaker's ring. This study was designed to analyze the speaking voice of the singers and speaker's ring. Baterials and Methods : Ten tenors, fifteen baritones, fifteen sopranos and ten mezzo sopranos attending the music college, department of vocal music were chosen for this study. Fifteen male and fifteen female untrained normal speakers were chosen for control group. Each subject was asked to produce a sample of a sustained spoken vowel /ah/ sound for at least five seconds and read sentence 'Kaeul'. The sound data was analyzed using the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) - based power spectrum, Long term average(LTA) power spectrum using the FFT algorithm of the Computerized Speech Lab(CSL, Kay elemetrics, Model 4300B, USA). Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney test of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences(SPSS). Results : For LTA Power spectrum of/ah/ sound, a significant increase was seen in the 2,500-3,500Hz region(p<0.01) in four trained singer group compared with untrained speaker group, and a significant increase in the 9,000-10,000Hz region(p<0.01) in soparano group. Similarly, in sentence 'Kaeul', there was a significant increase in energy in the tenor, baritone, mezzo soprano group compared with the untrained speaker group in the 2,500-3,500Hz region(p<0.01), and a significant increase in all frequency region(p<0.01) in the soprano group. Conclusions : The LTA power spectrum suggests that trained singers group show more energy concentration in the 'singer's formant' region in the speaking voice, and authors believe this region to be the 'speaker's ring'. Further research is needed on the effect of singing training on the resonance of the speaking voice.",이경철,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430154
한국인의 음성질환이 삶의 질에 미치는 영향,"Background and Objectives : Quality of life(QOL) is a construct representing physical, mental and social well-being. QOL has been used as a device for measuring the severity of health-related condition and treatment outcomes. As the social welfare system develops, the attention to QOL increases as well. The aims of this study was to examine whether the patients with voice disorder perceived significantly more the effects of voice disorder on QOL than nonpatient group did and if any, identify the sociodemographic risk factors influencing QOL of patients. Materials and Methods : This study asked 113 adults with voice disorders who were enrolled in Voice Clinic in the Department of Otolaryngology, Kangbuk Samsung Hospital between lune 1998 and January 1999 and 111 nonpatients to complete a questionnaire designed to elicit information about the effete of voice disorders on quality of lift. The questionnaire included items concerning sociodemographic areas, voice symptoms, job, effects of voice disorders on QOL domains(work, social, psychological, physical, and communication areas), potential risk factors to exposures, familial and medical history of voice disorders. Results : The sociodemographic characteristics of the patient group are as follows : (1) 75.2% of total patient group were female and the rest were male. (2) Age of total patient group ranged from 20 to 65 years. Hoarseness was the most commonly reported complaints, followed by complaints of high note difficulties during singing and voice fatigue. The patient group perceived effects of voice disorders on the areas of work, social, psychological, physical and communication more adversely than the comparison group did (p＜0.05). QOL impairments were evaluated as a function of age, gender, education, and income, controlling other independent effects. The results were that (1) age was significantly associated with work problems and (2) gender and income were significantly associated with psychological problems. Conclusions : The findings indicated that the patients with voice disorders would perceive markedly adverse effect on all QOL domains, that is, work, social, psychological, physical, communicational areas. Therefore, the results of study suggest that lurker investigations about the nature of voice disorders, the prevention, treatment, and coping strategies are needed in the future.",송윤경,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106157952
급성 중추성 현훈,"Acute vertigo is a common symptom at the otolaryngology clinics or the Emergency Department. Also, many otolaryngologists see these patients first or they are referred from the Emergency Department. Although the stroke incidence in all dizzy patients is relatively low, the misdiagnosis of central vertigo may lead to serious morbidity and even mortality. Nevertheless, it is difficult to diagnose in vertigo patients whether the origin is central or not, especially at the initial visit. The purpose of this clinical review was to investigate clinical findings of acute central vertigo and to suggest the recent advance of differential diagnosis in these patients from peripheral vestibulopathy.

난청 분자유전진단의 현재 그리고 미래,"Advances in molecular biology and molecular genetic technologies have revealed extreme etiologic heterogeneity of genetic hearing loss. Genes known to contribute to deafness have been reported to be involved with a variety of function and structures in the cochlea of the inner ear. Genetic alteration in deafness genes manifests hearing loss either in syndromic or in nonsyndromic forms, albeit much more frequently in latter forms. Molecular genetic diagnosis in this nonsyndromic hearing loss is challenging in majority of cases. GJB2 is the most frequent etiology of severe to profound nonsyndromic hearing loss in most of the ethnic backgrounds. When no potentially pathogenic GJB2 mutation is detected, characteristic audiogram profiles and radiologic markers help us to select next candidate deafness genes. Mutations in SLC26A4 and POU3F4 causes enlarged vestibular aqueduct and incomplete partition type III anomaly, respectively. TECTA, TMPRSS3, WFS1, COCH, KCNQ4 and DIAPH1 give rise to a characteristic audiologic configuration, if mutated. This phenotype-driven candidate gene approach has been successful not infrequently. With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, molecular genetic diagnosis of hearing impaired subjects even without any characteristic markers is being widely tried. Targeted resequencing of known deafness genes appears to be effective in as high as 50-60% in making molecular genetic diagnosis at least for multiplex families where there are two or more affected hearing impaired subjects. Whole exome sequencing has been successful in revealing molecular genetic etiology anecdotally. More sophisticated pipeline and platform for revealing pathogenicity of detected variants both genetically and biologically is necessary to incorporate the advent of cutting edge sequencing technologies to the big step toward a personalized rehabilitation for hearing impaired subjects.

In addition, maternal thyroid hormone is essential for the formation and development of the fetal brain, nervous system, and bones. Therefore, when maternal thyroid hormone is insufficient, complications such as miscarriage, stillbirth, low birth weight and preeclampsia increase.
Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid dysfunction during pregnancy were established and published by the American Endocrine Society, the American Thyroid Association, and the European Thyroid Society. The Korean Thyroid Society also published recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease during pregnancy and postpartum in 2014. However, since the revised guidelines of the American Thyroid Association were published in 2017, many studies, including large-scale randomized controlled trials, have been published in relation to thyroid and pregnancy, and the need to revise the existing recommendations has emerged in Korea.

갑상선 질환의 방사성요오드 치료와 이차암 발생,"Radioiodine has been effectively applied for the management of hyperthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancers in most countries of the world. The majority of thyroid cancers are differentiated thyroid cancer that has an overall excellent prognosis, which attributed to appropriate treatment of the disease including administration of radioiodine, I-131. I-131 therapy has usually been undertaken for the ablation of remnant tissue or adjuvant treatment after surgical resection of the thyroid. I-131 therapy was routinely recommended for patients with high-risk disease, and should be considered for intermediate-risk disease as an adjuvant purpose. Several latest studies refute worries of increase cancer risk with I-131 treatment for thyroid cancer. Thus, recent ATA guidelines have shifted toward a more individual and stratified approach, because of benign nature of the differentiated thyroid cancer as well as awareness of side effects including potential increasing incidence of second primary malignancy after I-131 treatment. While some retrospective studies also pointed out that potential increases in cancer development after I-131 treatment for hyperthyroidism recently. Treatment decisions regarding the use of radioiodine therapy should consider the balance of risks and benefits for individual patients with low risk differentiated thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism, if it is true.

However, a small fraction of these nodules can be cancerous, and even benign nodules can cause symptoms if they grow and compress surrounding tissue. As such, it is important to monitor thyroid nodules and determine appropriate treatment options. In recent years, there has been a shift towards enhancing diagnostic accuracy and less aggressive treatment options. As a result, there is a growing need for the development of appropriate recommendations for their clinical application to ensure optimal patient outcomes. The present clinical practice guideline was developed by extracting the nodule section from the prior version of guidelines and updating it to fit the Korean circumstances. Task force members reviewed relevant studies selected after electronic database searching, and the recommendations are provided with a level of recommendation for each section. The revised guideline includes recommendations for thyroid cancer screening in high-risk groups, appropriate diagnostic methods for thyroid nodules, the role of pathological and molecular marker tests in diagnosis, long-term follow-up and treatment of benign thyroid nodules, and special considerations for pregnant women. The major changes in this revision are the definition of high-risk groups for thyroid cancer screening, the application of the revised Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS), the addition of the role of core needle biopsy and molecular marker tests, the application of active surveillance in low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, and updated indications for non-surgical treatment of benign thyroid nodules.

Aro-eases, is becoming more comonly acepted within the health service. However, there are very few published articles, which provide a sound rationale for the use of aromatherapy as a medical intervention. The purpose of this study was to find a scientific explanation for the effect of aromatherapy by investigating 1) whether or not essential aroma oils caused increased brain activity and 2) which areas of the brain were activated by the essential aroma oils. Materials and Method：Olfactory fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging)performed on 11 healthy adult humans during exposure to esential aroma oils (lavender and lemon oils) and buthanol. The c-fos immunohistochemical staining was also performed on brain tisues of 24 Mongolian gerbils after exposure to the esential aroma oils. Results：In the human fMRI study, the olfactory cortex was activated in all subjects by the essential aroma oils and butha-nol. Aditionally, lavender oil also activated the hearing and language-related regions of brain. In the animal study, similar results were observed：exposed to lavender oil.

전문 음성사용인들의 성대결절에 있어 성대 내 스테로이드 주입술 이후 음성치료의 유용성,"Background and Objectives A local steroid injected directly into the vocal nodules has recently come to the forefront as another treatment option, which is reported as useful and effective. However, vocal nodules are caused mainly by excessive voice use, and therefore, even if a marked improvement was shown after injection, recurrence can occur unless the voice abuse habit is changed. We hypothesized that voice therapy after steroid injection would reduce recurrence of vocal nodules in professional voice users.
Subjects and Method This prospective study included thirty female professional voice users with vocal nodules treated with vocal cord steroid injection on between May 2010 and March 2011. The experimental group (n=15) received the voice therapy after vocal cord steroid injection, and the control group (n=15) received only vocal cord steroid injection. Videostroboscopy, acoustic voice analysis, and Voice Handicap Index (VHI) were evaluated prior to the steroid injection and 4 and 8 weeks after steroid injection.
Results Jitter, shimmer, noise-to-harmonics ratio, and mean VHI improved significantly after steroid injection in both group (p＜0.05). There was no significant complication and voice discomfort after steroid injection in both groups. And, there were no significant differences in all parameters between the two groups. However, the experimental group (13.3%) showed less recurrence rate of vocal nodules than the control group (53.3%) after 8 weeks.
Conclusion Vocal cord steroid injection was useful treatment option of vocal nodules in professional voice users. And voice therapy after steroid injection would be effective in preventing a recurrence of vocal nodules than only steroid injection.

"훈민정음 음성학(II): 초성, 종성(닿소리) 제자해에 대한 음성언어의학적 고찰","Hunminjeongeum had 17 initial consonant letters. Among them, five consonant letters, those are ㄱ (牙音, molar sound letter), ㄴ (舌音, lingual sound letter), ㅁ(脣音, labial sound letter), ㅅ (齒音, dental sound letter), ㅇ (喉音, guttural sound letter), were served as chief consonants. There was no argument that consonant letters were made by symbolizing the shape of vocal organs during phonation of them. It could be phoniatrically explained that all of five chief consonants were morphologically symbolized from left lateral view of vocal tract during articulation. Although ‘ㄱ’ was known as molar sound, it was not modeled the shape of molar tooth but modeled the shape of tongue at molar teeth bearing area. The same principle applies to ‘ㅅ’, and it was represented the shape of upper surface of anterior tongue instead of incisor teeth. ‘ㄴ’ was a lingual sound and directly shaped the shape of tongue. ‘ㄷ’ was made by addition of a stroke ‘ㅡ’ meaning hard palate above ‘ㄴ’. ‘ㅁ’ was represented the shape of lateral view of anterior mouth. ‘ㅇ’ was looked like shaping left lateral view of laryngopharyngeal space.",최홍식,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100683792
갑상선 절제 술 후 기능적 음성장애의 공기역학적 특징과 음성치료 중재,"Background and Objectives:The objective of this study was to investigate the features of post-thyroidectomy subjective voice disorder by Voice Handicap Index (VHI) and Voice Symptom Scale (VOISS) through aerodynamic analysis and to investigate the appropriate voice therapy intervention. Materials and Methods:Twenty post-thyroidectomy patients who had no recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis through laryngeal stroboscopy were enrolled for this study. Acoustic and aerodynamic evaluations were performed before operation, 2 weeks and 3 months after operation. Subjective voice evaluation was performed by VHI and VOISS. Aerodynamic evaluation was compared and analysed by maximum phonation time(MPT), phonation threshold pressure(PTP), mean air flow rate(MFR), etc. Subjective voice evaluation was surveyed through VHI and VOISS. To evaluate patients' symptoms related to functional voice disorder, scores on physical domain in VHI and VOISS were selected to be compared for each session. Results: The 10 out of 20 participants who complained of voice symptoms had no significant difference with pre-operation in acoustic evaluation, but all showed higher scores on 2 weeks and 3 months after operation compared to pre-operation, in VHI-physical domain and selected questionnaires in VOISS. They reduced MPT and increased PTP value simultaneously. Laryngeal massage and breathing training were simultaneously treated to them, 5 participants resulting in improvement in MPT and PTP compared to pre-treatment. Conclusion:Patients who complained voice change with no organic damage after thyroidectomy were all shown to have reduced MPT and increased PTP in some by aerodynamic evaluations. Reduced MPT may imply some problem in air flow beneath glottis. Increased PTP suggests much more effort in vocalization mechanism than pre-operation. Comparing aerodynamic evaluations in post-thyroidectomy may provide information on behavioral interventions. Additionally, study on laryngeal massage and breathing training simultaneously treated to patients with such voice disorder is needed to be conducted with larger number of participants.",이창윤,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100683781

최장발성폐기능저하를 동반한 일측성 성대마비 환자에서의 S/Z Ratio와 최장 발성시간(Maximum Phonation Time)의 유용성 비교,"Background and Objectives : MPT is directly related to degree of glottal closure. So it is widely used in the assessment of glottal closure with unilateral vocal fold paralysis. But MPT could be influenced not only by glottal closure but also by pulmonary function. So MPT might not reflect glottal closure in UVFP with decreased pulmonary function. The purpose of the study is to evaluate usefulness of MPT and ratio of /s/ time to /z/ time before and after injection laryngoplasty in UVCP with decreased pulmonary function. Materials and Methods : This study involved 34 patients with unilateral vocal fold paralysis : with decreased pulmonary function in group A (n=15) : with normal pulmonary function in group B (n=19). All patients underwent injection laryngoplasty. Paramters of perceptual analysis, acoustic analysis, aerodynamic analysis, videostroboscopy were compared between two groups. Results : Breathness and asthenic scale, G scale of perceptual analysis were significantly improved in both groups. Glottal gap index were significantly decreased after injection in both groups. In aerodynamic analysis, MPT was improved after injection laryngoplasty in both groups, but S/Z ratio was improved only in group B. In correlation analysis, /s/ time was not correlated with pulmonary function. Conclusion : S/Z ratio reflects neither the pulmonary function nor the glottal clousure properly. MPT is more useful indicator than S/Z ratio to evaluate vocal fold paralysis even with decreased pulmonary function.",박준표,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100683805
갑상선 수술 후 발생한 음성장애에 대한 음성치료 역할,"Voice therapy after post-thyroidectomy dysphonia is designed to improve glottal closure without supraglottic hyperfunction by development of abdominal support for breathing and intrinsic muscle strengthening exercises. Regarding voice therapy of unilateral vocal fold paresis/paralysis, several techniques such as head positioning, digital manipulation, pushing and pulling method are used for trial or temporary therapy. And the holistic voice therapy such as LSVT, Accent method, VFE are useful for hypofunctional voice disorders. These may be effective interventions as a temporary improvement until normal voice recovers or may provide the essentials for long-term rehabilitation.",윤영선,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108114370
보톡스 주입술로 치료된 윤상인두 연하장애 1예,"Hyperfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) can cause severe dysphagia. This condition referred as cricopharyngeal dysphagia may occur after head and neck surgery due to altered muscle spasm and stenosis of the pharyngo-esophageal segment. Among various treatment options available, Botulinum toxin A (Botox) injection offers a nonsurgical treatment which is useful especially for debilitated patients, and there has been a recent increase in the clinical use of Botox by otolaryngologists for managing such conditions. A 55-year-old male with base of tongue (BOT) cancer suffered from severe dysphagia after total glossectomy and neck dissection treatment. Videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) showed inability to pass food through the UES due to cricopharyngeal spasm. After injection of 10 U of Bot ox into each cricopharyngeus muscles (total 20 U) via EMG-guided percutaneous injection, swallowing function had improved and oral nutrition was possible, with food passing through the UES visualized on VFSS and FEES.",최규영,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108249089
구강 작열감 증후군의 약물적 치료 비교 연구,"Background and Objectives Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) refers to a collection of symptoms of patients who complain about burning sensation of their mouths without any specific causes. Although this is not a rare disease, the etiology and effective treatment are not well established. We tried to compare the efficacy and side effects of the agents that are reported to be relatively effective to BMS.
Subjects and Method Fifty-one patients who were diagnosed as BMS were chosen as candidates. Trazodone, Paroxetine, Clonazepam, and Gabapentin, which were known to be effective medicines for BMS in previous research were prescribed randomly. We prescribed medication for two weeks and evaluated patients for the effect and side effects at the end of the treat-ment. The medication was prescribed for 2 more weeks and the patients were evaluated again.
Results Three of 11 (27.3%) patients were prescribed Trazodone, 8 of 12 (66.7%) Paroxetine, 8 of 14 (57.1%) Clonazepam and 12 of 14 (85.7%) Gabapentin. Q showed improvements after 4 weeks of medication. The differential effectiveness among the medications was not significant, except for the inferiority of Trazodone. Five of 11 (45.5%) patients who had been prescribed Trazodone, 2 of 12 (16.7%) who had been prescribed Paroxetine, 2 of 14 (14.3%) who had been prescribed Clonazepam, 2 of 14 (14.3%) who had been prescribed Gabapentin complained of side effects during 4 weeks of medication.
Conclusion We can expect high success rates of treatment for burning mouth syndrome with Paroxetine, Clonazepam and Gabapentin. A further study for long term outcomes and side effects in large groups is warranted.",최효근,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108249096
Rat Model의 노화에 따른 성대에서 나타나는 조직학적 변화,"Background and Objectives Aging causes atrophy in mucosa of vocal folds, resulting in various deleterious changes in phonation. Eventually, these changes impair an elderly individual’s ability to communicate with others and affect their quality of life. This investigation was carried out to determine the morphological characteristics of vocal folds in two different aged groups of rats, and to perform a validation of a rat model of age-related changes in larynx.
Subjects and Method Larynges were obtained from 12 rats, of which 6 rats were 6 months old and the others 18 months old. The middle portion of each vocal folds were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson’s trichrome (MT), Alcian blue (AB) and compared.
Results Extracellular matrix in lamina propria of vocal folds presented lower density in 18 months-old rats than in 6 months-old rats (p＜0.05). Also more severe fibrosis was observed in 18 months-old rats than in 6 months-old rats (p＜0.05). Six months-old rats showed higer concentration of hyaluronic acid than did 18 months-old rats (p＜0.05).
Conclusion Aged vocal folds showed increased fibrosis and decreased density of collagen and hyaluronic acids in the lamina propria compared to young vocal fold.",임동욱,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108249092
