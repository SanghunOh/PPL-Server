감각통합치료가 감각조절장애 아동의 놀이에 미치는 효과,"Objective : This study is to verify effect of a sensory integration (SI) intervention on sensory processing of children with sensory modulation disorder (SMD), and to explore how the SI intervention affect play, socialization, occupational performance and occupational satisfaction of those children.
Method : Five children with developmental disabilities living in metropolitan were diagnosed as SMD by the Sensory History Interview (SHI) and Short Sensory Profile (SSP). The SMD children undergone the 48 sessions of 50 min intervention twice in a week for six months and took the Revised Knox Preschool Play Scale(RKPPS), Social maturity test, Canadian Occupational Performance Measure(COPM), and Japanese Sensory Inventory Revised(JSI-2) before- and after the intervention. The result data analyzed by the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test.
Results : All data of post-intervention differed significantly; RKPPS(Z=-2.023, p=.043), Social maturity test(Z=-2.023, p=.043); occupational performance(Z=-2.023, p=.043); satisfaction(Z=-2.032, p=.042); and tactile system of JSI-2(Z=-2.032, p=.042).
Conclusions : The results advocate that sensory integration intervention is effective in improving tactile processing, play, socialization, occupational performance, and occupational satisfaction of child with SMD. It is found that sensory integration intervention improves not only one’s occupational performance but also underlying components of the performance. In order to generalize this conclusion, further studies need to be done with more number of subjects and consideration of environmental factors. Striving for more reliable and valid methods of data collection is also suggested.",김진미,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3080326

대상포진에 대한 임상적 연구: 대상포진에서 나타나는 가려움증의 임상적 특징을 중심으로,"Background: Herpes zoster is a common dermatologic disorder. However, there have been no reported studies of the characteristics of pruritus in herpes zoster in Korean literature. Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the epidemiological features and clinical characteristics of pruritus in herpes zoster. Methods: Retrospective study was performed by reviewing the medical records of 178 patients with herpes zoster. The analyses of age, gender, accompanying symptoms, dermatomal distribution, underlying disease, treatment and complication were performed. Results: The ratio of male to female patients was 2：3. The age distribution ranged from 1 to 87 years old. A total of 76.4% of the patients with herpes zoster experienced pruritus, and 18.4% of the patient with pruritus had pruritus that disrupted normal activities. There were no relationships between the incidence of pruritus and age of patients, gender, dermatomal distribution, and incidence of pain. As the severity of pain increased, the incidence and the severity of pruritus increased (p=0.01, p=0.01). Pruritus was improved within 3 weeks in the 74.3% of the patients with pruritus; however, 9.6% of the patients felt complaint with pruritus over 6 weeks. The duration of the pruritus extended with advancing age (p=0.01). As the severity of pruritus and pain increased, the duration of pruritus increased (p=0.025). Conclusion: Pruritus is a common symptom in herpes zoster, and this study describes the general aspects of pruritus in herpes zoster. Advancing age and the severity of the pruritus and the pain are possible risk factors of long-lasting pruritus.

그룹감각통합치료가 아동의 놀이와 또래 상호작용에 미치는 영향,"Objective : The purpose of the study is to find out how group sensory integrative (SI) intervention enhances play skill and social interaction of the children with sensory integration disorders.
Method : Three children who were showing problems related in sensory integration received 12 SI intervention sessions. The Sensory Profile (SP) and The Social Maturity Scale (SMS) were accomplished by the subject’s primary caregiver. Test of Playfulness (ToP) and Peer Social Interactions Rating Scale (PSIRS) were utilized to investigate the children’s play skills and social interactions with their friends. Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) is applied to assess the children’s play skill, social interactions with peer, and sensory processing at each session. Data was collected before- and after the intervention and analyzed by the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test with SPSS/WIN version 10.0 and Microsoft Excel.
Results : The average scores of ToP, PSIRS, and SMS were increased after the sensory integrative intervention. However, there is no significant difference in the play skills and social interactions between data of pre-intervention and the one of post-intervention. The score of the GAS was frequently increased in terms of the play skills and sensory processing throughout the whole sessions.
Conclusions : This study reveals a possibility of that the group sensory integrative intervention may affect not only sensory processing ability, but also play skills and social interactions of children experiencing difficulties of sensory processing. Future research should supplement limitations of this study regarding insufficient number of the subject and the short period of the experiment.",홍은경,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82712640

성인성 호흡부전증(ARDS)의 호흡역학 개선을 위한 실험연구,"The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a disorder of diffuse lung injury secondary to a wide variety of clinical insults including sepsis. It is manifested by impaired oxygenation, pulmonary edema, decreased static and dynamic compliance of lung, and increased airway resistance. Reduced lung compliance together with increased airway resistance is a hallmark of the syndrome and has generally been considered as the primary abnormality of lung mechanics. The study was designed to reproduce an ARDS condition in an animal model with acute lung injury and to determine whether these changes are reversed by inhalation of aerosolized bronchodilator such as salbutamol or nicorandil. Six adult mongrel dogs were exposed to intravenous oleic acid (0.08 ml/kg) mixed into a same amount of pure enthanol. We defined a condition of PaO2 less than 60 mmHg in FiO2 0.6 as an acute diffuse lung injury. Lung mechanics were deteriorated after oleic acid injection, from 27.33±2.73 to 17.50±7.47 cmH2O/1/sec in compliance and from 14.55±4.46 to 26.33±6.02 ml/cmH2O in airway resistance. Salbutamol or Nicorandil inhalation significantly improved lung compliance to 30.67±11.30 or 36.33±9.00 cmH2O/1/sec and airway resistance to 16.77±7.47 or 19.55±5.45 ml/cmH2O. From above data, we carefully concluded that compromized lung mechanics in adult respiratory distress syndrome could be effectively managed by inhalation of aerolized bronchodilator.",백광제,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82650711
인유두종바이러스 관련 질환의 예방을 위한 남성 대상 백신의 임상적 유용성,"HHPV (Human Papillomavirus) is a DNA virus that can cause benign lesions, genitourinary cancer, and oropharyngeal cancer by penetrating the mucous membrane and skin. It is widely known to be transmitted mainly through sexual contact. As with many viral infections, vaccines have been developed to prevent infection with HPV. Currently, in many countries, HPV vaccines are mainly used for national immunization for women to prevent diseases that traditionally occur frequently in women, especially cervical cancer. However, since the vaccination rate is relatively low, many countries are struggling with ways to increase the vaccination rate. Meanwhile, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer caused by HPV in men has been increasing recently. In the United States, the annual number of oropharyngeal cancers in men already exceeds the number of cervical cancers in women, so HPV infection in men has emerged as a major problem. Accordingly, interest in HPV vaccination in men has also increased, and studies on the effectiveness and necessity of vaccination of both women and men compared to women alone are being actively conducted. In this paper, the evidence of HPV vaccination for men will be reviewed through previous studies, and its validity and cost-effectiveness will be analyzed to bolster the clinical usefulness of HPV vaccination for men.",이세영(Sei Young Lee),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103021735
감각통합기능장애를 가진 청소년의 작업수행에 초점을 맞춘 작업치료 사례,"Introduction : Sensory Integration(SI) theory, science it is developed by an occupational therapist A. Jean Ayres, is the one of the most popular frames of reference used in occupational therapy(OT) intervention. It has been proved as a scientific theory especially in neuroscience discipline through abundant research and practice. Occupational therapists apply the SI therapy with strong clinical reasoning to improve adaptive behaviors of their clients and try to link the adaptive behaviors with occupational performance in the clients’ everyday life. One of the manners regarding clinical reasoning is Top-down approach. In occupational therapy discipline, Top-down approach is well-reflected within two evaluation tools; Canadian Occupational Performance Measure(COPM) and Assessment of Motor and Process Skills(AMPS) and two models of practice; Canadian Model of Occupational Performance(CMOP) and Occupational therapy intervention process model(OTIPM).
Objective : The purpose of this paper demonstrates how SI therapy can be employed within OTIPM and how the OT process (evaluation-intervention-outcome) can be structuralized based on the Top-down approach. This single-case study recognizes the impact of a SI therapy for a male adolescent on his occupational performance.
Intervention Examined : “P” was 16 years old male adolescent with no diagnosis and junior of the high school when he was referred. P was always with mouth opened, showed difficulties in gathering things need to be prepared and managing and paying money for shopping, and his colleges dislike getting close to him because he can’t was his body well. AMPS was administrated in initial evaluation and reevaluation of P’s occupation performance, Bruininks-Oserestky Test of Motor Proficiency-2(BOT-2) was carried out to assess motor functions and perception skills related in sensory integration, and occupational therapist performed clinical observation in order to complement the evaluation quantitatively and quantitatively. Based on the evaluation, it is concluded that the SI therapy is primary means to improve P’s occupational performance, and three therapeutic approaches were constructed; restorative, acquired and compensatory approach. P showed improved motor and process skills in occupational performance after undergone the occupational therapy.
Conclusions : The sensory integration therapy was practical enough to build the bridge between the occupational performance(Top) and the underlying component problems (Bottom). The OTIPM was helpful to identify meaningful occupation for P and P’s family within P’s contexts, and the AMPS was valuable to analyze and clarify the cause of difficulties in the chosen occupational performance.","지석연 (Ji, Seok-Yeon)",2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40025653

여드름 환자에서 휴대용 디지털 피부형광 진단기기의 임상적 유용성에 관한 연구,"Background: Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) is a gram positive anaerobic bacteria which plays a key role in the development of acne. Therefore, culture of P. acnes from the acne lesion can serve as an important clinical tool for selecting antibiotics and judging the therapeutic response. However the conventional cultural method is not easy to perform in clinical settings. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical application of portable digital skin fluorescence imaging equipment in patients with acne. Methods: Total of 60 objects (33 males and 27 females) with facial acne were recruited. To estimate fluorescence color and size according to the acne lesion, digital fluorescence images were taken and analyzed with image analysis program. Also, we examined the species and the quantification of bacteria aerobically and anaerobically isolated from each kind of acne lesion. Results: Among the bacteria cultured, coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) was the most common (57.7%), followed by P. acnes (46.1%). Noninflammatory lesions (comedones) showed statistically significant correlation with red fluorescence and inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) with green fluorescence (p=0.004). The density of CNS and P. acnes were also significantly associated with fluorescence size (p=0.014, p=0.005). However, there was no statistical association between the strains of bacteria and the color of fluorescence (p=0.192). Conclusion: Since the size of fluorescence correlates well with P. acnes levels, we found the noninvasive technique of portable digital skin fluorescence imaging equipment to be useful in choosing adequate antibiotics and monitoring antibiotic therapy in acne vulgaris.
