Many accelerated rehabilitation programs have been introduced in order to restore the knee joint function, and performed pre-and post-operatively. Pre-operative rehabilitation programs consistof preparing the operation mentally and physically, especially the patient education is the most important point of this step. Post-operative rehabilitations and methods of the ligament reconstruction should be explained and expectation of the patients also should be fully understood by the surgeon. The main purpose of rehabilitation is to acquire contentable range of motion by regulating painand swelling of the knee joint, and to prevent atrophy of quadriceps muscles. The fundamental concepts of the post-operative rehabilitation are early knee joint extension, early weight bearing and early recover of quadriceps muscle power of the knee joint. Passive knee extension should be achieved completely within 1 week post-operatively to prevent contracture of the posterior capsule and scaring of the femoral condylar notch, but if not attained at least 2 weeks, that could bring a poor outcomes. Partial weight bearing should be started immediately if not painful, and full weight bearing could be allowed after 4 weeks. Quadriceps muscle exercise including isometric contracture should begin to start at the first day after surgery because restoration of quadriceps muscle power is important for return to activity of daily living. Electrical muscle stimulation and biofeedback would be helpful to recover quadriceps muscle power by decreasing pain and swelling of the joint effectively. Two weeks after surgery, patients could begin closed kinetic chain exercise, after that, patients could exercise the quadriceps muscle more effectively adding open kinetic chain exercise. Recently, trainings for proprioception and neuromuscular control have been emphasized in orderto improve dynamic stability of the knee joint. Nowadays, variable post-operative rehabilitation programs are introduced for regain the knee joint function, and can be differed by types of graft, concomitant injuries, and especially methods of surgery, so should be performed individually, not by standardized program.",이한준 ( Han Jun Lee ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106573807
만성 외측 발목 불안정증의 수술적 치료,"Surgical treatments for chronic lateral ankle instability include anatomic repair, anatomic reconstruction using an auto or allograft, non-anatomic reconstruction, and arthroscopic repair. Open anatomic repair using the native ligament with or without reinforcement of the inferior extensor retinaculum is commonly performed in patients with sufficient ligament quality. Non-anatomical reconstruction using the adjacent peroneus brevis tendon is typically used only in patients with poor-quality ligament remnants or when previous repair failed. Anatomical reconstruction can be considered in patients in whom anatomical repair is expected to fail and when performed using auto or allografts can provide good to excellent short-term results, although the long-term outcomes of these methods remain unclear. Arthroscopic repair can provide good to excellent short-term clinical outcomes, but evidence supporting this technique is limited. The advantages and disadvantages of various surgical methods should be compared, and appropriate treatment should be implemented based on patient characteristics.",양기원,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108013516
아킬레스건 파열 치료에 대한 최신 지견,"Achilles tendon rupture is a common sports injury encountered in younger populations. Various treatment methods are used for acute and chronic rupture. Several treatments for each condition are available, each having their advantages and disadvantages. In an acute rupture, surgical treatment may be a priority for younger patients or those wishing a quick return to play, but the long-term functional outcome is similar to non-surgical treatment. In addition, the re-rupture rate shows a slight difference between the two treatments. The clinical outcomes are similar regardless of the surgical treatment, but an accelerated rehabilitation program should be accompanied by good results. In chronic and neglected rupture, surgical treatment is preferred over non-surgical treatment. Treatments are chosen based on the size of the tendon defect.

The overuse injuries are generally multifactorial in origin and are caused by repetitive strain of the affected tendon till the tendon can no longer endure the tensile stress. Various alignment and biomechanical faults are claimed to play a causative role. Only 2% of patients complaining of Achilles tendon pain are caused by systemic disease. However, to ensure the right approach to treatment, it is necessary to rule out inflammatory tendinitis caused by systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and seronegative spondyloarthrosis.",김대유,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108011143
외상 환자의 수액 치료,"Fluid therapy is one of the fundamental treatments for the management of trauma patients. Apart from supplementary hydration, fluid therapy is also applied for resuscitation. Especially in cases of hypovolemic shock due to bleeding, fluid therapy needs to be carefully adjusted to correct the shock. The importance of fluid therapy is increasing not only in resuscitation and treatment after hospitalization but also in pre-hospital care. Fluid therapy needs to be adjusted based depending each patient’s volume status. The various classifications of fluids include crystalloid solutions, glucose solutions, and colloid solutions. Although not included as a fluid therapy, blood transfusion is increasingly gaining more importance than fluid therapy in unstable trauma patients. Early appropriate fluid therapy is crucial in the treatment of hemodynamically unstable patients such as multiple trauma and massive bleeding, whereas comprehensive fluid therapy should be applied by considering the characteristics of specific injuries such as fractures, vascular damage, and cerebral hemorrhage, as well as the age groups (children, the elderly, and pregnant women).",허요,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82591263
"압궤증후군: 외상성 횡문근융해증, 재관류 손상","A crush injury causes damage to bones, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, and other tissues caused due to pressure. Crush syndrome is a reperfusion injury that occurs throughout the body after a crush injury and leads to traumatic rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle fibers are broken down. Owing to the decreased blood supply, inflammation, and changes in metabolic activity, fluids and electrolytes in the blood can move into tissues, causing hypovolemic shock. In addition, toxic substances resulting from cell destruction can circulate through the bloodstream, causing electrolyte imbalances, renal failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, with approximately 15% of patients with acute renal failure dying. The treatment for crush syndrome involves aggressive fluid therapy and correction of the electrolyte imbalances, while patients with acute renal failure may require dialysis. Surgical treatment may include debridement and irrigation of necrotic tissue, and fasciotomy is necessary to address compartment syndrome, a complication that may arise.",윤용철,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82648642
골절의 합병증: 급성 구획증후군,"Acute compartment syndrome occurs when the pressure in the closed bone-myofascial muscle compartment rises above a critical level, and venous perfusion through the capillaries is blocked, resulting in microcirculation disorders. Tissue ischemia in the compartment causes irreversible damage to the muscles, nerves, and even bones, and can cause functional disorders, muscle contractures, nerve damage, and nonunion. In addition to trauma, phlebitis after injection, pseudoaneurysm due to blood vessel damage, anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), and exercise are all known causes of acute compartment syndrome. On the other hand, it commonly occurs after a fracture, leading to serious complications if not treated appropriately.

Two theories are proposed for the manifestation of FES: in the mechanical theory, FES occurs when fat tissue in the bone marrow enters the bloodstream and mechanically blocks it; the biochemical theory proposes that FES occurs due to an inflammatory reaction caused by free fatty acids. There are currently no clear diagnostic criteria for FES, and symptoms and signs are typically nonspecific. For the treatment of FES, conservative and supportive management is performed for the specific symptoms, and close monitoring of the respiratory and neurologic systems is required in high-risk groups.

골관절염에서 줄기세포를 이용한 연골 재생의 최신 지견,"Osteoarthritis is a disease characterized by the progression of articular cartilage erosion, that increases pain during joint motion and reduces the ability to withstand mechanical stress, which in turn limits joint mobility and function. Damage to articular cartilage due to trauma or degenerative injury is considered a major cause of arthritis. Numerous studies and attempts have been made to regenerate articular cartilage. In the case of partial degenerative cartilage changes, microfracture and autologous chondrocyte implantation have been proposed as surgical treatment methods, but they have disadvantages such as insufficient mutual binding to the host cells, inaccurate cell delivery, and deterioration of healthy cartilage. Stem cell-based therapies have been developed to compensate for this. This review summarizes the drawbacks and consequences of various cartilage regeneration methods and describes the various attempts to treat cartilage damage. In addition, this review will discuss cartilage regeneration, particularly mesenchymal stem cell engineering-based therapies, and explore how to treat future cartilage regeneration using mesenchymal stem cells.",선종근,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30076244

건강보험심사평가원 자료를 바탕으로 한 당뇨발과 절단에 관한 보고,"Purpose: This study reports on limb amputations in diabetic patients according to gender, age, and region based on the data from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service. Materials and Methods: The number of amputations was compared by region, age, gender, and year, as well as by femoral region, lower leg, foot, and toe in diabetic patients who received limb amputation. This analysis was performed based on the data from the Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service, between January 2009 and December 2014. Results: The total number of amputations between the study period was 9,155. The number of patients who were treated at hospitals for diabetes in 2009 was 1.9 million, among which, 1,214 patients underwent amputation. In 2014, the incidence of diabetes was 1,747 in 2.58 million individuals. With this rising incidence of diabetes, the amputation of limbs due to diabetes is increasing every year. In particular, the following regions were amputated more often: femoral region, 2.3%; lower legs, 19.6%; feet, 18.1%; and toes 60.0%. Regarding gender differences, males showed a higher amputation rate than females for all body parts. With respect to region, Seoul was the highest with 30.2%, followed by Gyeonggi with 19.9%, and Busan with 8.8%. According to age, older age showed greater diabetic amputation rate. Conclusion: In accordance with the rising incidence of diabetes, the diabetic amputation is also increasing. Here, we showed that toes were amputated with the highest percentage and males had greater amputation rate than females for all body parts. Moreover, amputation rate was highest in older diabetic patients, especially for those in their seventies.

다발성 외상의 치료,"To optimize results for polytrauma patients, prompt evacuation and early management are critical. These patients also require a multidisciplinary team effort, involving multiple departments, as they are likely to have not only musculoskeletal injuries but also specific organ injuries or compromised general status. In the 1980s, the goal was definitive fracture fixation in the early stages after injury (early total care). Since the 1990s, however, the goal has shifted to temporary fixation, with a delay of several days prior to definitive fixation (damage control orthopedics). Recently, the timing and extent of treatment have been determined by the condition of patients based on objective indicators. Because surgery may result in secondary damage, it is desirable to minimize potential tissue injury with either temporary fixation or a delay in definitive fixation.",김정재,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106356870

Materials and Methods: Sixty-three patients (63 hips) with femoral neck fractures who were followed more than 3 years were evaluated. The results were assessed by fracture type, accuracy of reduction, type of implants and interval between the fracture and fixation.
Results: Overall complication rate was 36.5% (23/63) in which osteonecrosis was 20.6% (13/63), nonunion 14.3% (9/63) and subtrochanteric fracture 1.6% (1/63). Undisplaced group showed a tendency of higher success rate, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Anatomically reduced group showed significantly higher satisfactory results compared to nonanatomically reduced group (P=0.008, 0.011). There was no significant difference between the results according to time of surgery after injury and implant type.
Conclusion: The anatomical reduction seemed to be a major prognostic factor of osteosynthesis in elderly patients with femoral neck fracture.

골절 후 급성 감염의 체계적 진단 및 치료원칙,"Acute fracture-related infection (FRI) is a common and serious complication of fracture treatment. The clinical symptoms of the patient and the results of the serological, radiological, and histopathological examinations can be divided into ‘Confirmatory’ criteria and ‘Suggestive’ criteria, allowing for the diagnosis of FRI. Treatment principles can be broadly categorized into (1) the DAIR (Debridement, Antimicrobial therapy, Implant Retention) method and (2) the staged reconstruction method. The choice of treatment depends on factors such as the time elapsed after infection, stability of the internal fixation device, reduction status, host physiology, and virulence of the pathogens. Thorough surgical debridement and irrigation, ensuring stability at the fracture site, reconstruction of bone defects, and appropriate soft tissue coverage, along with antibiotic therapy, are essential to suppress or eradicate the infection.

Lack of Correlation between Dynamic Balance and Hamstring-to-Quadriceps Ratio in Patients with Chronic Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears,"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quadriceps and hamstring muscle strength and hamstring-to-quadriceps (HQ) ratio, as well as the relationships of these parameters with dynamic balance, in patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture. Materials and Methods: We compared 25 patients diagnosed with chronic unilateral ACL tears and 25 age-matched healthy volunteers. The maximal torque of the quadriceps and hamstring and dynamic balance were measured. Results: Although the isokinetic maximal peak torques were about 50% lower in the quadriceps (57%, p<0.001) and hamstring (56%, p=0.001) muscles in the chronic ACL tear group than in the control group, their HQ ratios were similar (56%±17% vs. 58%±6%, p=0.591). HQ ratio was significantly correlated with anterior-posterior stability index (r=-0.511, p=0.021) and overall stability index (r=-0.476, p=0.034) in control group, but these correlations were not observed in chronic ACL tear group. Conclusions: Thigh muscle strength was about 50% lower in the chronic ACL tear group than in the control group, but the HQ ratio was similar. The dynamic balance of the knee was not influenced by thigh muscle strength but was influenced by HQ ratio in healthy young individuals. However, HQ ratio was not correlated with dynamic knee balance in chronic ACL tear patients.",( Dae Hee Lee ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100328536

Sleep Disturbance Strongly Related to the Development of Postoperative Delirium in Proximal Femoral Fracture Patients Aged 60 or Older,"Purpose: Post-fracture sleeping disorders can lead to a deterioration of mental and physical health and delay recovery to pre-fracture status. Here, an analysis was conducted to determine if sleep disturbance is a risk factor for delirium in patients older than 60 years of age with surgically treated proximal femoral fractures.
Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 316 patients with surgically treated proximal femoral fractures between January 2014 and December 2016; 33 patients were removed from analysis due to exclusion criteria. Confirmation of delirium was made by a neurologist upon consultation for cognitive impairment and sleeping disorders were confirmed by a doctor or nurse based on the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Potential risk factors other than a sleep disorder (e.g., history of cognitive impairment, medical illness, preoperational levels of albumin and hemoglobin, transfusion) were also analyzed as variables for the development of delirium.
Results: The sensitivity and specificity of a sleeping disorder as a risk factor for the development of delirium were 0.75 and 0.76, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 0.64 and 0.93, respectively. A sleeping disorder was significantly related to the development of the delirium (odds ratio adjusted for age, sex and body mass index was 5.78, P<0.01). In those with a history of cognitive impairment, the adjusted odds ratio for the development of delirium was 6.03 (P<0.01).
Conclusion: Sleeping disorders occurring after a surgically repaired proximal femoral fracture in patients 60 years of age or older could be an independent predictive factor of delirium.",조명래,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105630474
