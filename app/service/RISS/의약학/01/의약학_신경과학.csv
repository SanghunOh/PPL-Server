Methods : This has been carried out as a qualitative case study to understand what the elderly with severe dementia and caregivers experience through the practice of humanitude profoundly. The participants selected in the study are four caregivers who have completed the Humanitude Trainer (Level 1) course and practiced humanitude in the field of caregiving, and they were interviewed with three sessions.
Results : As a result of analyzing the experiences of humanitude practiced by the caregivers on the elderly with severe dementia, this author has come up with total 25 meaning units, 6 subcategories, and 2 core categories. The core categories are ‘change in the elderly with severe dementia through the improved quality of life’ and ‘change in caregivers who have come to respect them as a person’ were explored. It was not easy for the caregivers to accept and practice humanitude from the beginning, and they had to go through trials and errors. Also, there was an increased burden on work, but they tried patiently with a constant will to be a help to the elderly with severe dementia.
Conclusion : This study was explored that the practice of humanitude brings positive changes to both the elderly with severe dementia and caregivers. This is because the research participants who had acquired ‘4 techniques’ and ‘the 5 steps of SSHCP’ for humanitude practiced their caregiving while being respectful for and considerate of the elderly with dementia. Accordingly, this researcher intends to inform our society that is suffering from aging and the increase of dementia patients that not with dementia policies or medical treatments but solely with humanitude caregiving, we can bring positive changes.

파킨슨 증상을 동반한 치매,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is now widely recognized as the second most common form of degenerative dementia after Alzheimer's disease (AD), accounting for up to 20% of cases. It is clinically and neuropathologically distinct from AD, and consensus clinical and pathologic diagnostic critena have been proposed Core clinical features include the tnad of flutuating cognitive impairment, recurrent visual hallucination, and spontaneous parkinsonism. Pathologically, alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin positive, neuronal inclusion Lewy bodies, and Lewy neuritis are found in the neocortex, limbic cortex, subcortical nuclei and brainstem. Neurochemical features of DLB include a marked deficiency in the activity of the choline acetyltransferase. simultaneously to the depletion of cortical acetylcholine, a reduction of dopamine level in the striatum, related to the substantia nigra neuronal loss, is also descnbed. In the blood flow SPECT studies, a subtle difference in perfusion pattern with a greater degree of occipital hypoperfusion has been reported. Accurate diagnosis of DLB is clinically important as the management of psychosis and behavioral disturbance is complicated by sensitivity to neuroleptics. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that DLB may be particularly amenable to cholinergic enhancers.",김재우,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100299060
실험적 중대뇌동맥 폐쇄에 의한 지연성 허혈성 뇌경색,"Although evolution and time course of ischemic brain should be a matter of interest to investigation in the research of brain ischemia as well as traumatic brain injury, few papers have ever been reported.
Authors observed quantitatively sequential changes of infarct size and regional cerebral blood flow(rCBF) to assess the evolution of focal ischemic brain infarct in the rat following left MCAO. Fifteen rats, weighing 250g to 370g, were used in this experiment.
The experiment animals were divided into three groups : 6, 24 and 48 hours groups(HG) after MCAO. The rCBF of bilateral caudate nuclei was measured by hydrogen clearance methods. Areas of brain infarction were delineated by triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride(TTC) at the preselected 8 coronal levels of forebrain. The areas of brain damage were drawn on scale diagrams(×4 actual size) of forebrain and measured by a plannimeter. In the experimental groups, just after MCAO, rCBF of the ipsilateral caudate nucleus was reduced to 20.4±6.5 to 24.6±7.9㎖/100g/min from the basal value of around 117 to 121㎖/100g/min and showed a tendency of getting more reduced to 19.4±7.6㎖/100g/min by 48 hours. The rCBF of the contralateral caudate nucleus was maintained in the basal value throughout the experiment. Comparing the total amounts of ischemic damage of 48HG to those of 6 and 24 HG, the infarction size was significantly increased in cerebral hemisphere as well as cerebral cortex and caudate nucleus(p<0.05). But there was not any significant difference between 6 and 24 HG.
This experiment provides evidence for the evolution of focal ischemic brain infarct without any further change of decreased rCBF. The data suggest that it is disirable to observe the change of pathologic findings by not less than 48 hours following the arterial occlusion in the study of ischemic brain infarction in the rat, paticularly as long as ischemic damage is delineated by TTC.",박춘근,1989,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103065986

알쯔하이머 환자의 인지-임상 정도 평가 척도,"Background：There are many global assessment scales for Alzheimer's disease. The clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), the Global Deterioration scale (GDS) and the Blessed Dementia Rating scale have been widely used for evaluating the severity of dementia and might be useful for measuring the change of a patient's status. the CDR has been regarded as the golden standard for the severity of dementia. However, this interview-based scale takes up to 30 min for the clinician to complete, which is impractical in many clinical settings. Furthermore it is not so much sensitive for detecting the change of disease progression in each cognitive domain. We developed a brief and reliable questionnaire for evaluating the severity of dementia, called Cognitive-Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CCDR). Methods：The CCDR consists of 15 questions that allow to assess the orientation to time, the orientation to place, the orientation to person, memory, attention, language, visuospatial function, frontal executive function, physical self maintenance, home and hobbies, community affair, the duration of dementia, mental alertness, walking ability, onset of abnormal behavior and character change. Ninety-eight probable and possible AD patients received the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR), Korean version of Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and Cognitive-Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CCDR).

This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of IV-tPA in these patients.
Methods: Using data from a prospective multicenter stroke registry between January 2009 and March 2021, we identified AIS patients who received IV-tPA in the 3- to 4.5-hour window, and compared the outcomes of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH), 3-month mortality, 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-1 and 3-month mRS distribution between patients with both PS and DM (PS/DM, n=56) versus those with neither PS nor DM, or with only one (non-PS/DM, n=927).
Results: The PS/DM group versus the non-PS/DM group was more likely to have a prior disability, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary heart disease and less likely to have atrial fibrillation. The PS/DM and the non-PS/DM groups had comparable rates of SICH (0% vs.
1.7%; p>0.999) and 3-month mortality (10.7% vs. 10.2%; p=0.9112). The rate of 3-month mRS 0-1 was non-significantly lower in the PS/DM group than in the non-PS/DM group (30.4% vs. 40.7%; adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.81 [0.41-1.59]).
Conclusions: In the 3- to 4.5-hour window, AIS patients with PS/DM, as compared to those with non-PS/DM, might benefit less from IV-tPA.

알츠하이머병에서 망상,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with cognitive and functional impairment as well as neuropsychiatric complications, including psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Recent studies strongly suggest that delusions should be separated from hallucinations. While AD with delusions is a phenotypically distinct from AD without delusions, subtypes of delusions may also define further distinct clinical entities. There has been also considerable debate as to whether delusions in patients with AD differ etiologically, phenomenologically, and therapeutically from delusions in other primary psychiatric illnesses. In other words, whether they are caused by changes to key areas of the brain that have been linked to the presence of delusions. This has led to speculation that these symptoms may respond better to certain drugs such as cholinesterase inhibitors. Integrating the epidemiology, clinical phenomenology, neuropathological and genetic literature for delusions in AD allows us to speculate on pathophysiology and is essential to making progress in the area of delusions in AD.",곽용태,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99884277

Results: The awareness of the following stroke warning signs increased significantly at 3 months after discharge compared to before receiving the education (all p values <0.001): sudden difficulty in speaking or in understanding speech (74.0→93.7%), sudden numbness or weakness (72.4→92.1%), sudden dizziness (71.7→89.8%), sudden severe headache (44.9→82.7%), and sudden visual impairment (38.6→69.3%). The proportion of patients with a good knowledge of stroke warning signs (defined as providing at least five correct answers) increased significantly, from 38.6% to 81.9%. Almost half of them (46.5%) correctly answered that they should call an ambulance first when someone shows stroke symptoms before receiving the education, with this proportion increasing to 68.5% at 3 months after discharge (p<0.001). The proportions of patients who understood the need for prompt treatment of stroke and the golden time window increased from 80.3% to 96.9% and from 66.1% to 86.6%, respectively (both p<0.001). The proportion of patients with knowledge of thrombolytic therapy for stroke also increased significantly after the in-hospital education, from 11.0% to 76.4% (p<0.001).
Conclusions: In-hospital, in-person education was effective at increasing the understanding that patients have of stroke, even at 3 months after discharge. In-hospital education provided by an education-specialized nurse would be an effective intervention for increasing the likelihood of stroke patients reacting appropriately to stroke recurrence.",이영훈,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104223610
중증근무력증의 증상으로 발현된 대변실금,"I report three cases of fecal incontinence during the clinical course of myasthenia gravis. Fecal incontinence developed after withdrawal from the pyridostigmine and improved after readministration of the pyridostigmine. Myasthenia gravis could affect external anal sphincter and puborectalis function. Myasthenia gravis is presumably one of the causes of fecal incontinence.
We must check for fecal incontinence in the patients with myasthenia gravis.",이상수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105455014
다발성 두개강내 뇌동맥류,"One case of multiple intracranial aneurysms is presented. On carotid angiogram, nine aneurysmal sacs including a giant aneurysm of left middle cerebral artery were detected on the right distal anterior cerebral artery, anterior communicating artery, bifurcation of both internal carotid artery, both middle cerebral artery, and left posterior communicating artery. The authors reviewed the literature, and discussed the incidence, determining the site of rupture, and the operative methods of multiple intracranial aneurysms.",이익모,1988,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107183329
자발성 뇌지주막하출혈 및 두부외상후 혈당치 측정에 의한 예후평가,"To examine the relationship between serum glucose level and the outcome of patients suffering from spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage(SSAH) and head injury, the authors prospectively studied scrum glucose levels in 63 patients of SSAH and in 142 patients with head-trauma admitted within 72 hours after ictus. In SSAH, glucose levels measured at admission showed a statistically significant association with Botterell grade and deposition of blood on computerized tomography(CT) scans. As assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale(GOS) at 1 months, good recovery occurred in 78.1% of patients with glucose level below 160mg%, good recovery was only found in 12.5% of patients with hyperglycemia(>160mg)(p<0.001). In head-injured patients similar correlation was also noticed there were also similar finding between blood glucose level on admission and Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS). Good recovery occurred in 93.2% of patients with normal glucose levels(≤120mg%) while only in 44.8% from patients with hyperglycemia(>120mg%)(p<0.001). These data suggest that hyperglycemia on admission is a component of the stress response to head injury and SSAH. It serves as a useful indicator of severity of injury, and a significant predictor of outcome from SSAH and head injury.",조성진,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100299065
뇌종양과 동반된 두통의 특성에 관한 분석,"Objective：We analyzed the headache characteristics in patients with a brain tumor and its correlation with the grade of the tumor. Methods：Brain tumor patients with and without headaches were recruited. Sex, age, combined symptoms, neurological findings, and radiological characteristics were reviewed in both groups. Results：Sixty-nine patients(46 with and 23 without headache) comprised our study population. Intracranial pressure (ICP) symptoms were more prevalent in the headache group compared to the non-headache group(p=0.012). However, no other clinical differences were noted between the two groups. The prevalence of headache was increased in patients with metastatic brain tumor than primary brain tumor but there was no statistical significance. The characteristics of the headache were non-specific and could not be differentiated between malignant and benign brain tumors. Conclusion：Headache in brain tumor patients present in a non-specific characteristic. In patients with symptoms suggestive of an increased ICP or malignancy from another organ, further imaging may be warranted.",심숙영 ( Sook Young Sim ),2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99577614

미세 먼지와 치매: 대기 오염이 인지 건강과 관계 있을까?,"Air pollution is a growing global health concern estimated to contribute to as many as 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year. So it poses the greatest environmental risk to human health. A strong and rapidly expanding body of evidence links ambient air pollution to respiratory and cardiovascular conditions that eventually may also affect cognition in the elderly. Among various ambient air pollutants, particulate matter (PM) has been implicated as a chronic source of neuroinflammation and reactive oxygen species that produce neuropathology resulting in neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative disease. The current review will briefly discuss the clinical features and underlying mechanism of PM induced cognitive dysfunction, more specifically, dementia.",한설희,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107183459
