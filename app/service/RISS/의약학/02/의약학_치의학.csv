한국인의 설탕섭취량과 치아우식증: 역사학적 고찰,"Objectives. The present study was done to discover how the increase in sugar consumption in Korea since the end of the 19th century has affected the prevalence of dental caries. Methods. Materials were analyzed chronologically following historical periodization. Comparisons with North Korea and Japan were made. Results. Sugar consumption increased between 1884 and the early 2000s. The DMFT index of 12-year-olds was 0.6 in 1972 and 3.3 in 2000. By the early 2000s, sugar became the processed food most consumed by Koreans averaging 23.7 kg (2000~2006) per person per year, which is slightly above the world average. However, the DMFT index decreased to 2.16 in 2006. This occurred because the traditional Korean diet has rice as a staple food and because preventive included sealants, and multiple fluoride applications. Conclusions. More than a century after sugar was first imported into Korea in 1884, sugar consumption is still higher and is associated with increases in dental caries. Moreover, Korean children still over-consume-sugar. Thus, further education and investigation of the problem are required.",이주연 ( Jue Yeon Lee ),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82398135

장애인 치과 치료의 실제와 구강위생관리를 위한 고려사항,"Dental treatment for the disabled requires special consideration. Due to poor cooperation of the patient during dental procedures, behavioral management or general anesthesia is often necessary. We also need to consider the patient’s oral habits and ability to maintain oral hygiene. Since dental treatment may be difficult for the disabled, prevent is more important than treatment itself. In addition, secondary dental caries and periodontal disease after treatment are likely to occur when proper oral care is not sustained. Because the patient is difficult to maintain optimal oral hygiene by themselves, it is essential to educate the guardian about the importance of oral hygiene, as well as encourage them to participate in the patient’s daily oral care. Finally, it is necessary to regularly check the patient’s oral hygiene status and perform professional plaque control through frequent dental visit.",곽은정(Eun-Jung Kwak),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107261639
"2020년 비대면 온라인 강의만족도와 강의효과, 대면강의 필요성에 대한 연구: 경기도 성남시 소재 S 대학교 보건계열 학생을 중심으로","Purpose: This study examined the correlations between the satisfaction and effectiveness of practical training and theory lectures under two conditions: face-to-face lectures and non-face-to-face online lectures. Methods: A survey of 436 public health student, whereafter SPSS 20.0 (IBM) was used on the data to conduct frequency, descriptive statistics, and exploratory factor analyses. The Cronbach's α value was estimated in a reliability analysis, and a simple regression analysis was conducted to verify the study hypothesis. Results: It was found that the students preferred pre-recorded lectures online for both practical training and theory, claiming that when compared with face-to-face lectures, these non-face-to-face lectures meant a shorter commute and the ability to repeat the content. However, it was admitted that technical issues such as facilities or access difficulties and lower concentration could be a problem. The hypothesis that course satisfaction affects lecture effectiveness was verified, with both the practical training and theory lectures found to have a statistically significant positive (+) effect. The explanatory power of student satisfaction on the effectiveness of the theory component was slightly higher than that of the practical training component, with the students having more positive perceptions on the necessity of face-to-face lectures in practical training than they did for those in theoretical instruction. Conclusion: Providing non-face-to-face online theory courses and face-to-face practical training courses could increase student satisfaction and lecture effectiveness.",정혜은,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107772446

"인공지능 딥러닝의 역사와 현황, 그리고 미래 방향","Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, and machine learning is also a subset of artificial intelligence (AI). The biggest difference between machine learning and deep learning is that in the learning of artificial intelligence models, machine learning basically requires a human feature extraction process before learning, but deep learning does not require this process and the original data is directly used as input. The development of deep learning coincides with the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs), and many people have contributed to the development of artificial neural networks for decades. The following five models are the representative architectures most widely used in deep learning. That is, Deep Feedforward Neural Network (DFFNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Autoencoders (AE), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a feedforward NN composed of a convolutional layer, a ReLU activation function, and a pooling layer. CNNs provide properties of weight sharing and local connectivity to process high-dimensional data. In dental and medical fields, an AI model that can be interpretable or explainable (XAI) is needed to increase patient persuasiveness. In the future, explainable AI (XAI) will become an indispensable and practical component in order to obtain an improved, transparent, secure, fair and unbiased AI learning model.",이원진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108117783
인공지능의 미래,"Recently, AI has made rapid developments in various fields.
Therefore, it is meaningful to look into the future of AI in the dental field and what needs to be supplemented to minimize its side effects. In this article, the future of AI technology in the dental field in the near future and the coping direction were summarized based on the insights of the papers on the future of AI in this field. In the future, AI will be able to provide more useful diagnosis and treatment planning assistance by comprehensively analyzing various information such as EMR data, article, genome, and wearable data as well as X-ray image. In addition, the efficiency of dental work will be improved by automating the design of the laboratory work and device. This efficiency can be extended from dental inventory to patient appointment management, and instant feedback in the clinic, and eventually develop into an comprehensive dental care system. With the advent of more advanced natural language processing systems, smart AI assistants who can have conversations about treatment and dental operations will appear. In addition, face-to-face contact with patients will increase along with AI-based charting automation, and AI will improve the patient experience, allowing more patients to receive appropriate oral health care. As AI is expected to be broadly applied to dentistry, a basic understanding of how big data is collected and how AI algorithms are programmed is now essential for dentists as well.",황재준,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108117782

소아 및 청소년의 심리/인지적 발달,"Psychological and cognitive development in child and adolescent periods is key knowledge for understanding children and adolescents’ behavior and inducing their actions. So far, psychoanalytic approaches have been primarily researched by Freud’s analytical tools and Piaget’s analysis on cognitive developments have been mainly employed to explore children and adolescents’ psychological developments. In addition, other various theories have been suggested in order to explain children and adolescents’ psychological developments. However, in reality, it is difficult to integrate diverse theoretical lens to investigate children and adolescents’ psychological developments. Considering this constraint, in clinical dentistry, the conventional theoretical instruments have been still widely employed to guide children and adolescents’ behavior.",송제선(Je Seon Song),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102260943
