However, as a result, various social problems (unethical puppy mills, conflicts between companions and non-companions, increase in abandoned animals, dog bite accidents, etc.) are occurring. In particular, social costs are increasing due to the increase in lost and abandoned animals, so it is necessary to reduce lost and abandoned animals and promote adoption. However, this problem is not simply a matter of the increase in companion animals. It is related to social problems such as the factory breeding business, the adoption of companion animals without sufficient understanding of companion animals, the perception that abandoned animals are not healthy, lack of guidance in the adoption process, and dissolution of adoption. Therefore, in this review, domestic and overseas cases were compared and necessary improvement measures were found in the process of adopting a companion animal.
It is expected that the occurrence of abandoned animals will be reduced by making animal registration mandatory with a built-in wireless identification device. In addition, it is necessary to prevent the impulsive adoption of a companion animal by providing an education system for adopters so that they can adopt with sufficient education and consideration period. It is also important to eliminate prejudice against the adoption of abandoned animals by checking the health of animals under protection from animal shelters. Furthermore, it is necessary to make efforts to lead to the formation of a social community and the promotion of the adoption of abandoned animals by operating an education program that continuously spreads companion culture based on the local community.",한세명(Sei-Myoung Han),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108475725
동물실험의 대안은?,"In this review, I will describe what alternative approaches consist of and how they contribute to the reduction, refinement, or replacement of animals in some research situations, known as the 3 R`s, developed by Russell and Burch in 1959. An alternative is any technique that replaces the use of experimental animals, reduces the use for experiment animals, or that refines a technique to lessen the distress or pain that may be involved in the experimental procedure. The mean of alternative may imply whole or partial substitution for some existing technique or approach using live animals. There can be a lot of types of alternatives that use inanimate systems such as computer simulations, film or CD, in vitro systems such as cell or organ cultures. The use of vertebrate animals lower on the phylogenetic scale or invertebrate animals may be considered as alternatives. Scientist should take the advantages and disadvantages of alternatives systems into consideration. An alternative system should be humane, inexpensive, precise, or well validated, so that it will be likely to find significant acceptance.",박재학 ( Jae Hak Park ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75524170

국내 인체피부모델을 이용한 광독성 동물대체시험법 개발 연구,"Human reconstituted epidermis models have been widely used in evaluating phototoxicity. However, human reconstituted epidermis models made in Korea have not been employed to assess phototoxicity. In this study, we conducted an in vitro phototoxicity test with Neoderm<sup>®</sup>-E, human reconstituted epidermis model from Korea, in order to see if the model could be used for the evaluation of phototoxicity. Firstly, we performed an UVA sensitivity test and selected 6 J/cm<sup>2</sup> for an UVA irradiation dose. Chlorpromazine as a positive control was then tested to confirm that the substance induces phototoxicity in this model. Afterwards, 3 phototoxins and 2 non-phototoxins were tested using Neoderm<sup>®</sup>-E and Epiderm<sup>TM</sup>, a generally used phototoxicity test model, to compare prediction results for each chemical. The results indicated that all those 5 chemicals were correctly predicted with Neoderm<sup>®</sup>-E, which was accordant with the phototoxic information on them. However, only 3 chemicals were correctly predicted with Epiderm<sup>TM</sup>. Consequently, the predictive capacity of the test with Neoderm<sup>®</sup>-E could be higher than that using Epiderm<sup>TM</sup>.

A novel approch of usage of Gram staining to indentify Mycobacterium tuberculosis from tissues,"Tuberculosis is a potentially deadly infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Tuberculosis is diagnosed by proving the M. tuberculosis in sputum samples based on the results of acid-resistant staining, culture, and nucleic acid amplification tests. However, there is a report that the detection rate of M. tuberculosis is low in acid-resistant staining using tissue specimens. It has been suspected that the cause is a potential loss of acid resistance by the organic solvents used for tissue specimen preparation. Therefore, this study was pursued to find out if Gram staining and fluorescent staining in addition to acid-resistant staining would be helpful in diagnosing tuberculosis. We used four tissue (lung, small intestine, large intestine, and lymph node) samples with chronic granulomatous inflammation observed in HE staining and positive results in real-time PCR. These detection rates and staining properties were investigated through microscopic examination using the Ziehl-Neelsen, Gram, and Auramin rhodamine staining. In this studies, M. tuberculosis were observed by Ziehl-Neelsen, Gram, and Auramin rhodamine staining in all four samples. In the evaluation of clinical microbiology proficiency testing (CMPT), the Ziehl-Neelsen and Gram staining were the same result, but the Auramin rhodamine staining was relatively low. These data indicated that Gram staining is useful for detecting M. tuberculosis in formalin-fixed tissue specimens. Therefore, if the Ziehl-Neelsen and Gram staining are combined as the M. tuberculosis staining method in tissue specimens, a better direction may be provided for tuberculosis diagnosis.",Jin Mok Kim(Jin Mok Kim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108533580

연잎 추출물과 연잎 발효 추출물의 항산화 및 항염 효과 비교,"This study tended to identify the potential as functional natural materials for soothing of skin and scalp using lotus leaf hot water extract (Nelumbo nucifera hot water extract, NHWE) and fermented lotus leaf extract (fermented nelumbo nucifera leaf extract, FNLE).
The antioxidant evaluations such as total polyphenol and flavonoid content, DPPH electron-donating ability, and ABTS radical scavenging ability, were measured. Cell survival rate was measured in Raw 264.7 cells treated with LPS to check the toxicity, and the inhibitory rate of NO-producing and TNF-α and COX-2 protein expression were measured in Raw 264.7 cells after treatment of LPS in order to evaluate the efficacy of anti-inflammatory effect.
NHWE and FNLE showed 182.2 mg/g and 103.3 mg/g each in total polyphenol contents, and 26.8 mg/g and 49.1 mg/g each in flavonoid content. As for ABTS radical scavenging ability, high levels of antioxidants (86.6% and 93.7% in NHWE and FNLE) appeared at the concentration of 1000 μg/mL. In DPPH electron-donating ability, NHWE and FNLE showed 66.1% and 73.3% at 1000 μg/mL. FNLE had more antioxidant ability than NHWE. In anti-inflammatory effects, inhibition rate of NO production by LPS increased in a concentration-dependent manner at both NHWE and FNLE, and TNF-α and COX-2 expressions were also decreased by treatment of NHWE and FNLE. In particular, 200 μg/mL of FNLE showed the best anti-inflammatory effect.
In summary, fermented lotus leaf extract showed good efficacy in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory tests, and its potential as a functional ingredients was confirmed. It is expected that not only the soothing effect of the scalp and skin, but also the possibility of application as a functional food can be expanded, and it is considered to be suitable as a natural functional raw material.",김지은 ( Jieun Kim ),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107185260
Autosomal-dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease in a Family of Scottish Fold Cats,"Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (AD-PKD) is common in Persian and Persian-related breeds,and is sporadically reported in Scottish Fold cats.

"Serological and molecular prevalence of lumpy skin disease virus in Korean water deer, native and dairy cattle in Korea","Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a severe cross-border infectious disease that causes fever, skin and vis-ceral nodules in cattle. LSD is caused by the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), a dsDNA virus that be-longs to the genus Capripoxvirus. Although LSD has been found only in Southern Africa tradition-ally, in the last decade it is spreading very quickly through the Middle East and into Eastern Europe and China. It usually affects cattle and water buffalos being transmitted by blood-feeding insects. As it causes a huge economic impact, LSD is a notifiable disease by World Organisation for Animal Health, and managed as the legal infectious disease class I in Korea. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to confirm the existence of LSDV antigens or antibodies in Korean livestock. We collected 1,200 blood samples from cattle (Korean native and dairy cattle) and Korean water deer in 4 major provinces of the country, then tested the existence of LSDV antigen and antibody. None (0.0%) of the 1,200 blood samples were positive for both antigen and antibody of LSDV. To the best of our knowl-edge, this is the first study that examines the prevalence of LSDV in Korea. Our study aims to report the LSDV occurrence situation obtained by surveillance in Korea and provide information that may help prevention of LSD epidemics.",Young-Seung Ko,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108193358
개의 정형외과 수술 후 재활치료 효과,"Rehabilitation treatments after orthopedic surgery promote postoperative healing in humans. In veterinary medicine, there is increased interest in rehabilitation treatments because they are potentially beneficial to animals in the post-operation period. This study examined the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment in dogs that underwent orthopedic surgeries, including femoral head & neck ostectomy (FHNO) and medial patellar luxation treatment (MPLT). The group that received the rehabilitation treatment after FHNO (1.88 weeks) showed a significantly shorter recovery length of 6.62 weeks compared to those that did not receive the treatment (8.50 weeks). The other group that received the rehabilitation treatment after MPLT (4.38 weeks) showed a significantly shorter recovery length of 5.01 weeks compared to those that did not receive the treatment (9.39 weeks). For the qualitative evaluation, the types and frequencies of rehabilitation treatments were monitored.

Agar-Gel Immunodiffusion Test를 이용한 돼지흉막폐염(Swine Pleuropneumoniae)의 진단에 관한 연구,"To establish an effective diagnostic measure for detection of the antibodies against Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, that is the primary agent of swine pleuropneumoniae, the methods for micro-agglutination test(MAT) and agar-gel immunodiffusion test(AGID) were improved and standarized and the comparative studies were carried out.
The results obtained through the experiments were summarized as follows.
1. The rabbit hyperimmune sera to reference serotypes 1 to 6 were cross-tested with MAT and AGID. The range of antibody titers on MAT was 80 to 1280, showing the cross-reaction in serotypes 3, 4, 5 and 6. In AGID, the range of antigen titers was 8 to 32, and cross-reaction was observed in serotype 5. The optimal concentration of antigen MAT were 1.25㎎/㎖
2. In AGID, the most promising antigen and the buffer for agar-gel were EDTA-treated antigen and 0.05M tris buffer(pH 7.2), respectively.
3. By the tests for 200 swine sera, it was found that the accumulative frequency of positive reaction for the 6 serotypes were 240 in MAT and 163 in AGID.
4. when compared the results of AGID with those of MAT for 200 swine sera, all sera with MAT titier under 20 were negative in AGID. Of the sera with MAT titer 40 and 80, 24.7% and 93.9% were positive in AGID, respectively. All sera with MAT titer over 160 showed positive in AGID.
5. In conclusion, the established MAT showed high sensitivity but low specificity, whereas AGID revealed low sensitivity but high specificity. The established AGID test was considered very efficient for detection of antibodies and serotyping of swine sera.",심항섭,1994,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19592254

원저 : 가정용 정수기의 미생물학적 안전성 평가,"A water purifiers for home-use has been popularly used as increasing distrust of the drinking tap water in views of safety. Besides, chlorination of drinking water can produce trihalomethanes known as a carcinogens. In general, a water purifier is known to remove risk factors such as infectious microorganisms, harmful chemicals and heavy metals. We compared the change of water components before and after purification by a water purifier and evaluated the results whether this purification system is reliable or not for safety of drinking water. The samples of water from 11 sites at the campus of Jeju National University were examined by physicochemical analyses, including concentration of sodium, potassium, chloride, residual chlorine, boron, nitrate nitrogen, sulfur, hexavalent chromium, copper, iron, aluminium, silicon, selenium, vanadium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, arsenic, antimony, zinc, cadmium, lead, strontium. Microbiological analysis was performed by counting mesophilic bacterial colonies. Almost of all the physicochemical components after purification were shown to decrease tendency of their concentrations but not significantly differenty except that of residual chlorine. Mesophilic bacterial counts after purification were shown to increase when compared to those of tap water. All the tap water was met the acceptance of requirement of drinking water, but samples of the water after purification were failed (4 from 11). After draining generous amount of water from a purifier, bacterial counts were observed to show a decreased tendency. Bacterial colonies were not detected when the concentration of residual chlorine was higher than 0.2 ppm. Although seasonal factors and maintenance condition were not concerned in this study, higher bacterial counts in purified water could cause some problems in using water purifier for home-use.

We developed a skin sensitization method through consolidation of mouse ear swelling test and mouse local lymph node assay. Sensitization of BALB / c mice with potassium dichromate, a well known skin sensitizer, was established through intra－dermal injection of emulsion containing 50 ㎕ of 20 mM potassium dichromate and 50 ㎕ complete Fleund`s adjuvant (CFA) into both flanks. Control mice were treated with CFA only. Thereafter, 10 days later, mice were challenged by injecting 20 ㎕of 3.5 mM potassium dichromate into pinnae of one ear and saline vehicle into that of another ear. Increment of ear thickness was determined using ear thickness guage 48 hour later of the challenge. In vitro BrdU proliferation assay was undertaken using auricular lymph node cells in the presence (1, 10 nM) or absence of potassium dichromate. Number of lymph node cells was significantly elevated in the chrome－sensitized / challenged mice than the other control mice. Ear swelling index, obtained through subtracting ear thickness before challenge from that after the challenge, was also significantly higher in the chrome－sensitized / challenged mice. Furthermore, in vitro auricular lymph node cell proliferation index was nearly two－fold higher at the chrome－sensitized / challenged mice than the other control mice.

Dobutamine 투여 후 발생한 개의 서맥 1례,"A 13-year-old, castrated male, Shih Tzu dog with a history of acute ataxia was referred to veterinary medicalteaching hospital and anesthetized for diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging of cervical intervertebral disk disease.
After preanesthetic evaluation including physical examination, blood chemistry, radiography and ultrasound, the patientwas premedicated with intravenous butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg). Anesthesia was induced by intravenous propofol (6 mg/kg) and maintained with isoflurane at 1.2 minimal alveolar concentrations. Because the mean arterial pressure (MAP)decreased from 70 to 58 mmHg at 70 minutes after induction, dobutamine was administered by constant rate infusion(5 μg/kg/min) to treat hypotension. However MAP did not increase, and heart rate rapidly decreased from 100 to 55beats per minute (bpm). To treat bradycardia, intravenous glycopyrrolate (5 μg/kg) was administered, and heart rateincreased to 165 bpm. After extubation of endotracheal tube, the patient showed normal recovery without any problemsrelated to cardiovascular system.

The current status of dog meat industry in south korea and recommendations for animal welfare and public health,"South Korea, one of the representative countries known for consuming dog meat, is experiencing a gradual decline in its consumption, and it is expected to be eradicated soon as there is no influx of new consumers. However, the cultural aspect of dog meat consumption is strong as it is deeply rooted in social traditions, and there is inadequate agreement on banning it legally. This article examines the laws related to dog meat and how it is currently managed. It also scrutinizes the animal welfare and food safety aspects of the process of dog meat breeding and distribution. The current legal management system for dog meat is inadequate, which poses risks in terms of food safety. In addition, the dogs used for food consumption are exposed to coarse environments from an animal welfare perspective. Until dog meat consumption is naturally eradicated, establishing a temporary hygiene management system to ensure food safety and improve animal welfare could be one solution.",Yebin Han(Yebin Han),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108533605
Computed Tomographic Features of Canine Ovarian Masses,"This paper describes the computed tomographic features of ovarian masses in dogs. The CT images of female dogs with a confirmed histological diagnosis of ovarian tumors or ovarian cystic diseases were studied retrospectively. Seven dogs met the inclusion criteria. The morphological features of ovarian tumors and ovarian cystic diseases coincided to a certain degree, but ovarian tumors tended to be predominantly solid. Objective measurements of Hounsfield units (HU) suggest that benign lesions may show lower HU values than malignant tumors and mild contrast enhancement because of the small soft tissue composition.

In vitro 피부 감작 대체법들은 복잡한 생물학적 과정의 감작성 메커니즘 중 하나만 대변하므로, 한 가지 시험법만으로 평가하기에는 한계가 있다. 그러므로 최근에는 예측력을 높이기 위해 대체 시험법들을 조합하는 방식인 Integrated Testing Strategies (ITS) 개념을 활용하고 있으며, 본 연구에서도 피부감작성을 평가하는 시험법들을 이용한 ITS접근법으로 Unsaturated fatty acid의 위양성 판정을 극복할 수 있는지 알아보았다. 그 결과, GPMT결과와 비교시 LLNA결과는 33.33%의 accuracy를 보이는 반면 피부 감작성 대체시험법들은 66.6∼83.3%의 accuracy로 더 높은 정확도를 보였다. 단일 시험법 외에도 두 가지 혹은 세 가지 시험법을 조합한 ITS접근법으로 피부 감작성을 판정하였는데, Spectro-DPRA와 ARE-Nrf2 Luciferase Test를 조합한 ITS접근법과 세 가지 시험법 조합법 중 셋 다 양성을 양성으로 판단하는 조합법이 가장 높은 accuracy를 보였다. 따라서 Unsaturated fatty acid와 유사한 단일 원료 혹은 이들 원료를 함유하는 복합물질의 평가시에는 이와 같은 ITS접근법으로 평가하는 것이 효과적일 것으로 판단된다.",박세라 ( Sae-ra Park ),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102717520
호흡마취 유도제로서 alfaxalone의 후향적 평가: 150례,"This study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of alfaxalone for induction of inhalation anesthesia in small animal practice. Patient data were collected according to anesthetic records (136 dogs and 14 cats) presented to the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital of Seoul National University for surgeries and diagnostic imaging from July 2013 to March 2014. Anesthetic results included signalment, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, premedicated drugs, procedures, induction quality, and recovery after anesthesia. One hundred fifty anesthetic events were classified according to the ASA grade. Three patients were ASA grade I, 52 patients grade II, 86 patients grade III, and 9 patients grade IV, respectively. The most common premedication was midazolam and hydromorphone combination (n = 59, 39.3%) follow by acepromazine and hydromorphone combination (n = 22, 14.7%). The majority of anesthesia procedures were diagnostic imaging (n = 33, 22.0%) and ophthalmic surgeries (n = 31, 20.7%), followed by soft tissue surgeries (n = 27, 18.0%), and orthopedic surgeries (n = 20, 13.3%). Intravenous alfaxalone provided smooth induction for inhalation anesthesia in almost cases, but transient apnea and twitching/paddling were observed after induction and during recovery, respectively. In addition, alfaxalone did not show pain response during intravenous administration. Alfaxalone showed smooth induction of inhalation anesthesia in dogs and cats with mild to severe systemic disease (ASA 2-4). Alfaxalone was considered as an acceptable induction agent for patients with higher risk in small animal practice.",장민,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104695761

개에서 발생한 이혈종의 임상적 관리,"A 14-year-old male pomeranian was present with swollen left ear. The swelling occurred from base to apex of pinna. Otitis externa persisted for two years. Hematological and serum biochemistry values were not remarkable. The surgery treatment was the most appropriate method among indwelling drain, surgical, and steroid treatment in the aural hematoma because the dog was very sensitive to touching pinna and the size of aural hematoma. Longitudinal incision was applied after general anesthesia. Cefovecin was injected to prevent secondary infection. The outcome of surgery was good. There was no evidence of recurrence for one year.",이우철,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99804017
소 질병의 혈액화학적 연구,"In prder to clarify the changes of serum chemical values(AST, CPK and LDH activities)and LDH isoenzyme fractions in frequent occuring some diseases of dairy cows, total 48 cows(40 patients: 18 with downer cow syndrome, 17 with abomasal displacement and 5 with acute mastitis and 8 controls: clinically healthy cows) were examined.
The results obtained were as follows:
1. In changes of total serum enzyme activities of patients group, increase of serum AST(P＜0.001), CPK(P＜0.01) and LDH activities(P＜0.01)were observed in groups of downer cow syndrome and abomasal displacement, respectively by comparison with control group. Increase of AST only was found in group of acute mastitis(P＜0.05).
2. In LDH isoenzyme fractions, increase of LDH₁(P＜0.01), LDH₂(P＜0.05), LDH₃(P＜0.01), LDH₄(P＜0.01) and LDH_5(P＜0.01)fractiona was observed in group of downer cow syndrome and also marker increase of LDH4 and LDH5 fractions was noted in this group. The increase of LDH₁, LDH₂ amd LDH₃ (P＜0.01)fractions was found in group of abomasal displacement, but group of acute mastitis showed similar result to that of control group.",김덕환,1994,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19592081
제주동물보호소 유기동물 현황 및 실태분석,"This study investigated the status and analyzed of stray dogs, stray cats admitted to the Jeju Animal Shelter during the year of 2015 to 2019, and the infection rates of specific diseases for abandoned dogs. In addition, in 2017 to 2019, the collected intake and outcome data were reviewed to analyze shelter capacity in terms of housing capacity (monthly daily average intake, required holding capacity, and adoption-driven capacity), staff capacity (staff hours required for daily care). Out of 24,557 dogs admitted to the shelter, owners of 1,808 dogs (7.4%) visited the shelter and found their lost dogs, while 3,612 dogs (14.7%) were adopted to new families. However, the number of puppies that were euthanized was the highest at 12,266 (49.9%), and 6,876 (28%) died either death from disease or natural causes because they were detained in shelters. The monthly daily average (MDA), which is one of the indicators for efficient population management of Jeju Animal Shelter, was found to be 17.4 for abandoned dogs and 1.7 for abandoned cats. Seasonal variations were observed for MDA, RHC, MDA adoptions, ADC, and RSDC, indicating that various strategies are needed for shelter management. This study was performed to analyze and interpret meaningful statistics for improving the efficiency of animal shelters in Jeju. However, inconsistent collection of animal statistics limited data compilation. Creation of a basic animal statistics matrix with reference to well-designed matrices from recognized professional animal shelters is essential.",오명운 ( Myoungoon Oh ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107984184
자돈 분변 유래 병원성 대장균의 병원성 인자 및 항생제 내성 양상,"Pathogenic Escherichia coli is the cause of a wide range of diseases in pigs, including diarrhea, edema disease, and septicemia. Diarrhea caused E. coli may result in significant economic losses, making pathogenic E. coli an important pathogen for the swine industry. This study investigated the preva-lence of virulence factor genes, antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, and resistance genes in E. coli isolated from feces of piglets in Korea between 2017 and 2020. As a result, 119 pathogenic E. coli isolates were obtained from 601 fecal samples. The F4 adhesin gene and the STb enterotoxin gene were commonly present in E. coli isolated from diarrhea samples. The dominant virulotypes of iso-lates from diarrhea samples were STb, Stx2e, and F4:LT:STb. More than 80% of the screened isolates were resistant to ampicillin, sulfisoxazole, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline. To confirm the resistance mechanisms for β-lactam or quinolone, we investigated the genotypic factors of resistance. Each of the ceftiofur-resistant E. coli produced an extended-spectrum β-lactamase encoded by bla CTX-M-14, bla CTX-M-27, and bla CTX-M-55. And all ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli harbored mutations in quinolone-resistance-determining-regions. In addition, some of the ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli contained the plasmid-mediated-quinolone-resistance genes such as qepA , qnrB1 , or qnrD . This study has con-firmed that the F4 fimbria and the STb enterotoxin are the most predominant in pathogenic E. coli isolated from piglets with diarrhea in Korea and there is a great need for responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials to treat colibacillosis.",Hyun Sook Shin,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530468
표적화 차세대염기서열분석법을 이용한 인수공통 바이러스의 유전체 역학과 예찰,"Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic viruses become critical public health, economic, societal, and cultural burdens. The Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic reveals needs for effective preparedness and responsiveness against the emergence of variants and the next vi-rus outbreak. The targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) significantly contributes to the acquisition of viral genome sequences directly from clinical specimens. Using this ad-vanced NGS technology, the genomic epidemiology and surveillance play a critical role in identifying of infectious source and origin, tracking of transmission chains and virus evo-lution, and characterizing the virulence and developing of vaccines during the outbreak. In this review, we highlight the platforms and preparation of targeted NGS for the viral genomics. We also demonstrate the application of this strategy to take advantage of the responsiveness and preven-tion of emerging zoonotic viruses. This article provides broad and deep insights into the prepared-ness and responsiveness for the next zoonotic virus outbreak.",Seonghyeon Lee,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530485
PCR을 이용한 국내 및 수입 축산물 유래 Listeria monocytogenes의 유전학적 분석연구,"One hundred-fifty two of Listeria strains were isolated from domestic chicken carcasses, a slaughter-houses from nationwide from 1996 to 1997 and imported livestock products from a ten foreign countries including the USA, China, France and Thailand. To substitute the laborious and time consuming procedures of clinical laboratory standard diagnostic methods, the rapid and specific multiplex PCR(M-PCR), which was designed to amplify a three kinds of genes simultaneously f3r specific detection and differentiation of L. monocytogenes(LM) by one step procedure, was established. The LM strains confirmed with M-PCR were analysed to their genetic diversities by RAPD using the two primers(D87 & MMTl), and also evaluated on their discriminatory abilities(na) between two primers. our study also conducted the REP-PCR and ERIC-PCR for evaluation of the possibility of REP and ERIC elements for genetic subtyping of LM strains. According to the REP-PCR and ERIC-PCR fingerprinting patterns, LM strains were divided into 7(ERIC-type) and 4(REP-type) major clusters at the relative clone cut off value of 80%. According to the computer analysis of PCR results using the GelCompar Ⅱ software, ERIC-PCR(DI=0.955) had expressed the most high discriminatory ability and followed by REP-PCR(DI=0.952), RAPD(D87; 0.954, MMT1; 0.937), in order. The combined analysis of the present PCR results was also expressed the reliable and useful discriminatory ability(DI=0.916). This study suggested that PCR based methods could be used as an reliable, reproducible, rapid, and highly discriminatory method for the genetic differentiation of genus Listeria.",우용구,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40033645
