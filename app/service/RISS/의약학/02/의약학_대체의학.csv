장내 세균 불균형과 비만,"According to recent research results, approximately 40 trillion bacteria exist in the human gut, and this gut microbiota interact with our body from birth and contribute to maintaining our health. In order to maintain healthy gut microbiota, there are dietary habits such as a low fat and a high fiber diet. The preference of a high fat or a low fiber diet, and antibiotic ingestion is the cause of the gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis leads to decreased production of secondary bile acids, decreased production of short-chain fatty acids, and inflammation, which contributing to the onset of obesity. Therapeutic strategy using beneficial bacteria and non-absorbable antibiotics has been studied as a clinical approach for the treatment of gut dysbiosis, but this application did not cause clinically significant weight change. However, since the metabolic indicators related to obesity have improved, it is necessary to develop a therapeutic approach to gut dysbiosis in the treatment of obesity. In addition, there are not many studies on the analysis of intestinal bacteria at the species level or strain level related to intestinal bacterial imbalance, so further studies are needed to be conducted.

호르몬 불균형과 상호작용의 통합적 이해 : 호르몬 불균형과 상호작용,"To summarize the maintenance of homeostasis in our body in terms of signal transduction, there are two major axes: the autonomic nervous system and hormones. The autonomic nervous system, one of the peripheral nerves, secretes neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and acetylcholine to affect target organs quickly and efficiently. Hormones can be viewed as signals that trigger larger changes in the DNA level after they are secreted into the blood and reach target cells. The autonomic nervous system plays the role of a fine screw that regulates the body s functions according to internal and external stimuli, while hormones play the role of a coarse screw. The autonomic nervous system plays the role of a fine screw that fine-tunes the body s functions according to internal and external stimuli, while hormones play the role of a coarse screw. Adrenal hormones are involved in the circadian cycle and vitality of life, and most actively cope with stress and external changes. It can also affect other hormones such as thyroid hormones, sex hormones, and insulin, and also interacts with the autonomic nervous system in the pituitary gland. In the past, growth hormone supplementation therapy was the main concern in the field of anti-aging medicine, but recently, research on the interaction between other hormones has become an important issue.

히스타민 불균형의 기능의학적 접근과 관리,"Histamine is known as a substance that causes allergies and anaphylaxis, but, in fact, it is a kind of inflammatory cytokine which is involved in immune and inflammatory responses that protect from external materials. Especially, it is involved in the removal of dust, parasites, and bacteria. Histamine mainly plays a role in physically washing or sterilizing these substances through vasodilation, increasing mucus secretion and expectoration, smooth muscle contraction, and gastric acid secretion. In addition, histamine has central nervous system effects such as arousal and memory, because it is necessary to remember and avoid harmful exposures. Like other cytokines, histamine must be produced, released, and degraded in a balance for proper action. When this balance is broken, various non-specific symptoms from histamine excess, such as rhinitis, urticarial, itching sense, abdominal cramp, diarrhea, epigastric burning, chronic cough, headache, dizziness, edema, insomnia, nervousness and irritability can be appeared. It is defined as “histamine imbalance” in functional medicine, and some researchers are called it as “histamine syndrome”. There can be several causes, but allergies and chronic subclinical inflammation are particularly important. The importance of histamine imbalance is increasing because there are many factors for subclinical inflammation in modern society, such as environmental pollution including fine dust, lack of sleep and exercise, increased carbohydrate consumption with decreased vitamin and mineral intake, and infectious disease like Coronavirus disease-2019.

장내 세균 불균형과 뇌기능과의 관계,"Based largely on results from preclinical studies, the concept of gut gut-brain interaction has been recognized, mediating bidirectional communication between the gut, its microbiome and the nervous system. Limited data obtained in humans suggests that alterations in these interactions may play a part in several brain gut disorders. Well characterized bidirectional communication channels, involving neural, endocrine and inflammatory mechanisms exist between the gut and the brain. Communication through these channels may be controlled by variations in the permeability of the intestinal wall and the blood brain barrier. Gut-brain interactions are programmed during the first 3 years of life, including the prenatal period, but can be modulated by diet, medications and stress throughout life. Based on correlational studies, alterations in these interactions have been implicated in the regulation of food intake, obesity and in irritable bowel syndrome, even though causality remains to be established.

The study showed that the correlation coefficient between scoliosis and plantar pressure index appeared as a positive value(p < 0.05). Idiopathic scoliosis patients with a spinal curvature of greater than 10° had a lower arch of the foot.
In conclusion, plantar pressure index should be useful in diagnosing and efficient treatment plan for scoliosis patients.",Seung Yong Park,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103524415
코어 근육 운동과 경추 교정이 신체 균형에 미치는 영향에 대한 비교,"The main purpose of this study was to measure balance ability, and it was intended to see how core muscle training leading to increased diaphragmatic pressure affects the human body s ability to balance. The Optojump system was used to collect the data which was statistically investigated. A total of 36 participants were recruited using random sampling from H university in Chungnam province. The participants were divided into three groups (exercise group, n=12, adjusting group, n=12 and control group, n=12) and measured pre-post Optojump test for balance ability. 12 participants (exercise group) conducted two kinds of core muscle training after the Optojump measurement and were remeasured after 5 minutes. 12 participants (adjusting group) received chiropracitic spinal adjustment after the Optojump measurement and were remeasured after 5minutes. 12 participant did not receive any treatments. For measure landing range, there was a significant difference on the experimental groups; before exercise (313.19±241.32) and after exercise (144.17±128.36), before spinal manipulation (412.49±255.19) and after spinal manipulation (170.41±85.98) (p<0.05). There was no significant difference in the control group. In the Delta % statistics study, the experimental groups showed a change of - 40.02% (exercise group) and - 28.75% (adjusting group) respectively. The control group showed the change of 47.11%. In conclusion, this study suggests that core muscle training leading to increased diaphragmatic pressure would help improving balance in the body.",Eun Hwan Choi,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103524339
계지탕(桂枝湯)의 기미(氣味) 표준화 연구(I),"This study was conducted to standardize the 'Ki-Mi' of Kye-Ji Tang in the basis of ${\ulcorner}$Treatise on Febrile Diseases${\lrcorner}$ and the results were as follows 1. The medicinal plants used are processed with hot water right after picking. 2. One seung(升) of water equals to 10cc. 3. One yang(兩) equals to 6 grams. 4. Medicinal plants are shattered to the size of beans by the process called Boo-Jeor. 5. Kye-Ji Tang, which is composed with 5 medicinal plant(Cortex Cinnamomi : 18g; Radix Paeoniae : 18g; Radix Glycyrrhizae : 12g; Rhizoma Zingiberis : 18g; Fructus Ziziphi Jujubae : 18g), is prepared by adding 490cc water to above 5 medicinal plants and boiled to 210cc. After boiling, the residue is discarded and the extract is taken orally 3 times a day as one dosage of 70cc. It is recommended that 20 minitues after taking of Kye-Ji Tang, the additional uptake of rice porridge might enhance the pharmacological effect of Kye-Ji Tang.",김인낙,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101705277
