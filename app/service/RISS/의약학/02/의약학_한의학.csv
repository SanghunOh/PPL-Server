1. In Huangdineijing(üÜğ¨Ò®Ìè), the connection of bonshu(ÜââÃ) flows and jingmak(ÌèØæ)'s can be compared to that of the earth's surface water flows and subterranean's.
Bonshu(ÜââÃ) exists on qi flows which is formed in consquence of running over of twelve jingqi(ÌèÑ¨) and fifteenth luoqi(Õ©Ñ¨) in four extremities.
2. While jingluo(ÌèÕ©) is composed of twelve mai(Øæ), bonshu(ÜââÃ) is composed of eleven mai(Øæ), it is beause xin(ãı) has no disease and also has no bonshu(ÜââÃ).
Bonshu(ÜââÃ) is used to treat disease of viscera and entrails, and frequently used in autumn and winter, also used when the outer layer or the inner layer of human body is become a fighting area of zhengxie(ïáŞ÷).
Physiologically, jingmai(ÌèØæ) nourishes the whole body and it's acting is prospered in four extremities. Bonsu(ÜââÃ) flows is just described as the process of gathering and storing the fruits of jingmai(ÌèØæ)'s acting.
3. In wuxing(çéú¼) attachment of bonshu(ÜââÃ), from a ti(ô÷) point of view, jing(ïÌ) xing(ç´) shu(êä) jing(Ìè) he(ùê) is oderly attached to shui(â©) mu(ÙÊ) huo(ûı) tu(÷Ï) jin(Ğİ), and from a yong(éÄ) point of view, which is divided into two, bonshu(ÜââÃ) of yang(åÕ) area is oderly attached to jin(Ğİ) shui(â©) mu(ÙÊ) huo(ûı) tu(÷Ï), while bonshu(ÜââÃ) of yin(ëä) area is oderly attached to mu(ÙÊ) huo(ûı) tu(÷Ï) jin(Ğİ) shui(â©).
4. Huangfu mi(üÕÜË ÚÍ) had stated the bonshu(ÜââÃ) of xin(ãı) in Jiayijing(Ë£ëàÌè) his writings, and therefore have faded the meaning of the concept of Huangdineijing(üÜğ¨Ò®Ìè)'s ""only xin(ãı) has no bonshu(ÜââÃ)"".
Hua Shou(Íè áø) had stated bonshu(ÜââÃ) in oder of jingmai(ÌèØæ) flows in his writings, Shisijingfahui(ä¨ŞÌÌèÛ¡ıÆ) and therefore completely have faded the meaning of Huangdineijing(üÜğ¨Ò®Ìè)'s bonshu(ÜââÃ).",ì°é»Ûô,1992,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19724997

Methods Mice were randomly divided into 4 groups (normal, control, positive control and DG 300 mg/kg-treated group). In order to investigate the effects of DG on gene expressions in experimental animals with fracture, we measured the levels of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), Sox9, collagen type ¥± alpha 1 chain (Col2a1), runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), osterix genes. After the cytotoxicity test, we analyzed the levels of expression of osteocalcin and Runx2, and tumor necrosis factor-¥á (TNF-¥á), a pro-inflammatory cytokine. The process of fusion in the fracture was also investigated by gross examination.
Results Through in vivo BMP2, COX2 gene expression significantly decreased. Sox9 significantly increased. Col2a1, Runx2, osterix gene expression also increased as well, but there was no statistical significance. The degree of unilateral fracture fusion investigated by gross examination was significantly faster than those of the other groups. Through in vitro the level of TNF-¥á in macrophages was increased by DG in a dose-dependent mannerand and 250 and 500 ¥ìg/mL showed statistical significance.

Especially, MF caused the accumulation of sub-G1 DNA contents of cell cycle and increased annexin V-positive apoptotic bodies and DNA fragmentation. MF down-regulated several proliferative (Cyclin D1) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, IAP-1/2, and survivin)gene products in these cells. Hence, MF induced apoptosis through the caspase-3 activation in DU145 cells. We further confirmed that caspase-3 plays an importance role in MF-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells by using caspase-3 inhibitor.

Methods: We performed 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical and 2,2-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) cation scavenging assays, and determined total polyphenolic content to examine the anti-oxidant effects of CLRa and CLRh. We also evaluated the anti-oxidant effects of CLRa and CLRh against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced toxicity in PC12 cells using thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays. Next, to compare the anti-inflammatory effects of CLRa and CLRh against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in microglia BV2 cells, we measured nitric oxide (NO) assay and inducible nitrite synthase (iNOS) using Western blotting analysis. Results: CLRa showed higher activity in DPPH and ABTS assays and lower total polyphenolic contents compared with CLRh. In PC12 cells, CLRa and CLRh showed no difference in H2O2-induced cell toxicity and ROS overproduction. In BV2 cells, CLRa showed higher effect than CLRh in NO and iNOS production induced by LPS. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CLRa has higher radical scavenging activities and anti-inflammatory effect in BV2 cells comparing CLRh.
