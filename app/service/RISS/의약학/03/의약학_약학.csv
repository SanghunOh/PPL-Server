However, studies regarding intake of HCED in adolescents have been rarely implemented in Korea. The purpose of this study was to investigate HCED consumption patterns among adolescents and prevalence of adverse effects from HCED consumption and to compare them between middle and high school students. The self-reported questionnaire with 31 questions was used to evaluate HCED consumption patterns and adverse effects. Among 792 students, 455 who had drunken HCED were included in the analysis. Nine (4.0%) Middle School Students (MSSs) and 11 (4.8%) High School Students (HSSs) responded that they did not know HCED, and 188 (83.6%) MSSs and 221 (96.1%) HSSs had heard that HCED contains high amount of caffeine. Seventy-four (36.8%) MSSs drank their first HCEDs from curiosity and 63 (31.3%) MSSs to stay awake while studying. However, 134 (61.2%) HSSs consumed their first HCEDs to keep awake while studying, and 57 (26.0%) HSSs from curiosity. Twenty-eight (12.5%) MSSs and 46 (20.3%) HSSs had increase in heart rate, 52 (23.2%) MSSs and 83 (36.4%) HSSs insomnia, and 8 (3.6%) MSSs and 18 (7.9%) HSSs hand and facial tremor. As shown in this study, HCED consumption among adolescents in Korea was high. Thus, Korean government should continuously focus its efforts to educate not only children and adolescents but also their parents for HCEDs in order to increase parents’ awareness of HCEDs and conduct education regarding HCED intake at home above all.",양영모,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100314218
투약오류 예방 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis,"Background : Medication errors can cause delayed hospital days, increased health costs, and mortality for patients. According to the Korea Patient Safety reporting & learning system (KOPS) in Korea in 2019, 3,798 of 11,953 patient safety reports were related to medication error which are 31.8% of the total reports.
Methods : Team compromising of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, etc, used the Fish Bone Diagram to identify the root cause. The pay-off matrix was used to rank prioritizing strategy with less effort with greater improvement effect. The program was restructured into a lower risk program and the new program was analyzed and reviewed by the team.
Results : The Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) was modified, so physicians can enter more precise order entry, and the Pharmacy Drug Master (PDM) was modified to decrease preventable error. To prevent mistakes from occurring for verbal chemotherapy nurse orders, a new computer entry system was created. The ward number was placed uniformly on the same parts of inpatient drug labels, and made more recognizable. More information was printed on the repackaged drugs for pharmacists and nurses to use. The purpose of the study was to decrease the number of the reported medication error adverse effect by 10%. At the end of the study, 17 medication error adverse effect reports were recorded, which is a 19% decrease from 21 reports in the first investigation. The Medication Error Criticality Index decreased from 10,034 points to 5,812 points showing a 42.1% decrease.
Conclusion : A greater reduction of percentage was shown in some processes, but some process did not show any changes. RPNs tied to human resources showed less reduction, compared to other processes. The common denominator among physicians, pharmacists, and nurses is inaccurate communication. Systemic regular training should be required for physicians, pharmacists, and nurses to minimize preventable medication error and develop accurate communication skill.",송용선,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244822
아보카도 씨와 씨 껍질의 항산화 효과,"As the consumption of avocado fruits and avocado oils is steadily increasing, the amount of avocado seeds which are thrown away as by-products is also inceasing. Thus, the possibility of use of avocado seeds as natural preservatives was studied focused on the antioxidant effect. The extraction of avocado seeds and seed husks with 100% ethanol by maceration showed highest antioxidant activities and lowest IC50 values compared to 80% ethanol extract. Furthermore, 100% ethanol extract of avocado seeds and seed husks included significantly higher amount of polyphenols than 80% extract. However, total flavonoid content of 100% avocado seed extract was not signigicantly different from 80% seed extract, whereas that of 100% avocado seed husk extract was significantly higher than 80% seed husk extract. In case of acid values, heating of oil alone for 120 and 180 min significantly increased the acid values, whereas the treatment of oil with seed and seed husk extract signficantly decreased the acid values. These results suggest that antioxidant effects of avocado seeds and seed husks protected the oil against heat-induced acidification. Thus, avocado seeds and seed husks have a potential to be developed as an natural antioxidant and natural preservative which could be used commercially.",여지윤,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107335909
유방암 환자에서 수술 후 보조요법으로 투여한 Trastuzumab 정맥주사와 피하주사 제형의 안전성 비교,"Background : A subcutaneous trastuzumab formulation has been developed as an alternative to the intravenous formulation. Although the safety of the two formulations was similar, some adverse reactions such as surgical wound infection and infusion-related reaction were more common after subcutaneous injection in clinical studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of the two formulations in breast cancer patients.
Methods : From January 2014 to June 2018, electronic medical records of patients with stage I-III breast cancer who received trastuzumab as an adjuvant therapy were reviewed retrospectively. We evaluated the incidence rate and severity of adverse reactions between the intravenous injection group (group IV) and the subcutaneous injection group (group SC). We also analyzed patients switching from IV to SC, or vice versa.
Results : A total of 180 patients (108 patients in the IV group, 72 patients in the SC group) were evaluated. Adverse reactions occurred in 94 patients (87.0%) in the IV group and 62 patients (86.1%) in the SC group (p=0.858). There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity of most adverse reactions, except for infusion-related or injection site reactions, which was 16 patients (14.8%) in group IV versus 0 in group SC (p<0.001).
In the IV group, 19 patients switched to SC. The most common reasons for switch were preferences (six patients, 31.6%). On the other hand, there was no patient who switched from SC to IV.
Conclusion : The two injection formulation did not show significant difference in the frequency of adverse reactions, but injection-related reactions or injection site reactions occurred significantly in the IV group, unlike the pre-marketing study results. Considering the advantages of the SC formulation, such as preference, the SC formulation is an advantageous treatment alternative to the IV formulation.",금희영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244823
카페인 약리작용에 민감한 지원자와 둔감한 지원자 및 뚱뚱한 쥐와 마른 쥐에 대한 카페인 약물동태 비교,"To determine the reason of individual variation of the effect of caffeine. the absorption and the disposition of caffeine were studied in caffeine sensitive and caffeine nonsensitive volunteers. And also to study the effect of obesity on caffeine pharmacokinetics, the caffeine disposition in the obese rat and in the lean rat were investigated respectively. In result the caffeine sensitive group showed a longer terminal half-life of caffeine(7.35±0.71 hr:5.49±0.73 hr) and a larger AUC (55.42±9.09㎍·㎖^-1·hr:440.0±7.81㎍·㎖^-1·hr) than that of caffeine non-sensitive group without statistical significance. The obese rat showed a longer terminal half-life (3.47hr : 2.31hr) and a larger AUC(35.3㎍·㎖^-1·hr:26.97㎍·㎖^-1·hr) than that of the lean rat. But there was no correlation in the amount of daily caffeine consumption and obesity. In conculusion, we suggest that the individual variation of the effect of caffeine are being caused from the individual differances of caffeine susceptibility or tolerance rather than the differances of the genetic metabolic capacity or metabolic tolerance.",유정옥,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19590343
고온용융압출 기술을 적용한 난용성 약물의 가용화 및 용출시험에서의 계면활성제의 농도의 영향,"Solid dispersions (SDs) were manufactured by hot-melt extrusion (HME) technology to enhance the solubility of the poorly soluble drugs (fenofibrate, celecoxib and cilostazol). Soluplus and Kollidon VA64 were selected as polymers due to their thermoplastic and hydrophilic behaviors. The SDs with three types of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) were prepared using a twin-screw HME system, at three processing temperatures. To check drug release behaviors and solubility of poorly water-soluble drugs, a dissolution test was performed using the paddle method per the US Pharmacopeia Apparatus II. Distilled water with 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) was used as dissolution media. The extrudates containing fenofibrate and celecoxib showed enhanced drug release profiles compared to the APIs alone. However, in case of cilostazol, the extrudate had a lower dissolution rate than the API. To solve this phenomenon, the dissolution test was continuously performed by changing the amount of SLS. As a result, the drug release from the extrudate with cilostazol was higher than cilostazol alone in the dissolution media containing 0.1% SLS. Based on this result, the dissolution medium containing 0.1% SLS or less was considered as more suitable media than containing 0.5% SLS solution, which is mentioned in the cilostazol US Pharmacopeia (USP) monograph.",최성민(Sung-min Choi),2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106513571
제4차 산업혁명과 미래 약사 직능의 변화,"The fourth industrial revolution, with its characteristics of “hyper-connectivity”, “hyper-intelligence” and “automation”, is a hot topic worldwide. It will fundamentally change industry, economy, and business models through technological innovations, such as big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and 3D printing. In particular, the development of highly advanced information technology (IT) and AI is expected to replace human roles, thereby changing employment and occupation prospects in the future. Based on this, some predict that the profession of the pharmacist will soon disappear. To counter this, pharmacists’ attention and efforts are required to seek innovative transformations in their functions by responding sensitively and promptly to changes of the fourth industrial revolution. It is also necessary to recognize the new roles of pharmacists and to develop the competencies to perform them. The fourth industrial revolution is an inevitable change of the times. At this time, we should take comprehensive and open perspectives on how the future society will change economically, culturally, and socially, and use it as an opportunity to shape the new future of pharmacists.",김유경,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107184052

극소 저체중 신생아의 예제제 정맥영양수액 공급에 의한 임상적 효과 평가,"Background : Preterm infants including very low birth weight infants (VLBWIs) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWIs) have high rates of protein turnover and low nutrient reserves. Therefore, parenteral nutrition (PN) should be initiated within 24 hours after birth if it is anticipated that they will be unable to tolerate enteral feeding for more than 2 to 3 days. However, in our institution, in cases of babies born on holidays and weekends, it is difficult to supply individualized PN including amino acids. So we supply starter PN (SPN) every Saturday and holiday, for use in case of emergency. We intended to evaluate the clinical efficacy of SPN on short-term growth and nutritional supply, especially for preterm infants.
Methods : We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of preterm infants with a birth weight of less than 1,500 g who were born and admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of the Samsung Medical Center between March 2015 and May 2020. The patients were categorized into two groups according to whether they received SPN or not. We compared perinatal characteristics, nutrition supply, anthropometric measurements, and laboratory findings between the two groups.
Results : Of the 82 patients, 40 infants were in the SPN group. Gestational age (p<0.001) and one minute Apgar score (p<0.001), and calories supplied over the first two weeks were lower in the SPN group (p=0.014). However, the rate of weight gain was higher in the SPN group (p=0.007). Most laboratory test results were significantly different between the two groups.
Conclusion : SPN can improve the short-term growth of preterm infants. Lower gestational age seems to be the cause of relatively high values of laboratory test results including BUN and blood glucose as well as low caloric intake in the SPN group.",성지현,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107921117
의료용 마약류 유통 관리에 대한 고찰과 정책적 함의 : 유통자료 및 청구자료 분석을 중심으로,"Objectives: To suggest direction for improving policies by understanding current management of narcotics or psychotropic drugs and analyzing their distributions and usage. Method: We conducted a comparison analysis between health insurance claims and the amount supplied to health care institutions for narcotics or psychotropic drugs through health insurance claims data and drug distribution supply data from 2010 to 2012 collected from Korea Pharmaceutical Information Service Center (KPIS). Furthermore, we carried out literature investigation and online search to comprehend the current management of narcotics drugs in Korea. Results: The amount supplied to medical institutions for all drugs in 2012 was 19.4 trillion won, which increased from 19.5 trillion in 2011 by 0.54%. For narcotic drugs, the amount supplied was 318.4 billion won in 2011 and increased to 335.1 billion won by 5.3% in 2012, which exceeded the rate of increase for the amount supplied for all drugs. The proportion of amount claimed in the total amount supplied to medical institutions for all drugs was 60.5% in 2012, whereas the proportion of amount claimed for narcotic drugs was 55.6%, which showed that narcotic drugs were used relatively less within health insurance. Furthermore, management of the current domestic distribution supply data focuses on manufacturing and medical institution supply stages. Conclusion: Hereafter, the management of narcotics or psychotropic drugs needs to be improved by reinforcing active monitoring in optimal prescription and usage in patients by collecting and analyzing information on drug usage of patients.",유수연,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101735551
COVID-19 소아 환자의 임상 양상 및 실험실적 특징: 체계적문헌고찰 및 메타분석,"Background: Although the identification of clinical and laboratory features in pediatric COVID-19 patients is essential in establishing an appropriate treatment plan, a systematic review and meta-analysis on the topic has yet to be reported. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science to access clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as clinical outcomes of children with COVID-19 infection. A meta-analysis using random-effect model was performed to estimate pooled prevalence and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Among the 532 studies initially collected, 12 articles were finally included in the meta-analysis. Among the investigated 320 pediatric patients with COVID-19, fever (48.2%) and cough (39.3%) were the most common symptoms. Almost one third of patients (30.4%) were asymptomatic. In laboratory findings, only 11.4% of pediatric patients experienced lymphocytopenia. Increased inflammatory markers including c-reactive protein (18.6%) and procalcitonin (32.4%) were observed. Only a few patients needed mechanical ventilation and intensive care support, and only one death was reported. Conclusion: Pediatric patients with COVID-19 infection exhibited milder symptoms and more favorable outcomes compared to adults. However, considering the high rate of asymptomatic pediatric patients, close monitoring is required to prevent community infection in asymptomatic conditions and hidden disease progression.",윤하영,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107184059
심혈관계 중환자에서 Propacetamol과 Acetaminophen 주사제의 저혈압 발생 비교,"Background : Hypotension is a well known adverse effect of intravenous propacetamol and acetaminophen. Specially, it increases mortality, acute renal failure, and myocardial injury in intensive care units. However, there is limited data comparing hypotension incidences caused by intravenous propacetamol and acetaminophen. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidences and risk factors of propacetamol- and acetaminophen-associated hypotension.
Methods : From January 1, 2019 June 30, 2019, we retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of the heart intensive care unit (HICU) patients who received intravenous propacetamol or acetaminophen. Hypotension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) <90 mmHg, a SBP decrease >30 mmHg from the baseline, or a >15% decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) within two hours after the first administration. Also, we identified the risk factors of hypotension in the hypotension incidence group by comparing with the control group.
Results : We reviewed 98 patients on intravenous propacetmaol and 106 patients on intravenous acetaminophen. There was no significant difference in the hypotension incidence in both groups. However, the incidence of hypotension within one hour of administration was significantly higher in the propacetamol group (21.4%) than in the acetaminophen group (9.4%) (p=0.017). The risk factor analysis indicated that low albumin level (<3 g/dL) (OR: 2.847, 95% CI: 1.339-6.054, p=0.007) and high initial SBP (≥140 mmHg) (OR: 3.142, 95% CI: 1.304-7.574, p=0.011) highly correlated with hypotension incidence.
Conclusion : The critically ill patients may have a potential risk of hypotension when administered propacetamol or acetaminophen. Thus, in critically ill patients, we highly recommend caution when administering these medications as well as essential blood pressure (BP) monitoring. The patients with low albumin level or high initial SBP may increase the risk of hypotension. Thus, we strongly close BP monitoring in high risk group patients.",홍신영,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106880350
항우울제 복용과 폐렴으로 인한 입원 간의 상관관계,"Background : Pneumonia is one of the acute respiratory diseases leading to death in the elderly population, and the death rate from pneumonia is gradually increasing. However, there are not enough studies analyzing the impact of antidepressant use on the occurrence of pneumonia so far. Thus, the purpose of this study was to analyze if the use of antidepressants impacts hospitalization from pneumonia in patients older than 50.
Methods : This is a retrospective, case-control study of patients older than 50 admitted to Severance Hospital January 2018-December 2019. Afterwards, patients diagnosed with pneumonia were used as a case group and patients who were not diagnosed with pneumonia were used as a control group. The final target patient was selected by propensity score matching. Based on the index date of each patient, the recency, components, dose, and duration of antidepressant prescription for the previous a year were investigated.
Results : The use of antidepressants significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia (model 3: adjusted OR [aOR] 1.69, 95% CI 1.31-2.17). As a result of analysis by class of antidepressants, except for model 1, taking atypical antidepressant significantly increased the risk of hospitalization from pneumonia (model 2: aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.39; model 3: aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.31-2.17). Also, in all models, the group taking TCA significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia (model 3: aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.02-2.79).
Conclusion : The use of antidepressants significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia. The longer and more recent antidepressant use, the higher the risk of hospitalization for pneumonia. However, considering the limitations of this study, a long-term and prospective study is needed.",최하람,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244819

다발골수종 환자의 안전한 투약을 위한 약사의 환자교육 프로세스 개선방안,"Background : As medication errors can cause serious harm to patients, preventing and avoiding them is important. Recently, a series of medication errors associated with taking dexamethasone at the wrong frequency occurred in patients with multiple myeloma in St. Mary’s Hospital. To prevent medication errors, the pharmacy improved the overall process including medication preparation, labeling, patient education, and monitoring. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of these changes and the need for additional action.
Methods : The improvements included changing the educational materials, including labeling, and increasing the number of medication counseling sessions. Medication counseling was conducted three times. The first was before starting the medication, the second was 2~3 days after starting medication, and the third was at the end of the first cycle of treatment. Assessment of medication awareness (usage, drug information, 3 points each) and compliance (based on Morisky’s scale, 5 points) was done at each counseling session.
Results : The mean age of the study population was 60.8 years. The mean score of medication usage awareness at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sessions was significantly increased (2.13, 2.97, 2.97, respectively, p<0.001). The mean score of medication information awareness at the 2nd and 3rd sessions was 1.72 and 1.75, respectively (p=0.872). The medication compliance at the 2nd counseling was higher in the group with medication usage awareness scores of 3 (n=49) than in the group with scores of 2 (n=2; p<0.001).
Conclusion : Medication counseling could enhance the awareness of medication usage and the compliance. However, there was no significant difference in the awareness of medication information after repeated education. These results suggest that additional improvement in packaging and clear labeling could be more helpful than enhancing drug information education.",오미란,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107143093

mon symptoms such as tremor, insomnia, anxiety, and nervousness and rarely leading to serious adverse effects like seizure, acute mania, and stroke due to caffeine overdose. There have been little current studies regarding analysis of high-caffeine energy drink consumption and its adverse effects in Korea. This study was to examine high-caffeine consumption patterns, associated factors, and adverse effects based on responses from 231 college students in a University through survey. About 88.3% (n=204) of total respondents reported that they had energy drinks. College students mostly consumed energy drinks to keep awake (46%) when studying and to recover fatigue (27%). Approximately 44% respondents mainly reported pal- pitation (73.9%) and insomnia (72.8%) regarding adverse effect questionnaire. Current reports on the risk of recreational use, co-ingestion of alcohol and energy drink as well as energy drink consumption among children and adolescents are increasing, requiring further long-term research and awareness of these issues.",이지은,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100273715
의료용 마약류 진통제 처방자와 조제자의 마약류통합관리시스템 사용경험에 관한 질적 연구,"Background: With the increasing use of narcotic analgesics, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety has been operating the National Narcotics Information Management System (NIMS) since 2018 in Korea. Some studies are related to the narcotic analgesics use, but the evaluation studies of system, including NIMS users are insufficient. Objective: This study evaluated the NIMS enforcement process through in-depth interviews on the experience of using NIMS of doctors and pharmacists who prescribe or dispense opioid analgesics. Methods: Participants in this study were selected through purposeful sampling as three doctors and two pharmacists in the metropolitan area. The interviews were conducted from August 27 to October 19, 2022. Each interview was analyzed using a phenomenological method. Results: Six components of this study included “Doctors and pharmacists come across drug abusers”, “They respond individually to drug abusers”, “They use NIMS tailored to the needs of system managers”, “They are concerned about the role of NIMS in practice settings”, “They face challenges against drug abusers” and “They find a way to utilize the system to deal with drug abusers.” The interviews confirmed that doctors and pharmacists used NIMS little in their work, and they only reported data. Therefore, it might be difficult for doctors and pharmacists to take measures for the safe use of narcotic analgesics.
Conclusion: It is likely that adding data-feedback and medication-check function can reduce the abuse of narcotic analgesics. In the future, further studies on the evaluation of the empirical results of NIMS and review of systems in other countries will be required.",김진이,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108541070
"임신·수유부의 안전한 약물 사용에 대한 지식, 태도, 행동 및 교육 요구 분석: 설문지 기반 연구","Objective: There is a growing interest in the safe use of medications in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find ways to improve education about safe medication use by investigating the status of medication use of pregnant and breastfeeding women, and by evaluating their knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward safe medication use. Methods: In this study, a self-report questionnaire was conducted on pregnant or breastfeeding women in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province. The questionnaire consisted of the following four sections; 1) sociodemographic characteristics of participants, 2) experience of medication use, 3) experience of being educated on safe medication use, and 4) knowledge, attitudes, and practices about medication use during pregnancy/breastfeeding. Results: A total of 203 participants were included in the analysis. Of these, 38.4% reported to take prescription medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

주요우울장애 노인 환자의 항우울제 복약이행도 연구,"Objective: Adherence is an important component in the treatment of various diseases, and poor adherence to antidepressants in patients with major depressive disorder is common. Non-adherence can be more prevalent in elderly patients with multiple morbidity and polypharmacy, resulting in negative treatment outcomes. The purpose of this study was to analyze adherence to antidepressants in Korean elderly patients with major depressive disorder. Method: A retrospective study was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance claims database, and the subjects of this study were patients aged 65 or older who received at least one prescription of antidepressant monotherapy for the treatment of major depressive disorder between January 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Adherence was measured using the proportion of days covered at 6 months after the initial antidepressant prescription date.
Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with adherence. Results: A total of 416,766 patients were finally included in the study. Over half of patients were non-adherent (52.67%) to antidepressants. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, national health insurance or medical aid, taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and having comorbidities were significantly associated with greater rates of adherence in the study subjects. The highest adherence rate was observed in patients taking vortioxetine. Conclusion: There was a considerable rate of non-adherence in Korean elderly patients with major depressive disorder. Health care professionals should try to improve adherence in elderly patients with major depressive disorder.",이경주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108541074
Systematic Search and Qualitative Evaluation of Dietary Supplement Mobile Applications: Using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS),"Background: Mobile applications (apps) on dietary supplements can increase consumers’ access to information. However, it can lead to indiscriminate use of dietary supplements. This study aims to systematically review dietary supplement apps released in English and Korean and evaluate the quality of those apps. Methods: Through the app stores, apps on dietary supplements were systemically searched and examined. Two independent evaluators evaluated the apps and presented a mean score using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS). The correlation between MARS scores, user and evaluator ratings, and the number of secondary features of the apps were analyzed. Results:Of the 2,772 dietary supplement apps identified, 17 apps were included according to the selection criteria. The mean MARS score was 3.28 (standard deviation: 0.29) out of 5. Apps had higher scores in aesthetics and functionality dimensions, while engagement and information dimensions had lower scores. There was a positive correlation between the number of app downloads and information among MARS dimensions. The subjective evaluation also correlated with the information dimension. There was a positive correlation between the secondary features of the apps and MARS total score as well as the engagement dimension. Conclusion: The dietary supplement apps need to be managed at a higher level of quality to provide safe and reliable information to consumers. Especially, quality on information and engagement dimensions can be improved. Involvement of healthcare professionals in the app development, management with adequate referencing of information, and use of secondary features for enhanced user engagement can be helpful.",이현지,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108541073

한국 초·중·고·대학생들에서 약물정보습득의 방법 및 약물오남용의 위험성에 대한 평가,"Objective: This study aims to assess the following issues - acquisition level in terms of the information on frequently used drugs of youth, access paths for the information, actual status of the use of drugs frequently used by youth,
types of the used drugs, drug abuse among youth, and the consequent drawbacks. This study also takes aims at suggestion of correct role of pharmacists in consideration of drug abuse among youth. Methods: During the period from August 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012, a research design and a question development have been conducted. To the students of the schools that were randomly selected (elementary school's N=99, middle school's N=106, high school's N=115 and university's N=115), it was asked to complete given questionnaire from August 1, 2012 to August 31, 2012. During the period from Sep-tember 1, 2012 to October 30, 2012, the questionnaires were collected back and the analysis and evaluation of them were carried out. Results: Drugs known to the respondents were a total of 115 different medicines and most of the drugs belonged to over-the-counter drugs. The most well known drug was pain reliever and the second most familiar drug was wound ointment. Most of the respondents found the drugs through direct use and advertisement. In everyday life, more than half of the respondents were using over-the-counter drugs as well as health supplements. The most commonly used drug was analgesic drug. It was showed that the respondents also frequently used the drugs for improving their grades and appearances. It was shown that among the cases of drug use, there were also the cases of misuse and abuse of drugs for the respondents or people around them. Reliability of pharmacists was shown to be high and many students were also sat- isfied with the pharmacists' guidance for medication. Conclusion: Currently many students are using different kinds of drug in daily life, and there is a possibility that the risk of misuse and abuse of drugs will be increased. Those age groups can easily engage in bad habit of drug use. Thus, promotion on accurate drug information has to be strengthened, and phar- macists are required to conduct correct guidance for drug user's medication in terms of use amount, usage, interactions among different drugs, and potential risks.",김진식,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100273709
SPE 및 GC/MS에 의한 혈액중 스트리크닌의 분석법 개발 및 검출사례,"An analytical methodology based on solid-space extraction (SPE) with with Bond Elut Certify cartridge (Varian,
130 mg) has been developed for the qualification and quantitation of strychnine in blood. After the elution layer was evap-orated, the residue was reconstituted with methanol for GC/MS. Internal standard was used 10 mg/l dextromethorphan. Strychnine is a potent central nervous stimulant and convulsant, and an alkaloid found in seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica. It was used therapeutically to improve circulation and muscle tone in oral or intramuscular doses of 0.05~8 mg. The fatal dose of strychnine for humans is 50~100 mg. A man was found dead lying curled up the corner of the large room in a roof house after the fire fighter opened a locked door inside to put out the fire. The postmortem blood and gastric contents were analyzed for toxicological testing. Strychnine and brucine were detected using GC/MS first in gastric contents extracts. The contents of strychnine was 0.083 mg/l in heart blood, 0.088 mg/l in peripheral blood and 4.0 mg/kg in gastric contents, respectively. Method validation was carried out in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision (intraday, interday) in blood. The assay is linear over 0.05~10 mg/l (r 2

당뇨병 전단계에서 제2형 당뇨병으로의 전이에 고혈압 및 인슐린 저항성의 영향 분석,"BACKGROUNDS There are many people with prediabetes. As prediabetes is a strong risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes and an opportunity to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, it is important to identify prediabetes with high risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. The aim of this study is to examine whether hypertension or insulin resistance are valid transition factors to Type 2 Diabetes from prediabetes. METHODS 2265 middle-aged South Korean examinees with prediabetes in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Studies (KoGES) during the follow-up period of 10 years. RESULTS During 8.24 person- years, we identified 469 incident Type 2 Diabetes cases (21%). The incidence of Type 2 Diabetes increased with hypertension or insulin resistance with the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.595 (CI: 1.209-2.105) and 2.286 (1.761-2.968) respectively. Compared to those with hypertension (Adjusted HR, 1.342 [CI: 1.045-1.723]), those with hypertension and insulin resistance showed a larger HR (Adjusted HR, 2.593 [CI: 1.802-3.733]). CONCLUSION Middle-aged South Koreans with prediabetes who had hypertension or insulin resistance were especially high at risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes. Hypertension had an association with Type 2 Diabetes, whereas insulin resistance had a causal impact on East Asian populations to have Type 2 Diabetes.","정주원(Joo Won Jung), 조윤(Yoon Cho), 이한길(Hankil Lee), 한은아(Euna Han)",2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108612631
유전자 치료에서의 병원약사의 역할: 문헌고찰 연구,"Several gene therapies have market authorization in US FDA since 2017, and Zolgensma was approved in Korea and marketed under national health insurance program from 2022. Market approval of gene therapy drugs are expected to increase dramatically in the near future. Hospitals and pharmacists are required to prepare for the application of gene therapy because gene therapy is a high-tech biopharmaceutical that requires stringent standard operation procedure and has biological risks and high price. This study reviewed the existing literatures to understand the role of pharmacists in relation to gene therapy using pubmed, embase, and Korean literature database. A total of 7 literatures were selected in western society and there were no published articles in Korea. The roles of pharmacists are grouped into 16 categories. Important roles include control of viral shedding and seroconversion, prevention of immune responses, and pharmacovigilance and post-marketing surveillance. The active involvement of hospital pharmacists in the entire process of gene therapy would be essential factors for safe and effective treatment of patients.","이유민(Yum-Min Lee), 권진원(Jin-Won Kwon)",2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108612630
국내 대상포진 백신 도입이 대상포진 및 대상포진 후 신경통 발생에 미친 영향 분석,"OBJECTIVE Herpes zoster (HZ) is a disease accompanied by physical and mental pain along with symptoms such as skin rash. The number of HZ patients in Korea has been continuously increasing. HZ vaccines are available in Korea, and it is estimated that 22.19% of the population aged 50 or older have been vaccinated up until 2018. There is a need to evaluate the impact of the introduction of herpes zoster vaccines in Korea at a time when the national medical burden due to HZ is increasing. METHODS Using the 2010 to 2018 Health Insurance Review Assessment -National Patient Sample data, the prevention effect of HZ vaccines at the national level was evaluated by comparing the incidence of HZ and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and the hospitalization rate of HZ patients between before and after the introduction of HZ vaccine in Korea. RESULTS The degree of change of the observed value compared to the expected value of the HZ incidence was -12.10% in the age 50 or older group, and -9.72% in the age under 50 group. For the PHN incidence, it was - 35.63%, -36.98% respectively. For the inpatient rate, it was -18.26, -30.86% respectively. CONCLUSION If further analysis is conducted after a significant increase in the cumulative vaccination rate, the vaccine’s effectiveness will be clearer.","정재희(Jaehee Jung), 강혜영(Hye-Young Kang)",2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108612632

의약품이상사례보고시스템 데이터베이스를 이용한 피나스테리드의 약물유해반응 실마리 정보 탐색,"To investigate signals of adverse drug reactions of finasteride by using the Korea Adverse Events Reporting System (KAERS) database. This pharmacovigilance was based on the database of the drug-related adverse reactions reported spontaneously to the KAERS from 2013 to 2017. This study was conducted by disproportionality analysis. Data mining analysis was performed to detect signals of finasteride. The signal was defined by three criteria as proportional reporting ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and information component (IC). The signals of finasteride were compared with those of the other drugs; dutasteride (similar mechanism of action), minoxidil (different mechanism but similar indications for alopecia), silodosin (different mechanism but similar indications for BPH). It was examined whether the detected signals exist in drug labels in Korea. The total number of adverse eventdrug pairs was reported 2,665,429 from 2013 to 2017, of which 1,426 were associated with finasteride. The number of investigated signals of finasteride was 42. The signals that did not include in the drug label were 29 signals, including mouth dry, hypotension, dysuria etc. The signal of finasteride was similar to that of dutasteride and silodosin but was different to that of minoxidil.

서울아산병원 처방관리실 QI활동에 의한 처방오류 감소 및 업무개선 효과,"Since the separation of dispensary from medical practice has been affected from July 2000, AMC has operated the ""Prescription Consulting Unit""(PCU), which acts as a mediator among internal clinics, outside pharmacies and patients. The main services of PCU are outpatient prescriptions relating affairs such as correction errors or change, substitution, inspection of each prescriptions, or consultation with outside pharmacy, etc. We conducted this study to enhance the customer's satisfaction and AMC credit by reducing errors through analyzing high frequency prescription error types, finding better solutions and building better operation systems of PCU. We have classified the prescription errors as following 5 major categories; (1) Prescription contents error, (2) Insufficient information for prescription medications or mistake in inputting the prescription, (3) Double prescription (4) Errors related to insurance (5) Miscellaneous. We could draw some solution to decrease errors by Quality Improvement(QI) program from these classifications. The QI program was composed of (1) Notice the procedure for correction, refunding and reissue outside prescription(at July. 2003), (2) Information e-mail according to attending physicians and prescribes(July.2003), (3) Rounding outpatient' department for reporting the errors to nurses(September. 2003), (4) Weekly error report system, (5) Computer program restriction for frequent error medications(From May.2003 to September. 2003). We compared the error rate before executing this program with it after executing this program. The mean error rate from the execution of QI program increased for a while(0.16% vs. 0.18~0.22%), but from December 2003 the error rate decreased steadily and the mean value went to 0.08% from January 2004 to September 2004 and after applying the computer programed restriction for medicines such as HRT, weekly dosing, contraindicated to be divided or powdered, these kind of errors have disappeared. The reason for temporary increase in error rate at early stage was presumed that it took some time for practitioners to be familiar with the new system. Additional roundings and reviews also led to improvements. PCU based QI program allowed prescription errors to be effectively monitored and managed.

The transdermal flux of CP increased as the current density increased and the magnitude was nearly proportional to the applied current intensity. Similar results were obtained for the change in concentration of the donor solution. As the concentration increased, flux increased, and the total amount of CP transported revealed that CP permeation through skin is in good agreement with Nemst-Plank equation. Total amount of CP transported for 8 hours increased as the duration of current application increased.

프레드니솔론 시럽제 제제설계 및 안정성 연구,"Prednisolone (PD) has been used in various disease and as various doses according to disease or body weight in pediatrics. Young children (≤5 years) who cannot able to take the tablet is prescribed with pulves, but the taste of PD is so bitter that they are difficulty in taking this medicine. And it is difficult to take precise doses because of the unequalization of distribution, loss of drug when it is distibuted with pulves. So in this study, we developed PD syrups for easiness, exactness of distribution and evaluated the stability of prednisolone syrups.
First, we made an preliminary experiments to evaluate the effect of exipients on the stability. We added EDTA (disodium edetate) to PD solutions (0.05%) and observed the slight changes of the contents. As a result, EDTA has an effect of stabilization. Besides, after added 40% sucrose and preservatives to PD solutions (0.05%), mixed each 10% glycerin, sorbitol, xylitol, propylene glycol (PG), and preserved for 6 days at 55℃, we analyzed the contents and compared the rate constant (k) and half-life (t_(1/2)). Because solutions added PG, glycerin is more stable, we observed the stability of the different concentrations of these exipients and established the appropriate concentrations of these exipients. We kept PD solutions containing citric acid for 7 days at 55℃ and evaluated the effect of the concentration of the citric acid. As a result, there is no difference less than 0.5% citric acid concentrations.
Second, through this preliminary experiments we designed the preliminary formulations. To examine the stability of formulations which is containing alcohol and is not, formulations containing alcohol (RP1, RP2) and formulations not containing alcohol (RP3, RP4) were stored for 4 weeks at 30, 40, 60℃ and was measured by a stability-indicating HPLC.

So, we can conclude that loxoprofen-Na plasters, when applied on skin, will he a new type of drug for controlling the various local pain or inflammation.",채주병(Joo Byung Chae),1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3135669
항암치료 병용요법에 있어서 Exosome 기반 약물전달시스템의 적용,"Background : Although cancer chemotherapy has made great progress so far, monotherapy still has clear limitations. For example, it lacks therapeutic effect. Therefore, in cancer chemotherapy, combination therapy of several drugs is widely used as it shows better than outcomes better than monotherapy. However, it also has limitations. Thus, various attempts are being made to overcome these limitations.
Exosomes are nanoscale extracellular vesicles released from multiple cells. They are involved in regulating cell-to-cell communication. Exosome is a natural liposome with excellent biocompatibility. Thus, it can be loaded with various intracellular component or other materials. Drugs loaded into exosomes are more readily absorbed by cells, avoid drug resistance, and maintain half-lives. In addition, exosomes can be isolated from patients and loaded with drugs. This approach of drug delivery through exosomes shows low toxicity.
Conclusion : The use of exosome as a smart drug delivery system to overcome limitations of cancer chemotherapy so far is expected to be a turning point in achieving many improvements in terms of effectiveness and side effects of cancer chemotherapy and efficiency in clinical practice.",송영천,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108739326
간독성물질들이 아세트아미노펜의 대사와 배설에 미치는 영향,"This study characterized the effect of liver injury produced by hepatotoxicants on the biliary and urinary excretion of acetaminophen(AA) metabolites. Liver damage was produced in male S.-D. rats, 24 hr after dosing with carbon tetrachloride(CCl₄, 0.75 ml/kg, ip) or thioacetamide(TA, 200 ㎎/㎏, ip), or 16 hr after administration of cadmium chloride(CdCl₂, 3.9 ㎎/㎏, iv). Liver damage without renal injury was confirmed by measuring serum enzymes, creatinine and BUN levels as well as by histopathological examination. AA and its metabolites were measured for 3 hr by HPLC in rats injected iv with 1 mmol/kg of AA. The excreted amounts of AA-glucuronide into bile were reduced to 60∼70% of control rats by hepatotoxicants, but did not change urinary excretion of AA-glucuronide and AA-sulfate. Treatments with CCl₄, CdCl₂ and TA decreased the total (biliary plus urinary) excretion of thioethers of AA(30∼50% of control), suggesting that these toxicants decrease cytochrome P-450-mediated toxification of AA. However, treatments of CdCl₂ and TA markedly enhanced the excretion of AA-mercapturate into urine. Thus, CdCl₂ and TA not only influence the formation of AA-glutathione, but may also alter the excretory routes (i.e. bile and urine) for the elimination of AA-metabolite.",황세진,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3135272
