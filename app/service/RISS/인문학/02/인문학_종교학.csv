According to statistics, about 80% of the Koreans in Korea are against it, but still about 20% of the Korean population are in favor of it. This 20% of Koreans say that they would choose surrogacy in order to ensure they have a baby who inherits their own genes if they were otherwise incapable of pregnancy. About 43,000 babies were born through surrogacy in Korea in 2005. But there are so many ethical and legal issues related to surrogacy. Examples of these issues include the difficulty of judging parental rights, the danger of the destruction of kinship structure, exploitation of the right of the surrogate mother, acquisition of babies by way of monetary dealing, colonialization of the womb, production and destruction of embryos, eugenic tests of the embryos, and the production of designed babies. This article will focuss on analysing these issues and suggest ways to solve these problems.",김희수,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76525923
팔레스타인과 이스라엘의 분쟁에서 이슬람 원리주의 운동의 역할,"This study is designed to research on the role of Islamic Fundamentalism in the conflict between Palestine and Israel from the establishment of Israel in 1945 to the Agreement of Wye River. In Chapter I , the purpose of this study is presented with some explanation of Intifada, the Road Map of Peace Process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the possibilities of a peaceful settlement between Palestinians and Israelis. This study is deeply concerned with the establishment of the Palestinian independent state and the nature of Islamic Fundamentalism in Israel. In Chapter II, the theory of formation of Islamic Fundamentalism and its application is described. The theories of Marty, Appleby, John L. Esposito, Daniel Pipes, John Obert Vol], John Obert Vol], and Gilles Keppel are presented. Marty and Appleby presented crisis theory. John L. Esposito and Daniel Pipes presented success theory. John Obert Vol] and Gilles Keppel presented evolution theory. But it is almost impossible to adopt only one theory to explain Islamic Fundamentalism. So it is important to understand exactly on the various movements of Islamic Fundamentalism and to analyse the Islamic Fundamentalism on the basis of evolution theory. In Chapter III, the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its background is presented. The history of the Jews in Europe, the emergence of political Zionism, the Balfour declaration, the Mandate for Palestine, British Administration, the Jew's immigration, the Jewish community in the World War I and II and the birth of the State of Israel were described. In Chapter N, the activities of the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine are presented. The history of the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine, its process, the Intifada in 1987 and 1991, the internal competition and cooperation of the Islamic groups in Palestine, and their pragmatic attitude to establish the independent state of Palestine were mentioned.

In conclusion, it is said that the pragmatic line to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict peacefully is witnessed both in the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine and in Israel. The Arab-Israeli peace process will influence the development of the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine and Israel. The main trend in the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine and in Israel will be characterized by pragmatism. And the birth of the independent state of Palestine might result in the weakening of the radical Islamic movements in Palestine and Israel.",황병하,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45035476
팔레스타인 이슬람 저항운동단체 하마스,"Hamas, which is the acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya (the Islamic Resistance Movement) in Arabic, was born of the first intifada in the 1980s as a wing of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Palestine.
This study explores the formation process of Hamas, its ideology, objectives and strategies, and relates them with the Palestinian and Israeli peace process.
Hamas has expanded and strengthened its organizations and influences through its increasing control over the religious institutions of the waqf (religious endowments), the mosques, and educational and social organizations. Concerning Palestine, Hamas denies the Israel's right to exist in Palestine because it argues that the land of Palestine is an Islamic trust (waqf) and Jihad is a duty for Muslims to expel the Jewish regime out of the land. It, therefore, recognizes neither the Oslo Peace Process nor the ""Self-rule"" of the Palestinian Authority. Hamas, with other radical movements such as Islamic Jihad, has initiated the military and armed actions and terror attacks against Israel.

While Hamas has made great gains, becoming a major political force in Palestinian society, it has problems and challenges. It has benefited from being opposition and the failure of the PLO in the peaceful settlement with Israel. One of the most difficult but crucial problems is how to justify its denial of co-existence with Israel and bloody terror attacks against innocent civilians, and convince the Palestinian people and the world.",최영철,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45035449

J. S. Bach 마태수난곡의 작품 분석과 배청에 관한 연구,"The extraordinary composer, Bach is praised by many other composers. Beethoven said of Bach ""Nicht Bach aber Meer haben wir hier"", - we have here not a stream but an ocean (Bach means stream in German) and he also mentioned Bach was the ""father of all harmony"", for Max Reger, he was the ""beginning and the end of all music"", and for Claude Debussy he was simply ""the Good Lord of music."" Mozart said ""He is the father, and we are his children"". Many composers, writers praised Bach in this manner. Bach's art is surely omnipresent in the music life of today, accessible to everyone.
Born into a musical family, Bach received an education at schools in Eisenach, Ohrdruf, and Luneburg. Bach's first permanent positions were as organist in Arnstadt (1703-1707) and Miihlhausen (1707-1708). Bach was cantor at the St. Thomas Church and School, and Director of Music for Leipzig.
Bach lived in the Baroque period. At this time, the characteristics of music written and in this style are as follows: diatonic, polyphonic, figured bass, basso continuo, sudden dynamic change, long ornated melodic line, doctrine of Affections, etc. Bach wrote the St. Matthew Passion (BWV 244) which is regarded as one of the masterpieces of classical sacred music. Soprano aria, Aus Liebe will mein Heiland sterben (For love my Savior is now dying) in Matthew passion is an example that has representative musical characteristics of baroque era.
Matthew passion is for solo voices, double choir and double orchestra which make the music majestic, with libretto by Picander (Christian Friedrich Henrici).The recitatives are based on chapters 26 and 27 of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, present a narration of the passion story.
The intent of this study is to present a comparison of John passion and Matthew passion. It also explains the whole structure of Matthew passion like the orchestra role and choir role. This work mainly analyzes the expression things such as word painting technique, imitation to exaggerate the scene in the instrument, harmonization of voice and instrument solo part. perfect blending of solo and choir part though they have very contrastic musical characteristics.
Some figurative rhythmic uses that are related to the text can be found in this passion. For example, in alto recitative, 'Erbarrn es Gott! Hier steht der Heiland angebunden (0 gracious God! Behold, the Saviour standeth bound)', the accompaniment of strings and continuo conjures up a vivid picture of the chastisement by means of a sharp dotted rhythm.
A main characteristic of Bach's chorale settings which distinguishes them from other composers is the expressive harmonic coloring to emphasize particular words or special meaning. The harmonic accompaniment supports the vocal recitatives. When the text means such as 'death', 'pain', 'sorrow', 'fear', chromatic and dissonant chords are often used to express the words. Word painting occurs when the music directly reflects what is stated in the text. For example, the text mentions ""heaven,"" the music gets higher. The 13 chorales, placed at moments of greatest emotional tension such as the prophecy of resurrection, the arrest, the trial, and so on.
When Bach composed his St. Matthew Passion in 1927, praise was not the immediate reaction, but through Mendelssohn's recognition of Bach's genius and his efforts, Bach's works can be accessible to a wider public today and recognized as summits of musical expression.",김순덕,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82407319
십자군 전쟁에 대한 연구 -이슬람의 관점에서-,"The Crusades were a series of religiously-sanctioned military campaigns waged by much of Latin Christian Europe. The specific crusades to restore Christian control of the Holy Land were fought over a period of nearly 200 years, between 1095 and 1291. The Crusades were fought mainly against Muslims and political enemies of the popes. Crusaders took vows and were granted penance for past sins, often called an indulgence. The Crusades originally had the goal of recapturing Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Islamic rule. The Crusades had far-reaching political, economic, and social impacts, some of which have lasted into contemporary times. Because of internal conflicts among Christian kingdoms and political powers, some of the crusade expeditions were diverted from their original aim, such as the Fourth Crusade, which resulted in the sack of Christian Constantinople and the partition of the Byzantine Empire between Venice and the Crusaders. The Crusades had an enormous influence on the European Middle Ages. Although Europe had been exposed to Islamic culture for centuries through contacts in Iberian Peninsula and Sicily, much knowledge in areas such as science, medicine, and architecture was transferred from the Islamic to the western world during the crusade era. Along with trade, new scientific discoveries and inventions made their way east or west. Arab advances (including the development of algebra, optics, and refinement of engineering) made their way west and sped the course of advancement in European universities that led to the Renaissance in later centuries.",황의갑 ( Eui Gab Hwang ),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82698369
자살의 윤리적 문제,"Korea society’s suicide ratio is the top of OECD nations. This high suicide ratio reveals a fundamental problem of our society. The prime cause of suicide is a result of economic crisis and a radical change of the structure of our society since 1998. So our society filled with a shadow of death instead of life and hope. It is evident that our society prevails to have a trend to neglect-life. In this paper, I want to survey the prime cause of suicide and then to seek the solution and prevention of this suicide problem. Also I want to stress an importance of proper bio-culture and suggest establishing bio-culture. Individual causes of suicide are a shocking accident, conflict, a lose of hope, a feeling of helplessness, painful torture, extreme property ect. Also an irrational socio-structural contradiction results in suicide. Committing suicide is not only an individual issue but also society’s disaster and reveals failure of our society. Suicide brings social damage and collapse of the family because they destroy their life themselves. Some support suicide base on the right of ownership of their life and respect for autonomy and the final exit of pain. But we should consider that life is given as a gift and duty. We should take notice the priority of the principle of non-maleficence over respect for autonomy. Suicide damages themselves and badly affects their family and their community. So preventing suicide is the duty of a community and ethically moral. Above all, to prevent suicide from spreading the movement to respect life based on the dignity of life, and positive motivation for the meaning of life must precede and should recover real solidarity of communities. Also education of suicide prevention should go ahead and a suicide prevention system must be established. These are the main roles of church for suicide prevention. First, the church recovers solidarity by establishing a proper viewpoint. Second, the church and cares for the living family of the one who committed suicide. Third, the church respects alienated people and gives love and care to them. Forth, the church notices contradictions of our society and makes effort to seek diverse solutions for these problems by long-term perspectives.",이종원,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101028067
다문화 학생의 주호소 문제에 따른 통합치료기법의 필요성 연구: 사례연구를 중심으로,"We live in the era of a multicultural society. However Korea is not well prepared for the multicultural students in the school. They encounter various types of discriminations and prejudices in the school.
This research adopted case study methodology to analyze the multicultural students for their needs of integrative therapy in counseling field. To fulfil this project, the researcher used purposeful sampling method, and 11 cases were selected for the study. 8 male and 3 female students were chosen, and 5 elementary students, 6 middle school students were selected for the study. From the 11 multucultural students, 7 students were born in Korea, and 4 students were born in foreign countries.
The multicultural students had 4 major problems: maladjustment in the school(study/school life), family relationship problem(family trouble/step parents), personal relationship(school violence/bullying), emotional problem(depression/self- injury). They appealed the difficulties of Korean language and therefore they cannot catch up the level of study. They also had communication problems with school friends because of the language deficiency. They also had emotional problems such as depression and anxiety.
The researcher analyzed the counseling methods used for the students. Basic counseling skills such as sympathy, listening, acceptance were used for 8 cases. Educational activity counseling methods were used for 2 cases. Art therapy method(one of the integrative therapy) are used for only 1 case.
To the conclusion, counselors should use various counseling methods based on the theoretical backgrounds to support multicultural students. Psychoanalysis counseling, emotion coaching, behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, and REBT are good examples of the theoretical backgrounds. Art therapy, music therapy, psycho-drama therapy, and bibliotherapy should be also used for supporting multicultural students.",박미라,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106261124
율장에 나타난 생명과 환경에 대한 연구 - 사분율을 중심으로,"  The Vinaya Pitaka is a universal ethical rule oriented from common good of mankind as well as a guiding principle in the practicing of Buddhist ethics. This studies that the Vinaya Pitaka is the operational principle of sa？gha based on Buddhism and the actual proof of an effort to make harmony with a Buddhist community and general social relationship. In the view of dependent origination, life and environment is interdependently open to each other. Buddhist perspective on life focuses on ""how"" to be valuable rather than the ontological rule such as ""what"" it is. In the angle of dependent origination, life is co-existent, human being is equalized through the principle of non-self, and then, it practices mutual compassion based on those.<BR>  In this study, it examined a standpoint toward life and environment through the Vinaya Pitaka. According to the severe precept of the Fourfold Rules of Discipline(四分律), precept of non-killing human beings tells us that human should not be killed in any case and should not use any methods to myself and others with killing intention. If breaking this, the practitioner will be exiled from the Buddhist community. In addition, the application of nonviolence ranges from human being and animals to insects and it is an active practice of life reverence. Then, there is life in all natural environments so it prohibits to dig in the ground and to destroy vegetation. Also, it prohibits to do any violence, to see the army and to watch a war in the standpoint of active non-violence, therefore, it is against the power and structural violence to practice non-violence actively.<BR>  In the view of life reverence and practice of compassion in the Vinaya Pitaka, it examined the practice of precepts considering life and environment. First of all, it mentioned interpretation of the Vinaya Pitaka and modern practice of traditional Korean Buddhism in the aspect of modern application of Buddhist precepts. Then, it examined a vegetable diet culture in the view of practicing of life culture, living and harmonizing with all life. It suggested the start of mutual living and livelihood from violence and taking life through dissemination of a vegetable diet. Moreover, it required active opposition to a vicious circle of all violence and systemic violence and its culture structuralized, and active practice of life ethics. It looked into the social service system for structural practice of non-violation. It also suggested that for contradiction of a Left-home practitioner""s duty, observing the Buddhist commandment and a national obligation, and for open-minded social agreement accepting the minority""s opinion and practice of compassion. It could be the chance of an earnest agony for vivid practice of the Vinaya Pitaka giving vividness to life and environment and directing to true life through co-existence and harmony.

애착 외상을 가진 내담자의 정신화를 위한 통합적 심리치료,"I tried to find out how integrated psychotherapy based on relational psychoanalysis works in the mentalization process for attached trauma clients. Attachment trauma deprives the opportunity to develop subjective experience into representation through emotional coordination by parents thereby depriving the mentalization ability to reflect on the state of mind. However, the mentalization ability of clients can be acquired based on the mentalization ability of counselors. Counselors can transform the way in which ""something to know but not think"" is unconsciously represented in a relationship with clients thereby integrating the dissociated and split experiences of clients. In addition, cognitive therapy and mindfulness meditation techniques can be effective for immediate intervention to alleviate violent awakening and emotional responses caused by trauma. And counselors will stay together in the experiences of the pain of clients and be willing to give themselves to the object of the dynamic relational gestures of clients.",방희조,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107815936
삶의 마지막 치료에 대한 의학적 결정에서 나타나는 의료 윤리와 의료인의 역할,"The place where people meet the end of their lives is changing in medical institution and the incidence of medical decisions in relation to the terminal treatment is increasingly made by health care providers. According to bioethics that is required in health care providers, medical treatment in purpose of extending valuable life is considered undoubtedly necessary. However, the maintenance of unnecessary treatment in un-revivable patients is considered medically futile treatment that can arouse social and ethical problems. Also, termination of life-sustaining treatment in un-revivable patients leads to death of the patient, which can bring up problems related to death with dignity or euthanasias. In the actual medical field, it is not easy to make a terminal treatment decision as in to which extent is a patient un-revivable, and to which extent should the treatment be done. The consequence of the decision, ethical conflicts, and legal problems are even more complicated. Therefore, in this paper, we will look at objectives in terminal treatment and the structures in decision-making process for treatment plans, and inspect social status by looking into current trends and issues in termination of life-sustaining treatment. Also, we will analyze the Medical ethics and ethics in the Bible for the making of decisions in selecting patients in need for terminal treatment, and the role and limitation of Christian health care providers in making that decision. Conclusively, Christian health care providers should not rely on objective probability of revival or scientific knowledge, but treat the patient, that God has entrusted us, according to the Bible ethics. The patient should be treated not only physically but also spiritually, and effective communication method is needed with the patient’s family in order to be a professional who can provide all information needed for making the best decision in future treatment.",이상구,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101028066
독일 리트(Lied)와 프랑스 멜로디(Me´lodie)에 있어서의 시와 음악의 관계 연구,"German lied and French me´lodie have some of the similar properties of Art song such as the union of music and poem, the accompaniment expressing the feeling of poem, and the variety and beauty of me´lodies. However, distinguished from French me´lodie, German lied has the folk color. As it could be found in Schubert songs, the uniqueness of German lied is presented by the harmony between the music and words. The Harmony shows German nature of internal lyricism characterized by simple, enthusiastic but not sentimental. Sometimes it gives the feeling of loneliness but not the shout of despair. The ""clear expression"" of French me´lodie which usually expresses moods and impression more than shown emotion is a contrast to German lied which express metaphysics and slowly. German lied are subjective in music and poem, however, French me´lodie are objective and intelligent in music and poem through connection between perception and sense. Thus, French me´lodie does not have the deep relationship with the popular music(like folk songs) that the German lied has. Above all, German has strong accent and French has vowels of nasal and liaison. These differences between two languages are the biggest difference. Lied writers should be caution about the syllables which have accent or not. In French, there are not strong accent like German but it is more rhythmic and recitative in expression therefore it is important to me´lodie writer to make the singers feel free in liaison. There is no doubt that the recreation of emotional expression from German music and poetry is easier to be made than the recreation of intelligent and polished mood of poem, and temperate and deep sentiment from the French music and poetry.",조명희,2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76518463
