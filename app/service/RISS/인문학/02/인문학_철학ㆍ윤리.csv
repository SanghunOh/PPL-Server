We will see the conflicting attitudes between pro-enhancement group and anti-enhancement group toward human nature, natural luck, and gene transfer techniques. I will suggest three different strategies concerning natural luck, that is the strategy of diminishing, nullifying and liberating the effects of natural luck. In my effort to illuminate the sharply opposing attitudes between the proponents and critics of enhancement technologies, I want to make a small contribution toward helping us to understand the nature of genetic engineering.",강철,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60163025
인공임신중절의 윤리적 논쟁과 생명의 우선성,"The ethical debate on the artificial induced abortion arises between the right to life of the fetus and the autonomy of the woman' body This controversy is not easily concluded due to differences in positions. Recognizing maternal autonomy can undermine the value of the fetus's life. On the other hand, if the life of the fetus is prioritized, the maternal autonomy could be violated. As Korean society has been asked to recognize diversity, voices supporting the mother’s exercise of autonomy are growing, and controversy over induced abortion has heated up again.
This paper will examine the dignity of life, and the ethical debate of induced abortion. We will look into the importance of fetal life and respect for human dignity between maternal autonomy and the right to life of the fetus. This paper will examine the discussed ethical issues that arise between the values of good and rightness in the abortion process.
This paper will also discuss ‘reflective equilibrium’ that address universal value and individual and specific cases simultaneously, and ethical discussions between the value of life rights and the limited allowance of abortion.
Finally, This paper will discuss the difficulties of mothers who are worried about induced abortion, and present the ethics of care for them.",김광연,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107117690
안락사 사례로 보는 생명과 권리의 문제,"The purpose of this study was to summarize the errors in the understanding of strange death and the definitions of death with dignity and euthanasia in modern society.
First, the history of death and the era of strange death compared to a familiar death are described. The case of the Swiss euthanasia scene is studied, and the motivation and reality behind euthanasia, especially the problems affecting those who are left behind, are elucidated.
Through this, the arguments for and against are examined in the process of a harp confrontation between the right to life and the right to die. In an era when the theory of duty has less weight, there is a need to highlight the stories of people who are still agonizing over euthanasia in public debate.",양준석,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108727821
OTT 시대의 극장문화와 공간콘텐츠의 확장 가능성 연구 - 영화관을 중심으로 -,"Since the birth of the movie, the theater has been keeping audiences from various crises for more than 100 years. However, in 2020, the crisis of theaters around the world came back due to the Covid19, and the industry of OTT (Over The Top), which is easily accessible to anyone, is expanding during this period, threatening the existence of a space called theater. Theater officials are worried about how to overcome the “crisis of desperation” due to the new platform and how to attract audiences who stopped visiting theaters in the OTT period, and the theater company is looking for alternatives and ways to do this again. In this respect, the meaning of theater culture in the OTT period and how the theater space can be expanded were examined. To this end, we need to check the changes in the perception of traditional theater screening with OTT, what points can be expanded by applying new technologies to attract audiences, what examples of expansion of performing cultural contents meet on the theater screen, how to create a symbiotic relationship between OTT and theater, and the future of theater.",한달호,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108300284
인공적 의식과 AI로봇 예술가,"This paper examines the question of whether it can justify the difference between 'Human artist' and 'AI-robot Artist' from the perspective of art. Can art remain a unique area of human activity that AI robots can never surpass? What is the difference between a human artist and an AI-robot artist? What does it mean to be an AI-robot artist? Can AI-robot artists understand art? Regarding these problems, this paper argues that the possibility of the existence of AI-robot artists depends entirely on how they define art, and based on this, AI-robot artists can also become artists who engage in artistic activities. Just as there may be several definitions of morality, various definitions of art are possible, and thus AI-robot artists who understand art in such a limited sense are also possible. And although it is at a rudimentary level, the existence of Ai-Da, the first AI-robot artist in mankind, is an example of this.",김다솜,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108245042
현상학과 해석학의 방법론적 적용의 문제,"Recently, qualitative researching methodologies utilizing phenomenological and hermeneutical foundations have been a new trend in many fields of humanities and social sciences, especially when dealing with the uniqueness and the meanings of lived experience. Nevertheless, we find that in some occasions these applications of phenomenological and hermeneutical methodologies are based on the superficial understanding of phenomenological and hermeneutical notions. In this writing, I want to analyze the methodology used in Max van Manen's ""lived experience research"" - which is one of these methodologies - to show that there is a need for elaborating the phenomenological methodology and for expanding hermeneutics in the qualitative research of experience.
Lived experience researches try to approach the substance of experience through ""phenomenological epoch and reduction"" and ""essential intuition(Wesensanschauung),"" and they apply this methodology to the ""written text"" which contains the spoken experience. For the essential intuition of phenomenology from the ""written text"" to arrive at the substantial meanings and topics of the experience, it is necessary to take into consideration the position of ""expanded hermeneutics"" in which experience itself is already the result of symbolic signifying and interpretation of one's relation with the world and the others. The phenomenological epoch and reduction should be applied to both the collecting of the research materials and the researchers' descriptions. The interpretation process should include not only the lived experience and the spoken experience but also the activities before language and, furthermore, the preconceptions of the researchers and the pre-existing paradigms of thinking. This way, qualitative researches can attempt to grasp the individuality of experience beyond the limited quantitative researches and illuminate the meanings of individual and concrete experience that have been left out in the generalized explanations.",김애령,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99551849
장기이식 환자의 동의권에 관한 연구,"This paper was started as a curiosity in how the organ donor and the transplantee express their intentions during the process of a transplant operation involving organ donation. In searching for the regulation regarding one’s own consent and the consent of one’s family or the family of the deceased in organ donation, it was found that organs of people who aren’t dead can only be removed upon one’s own consent, according to Article 22 of “INTERNAL ORGANS, ETC. TRANSPLANT ACT.” As an exception, removal of organs from minors of 16 or above or bone marrow from minors of below 16 needs one’s own consent and the consent of the donor’s parents or legal representative. However, there was no specific regulation in “INTERNAL ORGANS, ETC. TRANSPLANT ACT” regarding the transpirable act of conflicting interest when a minor 16 or above donates his/her organ to the parents. Also, it was found that the adult guardianship system that was enforced since 2013 still does not has the content reviewed completely. Thus, I felt the need of revision in “INTERNAL ORGANS, ETC. TRANSPLANT ACT” and started studying in this field. It is most important to prioritize the patient’s voluntary consent regarding the right of consent of the organ donor and the transplantee in “INTERNAL ORGANS, ETC. TRANSPLANT ACT.” Although our cultural judgment such as social change and change in the family system can be an important standard, there is no significance in prior consent if one’s own intention is not respected and the opinion of the parents or family is customarily more valued than one’s unconstrained decision-making. An approval from a third person, institution, or preferentially from an ethics commission or religious organization as a family or ethical aspect can be a good way to solve these problems. Thus, the own intention of the donors of organs or others himself/herself must be respected above all. Decisions opposing one’s own intention should not be made according to the intentions of the family or family of the deceased not only if one made a consent when one is alive, but also if one declared a clear intention before death. The problem is when one did not declare his/her clear intention when alive. In such situation, one’s own opinion must be respected by inquiring his/her family or related people about one’s usual intention regarding organ donation. If one did not have a clear intention when alive, donation of organs or others must only be removed upon the consent of the family or family of the deceased.",문상혁,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100548460
어머니와 아버지의 양육특성이 만 2세 영아의 사회정서발달에 미치는 영향,"This study assessed the parenting characteristics of emotional expression, parenting efficacy, the father’s child-rearing involvement, and the mother’s parenting stress. The positive emotional expression of the mother and father had a positive correlation with some sub-areas of the social-emotional development of toddlers; however, negative emotional expression had no correlation at all. The mother’s parenting characteristics had a stronger influence on the children’s social-emotional development than the father’s, and exceptionally, in the case of the self-concept, the father’s parenting characteristics had a stronger influence. These results emphasize the need for discussion about the way parents express their negative emotions and the importance of the father’s role in toddlers’ development of their self-concepts.",백주희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108727819
생명의료윤리 관점에서 소아기호증 상습성폭력범에 대한 성충동 약물치료의 정당성 논의,"Recently, a law on drug treatment for sex drive against some sexual deviants was enacted. However, the enforcement conditions of this law still has legal controversies in relation to the target, treatment period, and approval by that person. Thus, this law needs revisions.
First of all, it should be restricted to pedophilia who can see results of the treatment, and the treatment period should be edited to “until full recovery.” By doing this, sex drive drug treatment will obtain more persuasive force as a security measure.
However, there is some limitations in justification by law. Thus, I aim at revealing the feasibility of the execution of sex drive drug treatment based on wholesome paternalism and recovery of human dignity as a forced treatment from a bio-ethical perspective.",차승현,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60163036
게임은 예술인가? : 게임 예술 논쟁의 현재와 미래,"The question of whether computer games can be considered art has been ongoing debate. Rather than focusing solely on the conclusions themselves, this paper aims to analyze the justifications behind these conclusions. By critically reconstructing the discourse surrounding the art status of computer games, this paper approaches the question in a more productive way.
I argue that the debate on game art can be divided into two distinct generations, each characterized by changes in the central issue. The first generation primarily focus on illuminating the similarities or differences between computer games and traditional art forms. Conversely, the second generation centers around the question whether computer games can be considered art in their own right, as games. With regard to this second generation debate, I contend that the unique feature of computer games, which is virtuality, contributes to justifying their art status.
Finally, this paper highlights the existence of a more fundamental question implied by the question ""Is computer game art?""―namely, the issue of the value of computer games. This suggests the emergence of a potential third generation in the game art debate, which would explore the question of whether computer games are valuable beyond their artistic classification.",이다민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108650348
한국어 교육에서의 외국어 교수법 활용 방안,"Korean Language teachers who can speak foreign languages fluently can not always teach Korean as a foreign language successfully. It is better to speak foreign languages fluently. Language teachers have to be experts in everything. Mose of all they have to know about teaching methodologies and develope new ones.
In Korean Language Education most programs have persisted one or two teaching methods is the best. And in fact they emphasize grammar of pattern practice more than communicative practice.
There is no best foreign language teaching method. And there is no perfect method. Every method has good things and had thing. Historically foreign language methods in Western countries have been developed with the past experiences newly. And they are progressive.
In teaching Korean Language as a foreign language, teachers have to know about the merits of each method and use it practically and properly. For one student one method can be the best, and for another student another one can so. And also it depends on levels of students.
Therefore this thesis targets foreign teaching methods can be applied usefully and practically in teaching Korean as a foreign language. For this five teaching methods are selected, that is 'Grammar Translation Method' and 'Audiolingual Method', 'Cognitive Approach', 'Communicative Approach', 'Total Physical Response'. And especially in Communicative Approach five main Communicative Activities are uttered. That is Communicative Activities with non-verbal material(pictures, maps, graphs...etc.) and Information Gap Activities. Role Play, Solving-Problem Activities. Other various activities. Each method and activity has Korean examples. So it is helpful to understand how to teach Korean effectively and get ideas in develope Korean materials. And it is expected this thesis could be basic for better teaching Korean methods developing.",박미경,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19585446
