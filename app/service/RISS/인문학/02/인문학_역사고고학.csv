King Hyejong died without selecting a successor. During his short reign, it was continued attempting assassination against Hyejong and the threat to the throne. Jeongjong was the most threatening to King Hyejong and the most powerful force having the eye on the throne that time. Jeongjong was got of the installation of the King from the Later Jin Dynasty instead of King Hyejong, but he did not announce the death of King Hyejong and the enthronement of himself. It is probable that he took Wang Gyu as the political scapegoat to make a justification for his ascending to the throne and removed him.
First, it is hard to find a reasonable motive for Wang Gyu to have to assassinate King Hyejong. Second, before King Hyejong's death, Jeongjong took already control of the central political system and the military forces, and eliminated all the aides of King Hyejong by attracting Wang Sik-ryum's forces. Third, Jeongjong tried to overcome the repulsive group against him and the burden of his injustiful ascending to the throne, by transferring the capital of the country to Seogyeong. The relatively weak kingship of Haejong could have been easily exposed to the threat of Jeongjong who had the strong Hojok as background at any time. Abnormal succession to the throne of Jeongjong was already implicit in the possibility of a power struggle in the Hojok coalition government based on the marriage policy of Taejo.",임영희,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106340024
한중 역사 갈등의 현황과 과제 - 동북공정을 넘어 미래로,"In recent Chinese studies of Korean history, an in-depth study of the history of Koguryo is being conducted. Reports on the excavation of the ruins of Koguryo and Balhae and thesis on Gojoseon and Buyeo increased. Interest in Gaya, Baekje, and Silla is increasing, and research in the Koryo and Joseon dynasties is rapidly increasing. All pre-modern relations between Korea and China are organized into sect relations(宗藩關係). In addition, a large-scale publication project that summarizes the history of Manchuria is underway. The conflict between Korea and China caused by the Northeast Project spread to the cultural aid debate. China’s patriotic tendencies intensified. In China, history is used as a national policy to solve domestic and foreign political realities. If the tourism industry in Koguryo·Balhae and Mt. Baekdu becomes active, interest in local history will increase, and historical and cultural disputes and conflicts between Korea and China will intensify.
To respond to this, we must compile a history of Korean history that comprehensively and systematically organizes the temporal and spatial scope and flow of Korean history, along with in-depth research on Korean history, nurturing young researchers, and domestic and foreign education and publicity. A historical theory suitable for Korean history should also be developed. It is necessary to systematically organize the history of the northern region from the perspective of Korean history. In order to protect historical sovereignty while promoting historical reconciliation and joint development, the Korea-China Joint History Research Committee should be established as a historical dialogue organization between Korea and China. Efforts should be made to produce joint history books and textbooks between Korea and China, and to provide joint history education.",김현숙,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108285509

고등학교 역사과 서술형 · 논술형 평가의 특징과 개선 방안,"It has been announced that the Essay test introduced to the high school curriculum in 2005 will be expanded in 2007 and the percentage of it will be increased to 50%. As the test has played an influential role in assessment, this paper deals with three points of the Essay test, focusing on History section. First, the background where the Essay test came to be implemented and its significance in the school education will be discussed. Second, the problems and limitations to this test will be investigated through a case study. Finally, the ways of developing the teaching-learning method and assessment items will be suggested.
The Essay test was introduced as a tool which is likely to change the current student's learning attitude as well as teaching-learning method, and can eventually achieve the goal of fostering academic strength. But, in fact, various barriers in the way of administering the test have caused disruptions to most schools. So, well-organized and effective Essay test forms should be developed, assessing the historical and creative thinking of the students.

디지털 기술을 활용한 박물관 교육 발전 방안 연구,"The aim of this study is to seek for the development measures of educational programs in museums utilizing digital technology by examining case studies that introduced digital technology; the outcomes of the precedent studies that have intended to work out the appropriate methods for further application and development directions; the educational programs of Gyeongju National Museum to introduce digital technology; and the cases of the exhibition contents of the Children's Museum. Through this review, the strengths of the museum educational programs utilizing digital technology were summarized as follows: by inspiring the curiosity of participants who are familiar with the smart environment it was possible for them to engage selfinitiated learning; without any restrictions on space, steady communication was possible; and various outcomes can be produced depending on the choices of the users. It was also identified that the satisfaction level is higher when the analogue and digital are properly interconnected, their interaction is possible, and various senses are made use of. However, depending on the level of skill on how to use smart devices, the outcomes displayed distinct differences. Also, there were technical and economic limitations according to the arrangement of the internet environment including Wi-Fi and the development of software and the establishment of hardware. By reviewing the analyzed cases, this study was able to discover the development direction for the education program of museums: where digital devices are utilized as the learning tools for participants for their self-initiated learning and where the advantage of the interaction of digital media is made best use of by preparing for measures to improve the sensibility and expression ability of participants through the proper integration of digital and analogue, thus enabling education programs that have adopted digital in museums to be more enriched. In the future, museums will place greater emphasis on social educational institutions that can produce new knowledge by combining the previous knowledge based on people's knowledge. Digital technology can be used as excellent tools to foster such roles of museums. By accumulating experiences and verifying them in the academic system through various case studies and analyses, we shall continue to make every effort to minimize the adverse effects of digital technology and maximize the positive effects thereof.",정민영,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106969956
홍범도의 러시아 적군 활동과 자유시사변,"The purpose of this article is to reveal the relationship between Hong Bumdo and the Russian Red Army after the Russian Revolution of 1917. In addition, I would like to clarify the role of Hong Bumdo during the Chayu-si Incident.
Hong Bumdo participated in the Korean Socialist Party organized in Khabarovsk in 1918. From this point he began to establish relations with the Russian Red Army. In 1919, he went to North Gando for the unification of Korean independent military units. After the victory of Bongo-dong Battle and the Cheongsan-ri Battle, he led his forces to the Chayu-si of Siberia. It was to organize the large Korean independent army corps by integrating army units of Gando and the Russian Maritime provinces.
The plan to integrate the armed forces did not go smoothly. Conflicts have arisen over the initiative of integration between the Korea Voluntary Army and the Koryo Revolutionary Army. In the end, there was the Chayu-si Incident called ""the greatest tragedy of our independence movement."" Hong Bumdo, who was originally a member of the Korea Voluntary Army, led the troops that had moved from Gando to the Koryo Revolutionary Army. It was because he recognized the Koryo Revolutionary Army as the subject of integration.
After the Chayu-si Incident, Hong Bumdo participated as a military court judge. It was to prevent soldiers from being injured through fair judgment in the trial. But because of this, he had to hear a lot of grudges from around him. Even he was terrorized. It was very unfortunate for Hong Bumdo.","윤상원(Yun, Sang-Won)",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103527633

In Chapter I , the purpose of this study is presented with some explanation of Intifada, the Road Map of Peace Process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the possibilities of a peaceful settlement between Palestinians and Israelis. This study is deeply concerned with the establishment of the Palestinian independent state and the nature of Islamic Fundamentalism in Israel. In Chapter II, the theory of formation of Islamic Fundamentalism and its application is described. The theories of Marty, Appleby, John L. Esposito, Daniel Pipes, John Obert Vol], John Obert Vol], and Gilles Keppel are presented. Marty and Appleby presented crisis theory. John L. Esposito and Daniel Pipes presented success theory. John Obert Vol] and Gilles Keppel presented evolution theory. But it is almost impossible to adopt only one theory to explain Islamic Fundamentalism. So it is important to understand exactly on the various movements of Islamic Fundamentalism and to analyse the Islamic Fundamentalism on the basis of evolution theory. In Chapter III, the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its background is presented. The history of the Jews in Europe, the emergence of political Zionism, the Balfour declaration, the Mandate for Palestine, British Administration, the Jew's immigration, the Jewish community in the World War I and II and the birth of the State of Israel were described. In Chapter N, the activities of the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine are presented. The history of the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine, its process, the Intifada in 1987 and 1991, the internal competition and cooperation of the Islamic groups in Palestine, and their pragmatic attitude to establish the independent state of Palestine were mentioned.

In conclusion, it is said that the pragmatic line to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict peacefully is witnessed both in the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine and in Israel. The Arab-Israeli peace process will influence the development of the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine and Israel. The main trend in the Islamic Fundamentalism in Palestine and in Israel will be characterized by pragmatism.

한일 양국의 ‘임나일본부’를 바라보는 시각 변화 추이,"This article reviews research trend on ""Imnailbonbu,"" a critical issue of the history of ancient Korea and Japan relations. The general trend of earlier studies on ‘Imnailbonbu’ had taken the mythical contents of Nihonshoki(『日本書紀』), thereby understanding ""Imnailbonbu"" as ""the Japanese colonial institution in the southern parts of the Korean peninsula."" This view was synthesize by Suematsu Yasukazu(末松保和). According to him, ‘Imnailbonbu’ was a military outpost of the Yamato government in Japan and ruled over those regions with administrative and diplomatic functions.
After 1970, revisionists started to assert that Suematsu""s hypotheses―which were regarded as a kind of common view in the academic world of Japan―should be reconsidered and thus there has been a variety of approaches to ""Imnailbonbu."" Nevertheless, almost all studies still considered ""Imnailbonbu"" as the Japanese colonial institution.
Thanks to the active excavations of Gaya archeological sites since 1990s, it became possible to accumulate a considerable amounts of archeological materials and activate research on history of Gaya. This enabled us to broaden and deepen our understanding the ancient Korean history. In addition to this, the academic world of Korea started to interpret references on Gaya in Nihonshoki more critically, thereby presenting more advanced opinions on ""Imnailbonbu"" Therefore, ""Imnailbonbu"" has been understood as a consequence of international diplomacy between the southern areas of the Korean peninsula and Japan.
Recent studies on ‘Imnailbonbu’ can be summarized as follows. First, ""Imnailbonbu"" was defined as those who were responsible for diplomatic mission, considering the fact that the records related to ""Imnailbonbu"" were mostly concerned with diplomatic missions and that kun(訓; a way of pronunciation based on the meanings of a Kanji) of ‘bu(府)’ is ‘mikotomochi(ミコトモツチ),’ which means ‘an envoy(使臣).’ Second, the field of action of ‘Imnailbonbu’ was Allaguk(安羅國), which is known from the use of the word ""Allailbonbu."" Third, all uses of the word ""Imnailbonbu,"" except only one use of it in Yuryakuki(雄略紀), are concentrated in Kinmeiki(欽明紀), which means that the period when ""Imnailbonbu"" was working is counted as the first half of the 6th century.",이연심,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101793692
역사학에서 ‘동물로의 전환(Animal Turn)’ -짐승의 사회문화사에서 포스트휴머니즘 역사로-,"Animal studies have emerged and reached a maturity and acceptance level that could barely be imagined a few decades ago. There is no exception in the historiography. This review surveys recent historical writings on animals which will be established as a subfield of the discipline of history. Many books and articles on animal history have been written in the past several decades. The review shall focus on this main trends, themes and arguments, despite it being a daunting task.
The literature on animal history in recent years can be divided into two periods. The first one traces back to the 1980s, when historians began to study animals mainly in sociocultural perspectives terms. At the outset the political hot issues, such as the movement for animal protection, antivivisection, were dealt with. As the study on animals developed, the topics of animal history extended to zoos, petkeeping, slaughterhouse, city animals, etc. However, there has been criticism of the social and cultural histories owing to its anthropocentric methodologies.
The second period of the animal history began around the year 2000, when its paradigm changed. The posthumanist approach that animals should be treated as ‘historical’ actors, has permeated the research of the past. However, the problem of identifying traces of animal actions, lies in the fact that most of the archives have been written by humans. Posthumanist historians are making efforts to find other kinds of supplementary historical sources.
It is very difficult for scholars to historically represent the animal’s point of view. However, we should keep in mind that the animal history is following in the footsteps of the labor and the women history, which experienced hard times long ago, but has finally enriched the history.",송충기,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105989897
팔레스타인 이슬람 저항운동단체 하마스,"Hamas, which is the acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya (the Islamic Resistance Movement) in Arabic, was born of the first intifada in the 1980s as a wing of the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Palestine.
This study explores the formation process of Hamas, its ideology, objectives and strategies, and relates them with the Palestinian and Israeli peace process.
Hamas has expanded and strengthened its organizations and influences through its increasing control over the religious institutions of the waqf (religious endowments), the mosques, and educational and social organizations. Concerning Palestine, Hamas denies the Israel's right to exist in Palestine because it argues that the land of Palestine is an Islamic trust (waqf) and Jihad is a duty for Muslims to expel the Jewish regime out of the land. It, therefore, recognizes neither the Oslo Peace Process nor the ""Self-rule"" of the Palestinian Authority. Hamas, with other radical movements such as Islamic Jihad, has initiated the military and armed actions and terror attacks against Israel.

While Hamas has made great gains, becoming a major political force in Palestinian society, it has problems and challenges. It has benefited from being opposition and the failure of the PLO in the peaceful settlement with Israel. One of the most difficult but crucial problems is how to justify its denial of co-existence with Israel and bloody terror attacks against innocent civilians, and convince the Palestinian people and the world.",최영철,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45035449

문화의 다양성과 문화 충격,"The variety of culture and the culture shock
-Centering around the mission works in the different cultures-

Choi, Jae-hyun

As far as the concept of mission is concerned, it can be
said it is the great commission of our Lord Jesus. He asked
us to go to the all peoples to make them be the disciples. As
stated above, this mission is accomplished through God’s
calling on account of His motives of salvation. As a result,
missionaries are to be sent or be got together in this sacred
works. Therefore, it is needless to say the concept of mission
has to be defined from the point of preaching the gospel of
Kingdom of God and His salvation which is clarified in the
Bible. And of course this concept of mission is to be focused
on the coming Gods kingdom together with some other works
like awakening God's people and making church stand still
through preaching good news of salvation by Jesus Christ.
It is very important that gospel preachers or missionaries
cant help getting accustomed to the new cultures of the
mission field. Every culture in a nation has been cultivated
respectively in a peculiar way for a long time with its history
and tradition in the lives of the peoples. Therefore, we can
say that it is much easier for us to reach the target
effectively, if we know those cultures earlier, in case of the
mission works in the different cultures.
By the way, as stated in the main chapter of this thesis,
some obstacles like culture shock occur from time to time on
account that every culture has its relative difference being
caused by the variety of culture. As a result, it can be said
that the most important key to the mission works in the
different cultures is to overcome this culture shock in a very
new environment or culture.
One thing we have to bear it in mind here is that we can
digest their peculiar cultures without having some prejudice.
that is to say, not judging their cultures from our point of
view. Without being aware of this point, all our sacred
mission works which has to give confidence or open their
minds with love shall have the possibility of fail just under
the condition that we disregard or look down upon their
peculiar cultures with judging them as undeveloped or less
advanced one with no try to understand them. Mission
works, yes! That is the very works which are really wanted
by our God Almighty. Therefore, its way of approaching also
must be acquired through the wisdom of God. It is said
theology is beautiful, but mission is beautiful further more
just on that account.",최재현,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693259
‘동북공정’ 전후 중국 역사교과서의 한국사 인식과 서술 변화에 대한 검토,"Twenty years have passed since China officially implemented the “Northeast Project.” This study revisits the correlations between the Northeast Project and Chinese history textbooks, the changes in the description and perception of Korean history in the textbooks after the Northeast Project, their impact and implications on Korea-China relations.
According to “Changes in the description of Koguryo in Chinese history textbooks,” written by Ma Dazheng who led the Northeast Project, the revision of history textbook was presupposed and prepared on a national scale since even before the official launch of the project.
This can serve as an important clue to reveal China’s intention to incorporating the historical perception of the “Northeast Project” into Chinese history textbooks.
This study, based upon such awareness, discusses the descriptions about Gojoseon, Koguryo, Balhae, modern Korea-China relations, and the Korean War.
This article also touches upon the changes in the description of the “Great Wall” which has the same context as the project’s historical perception, although it is not part of the agenda of the Northeast Project. Furthermore, some descriptions of Goryeo and Joseon have also been included in the scope of this study in order to discuss the premodern and modern history diachronically.
The “unified multi-ethnic nation theory,” which is the key of the “Northeast Project” was applied to China’s history education, starting from the curriculum of 1980 to abbreviate the description of Koguryo and omit Sui and Tang’s war against Koguryo. Balhae history was incorporated into Chinese history even earlier, starting from the 1963 curriculum. The Chinese curriculum in the 1980 educational program began stating that Balhae had been a local government located within the border of China. The historical perception of the Northeast Project can also be observed in the description of Gojoseon. The history textbooks see the Han period when the Four Commanderies of Han were installed as the key period to describe Gojoseon from the Chinese point of view. The textbooks emphasize that Wiman Joseon was founded while many Chinese people were seeking asylum from the political turmoil during the Warring States, Jin and Han periods.
The description of the Imjin War stresses the relationship between Joseon and China, represented by the idiom, “without the lips, the teeth feel the cold.” When it comes to the modern history, many textbooks do not mention Article 1 of the Shimonoseki Treaty which stipulates the independence of Joseon as part of their description about the Sino- Japanese War. Attention should be paid to the fact that the textbooks reflect China’s historical perception regarding the subordinate relationship between the Korean Peninsula and China. In the same context, the textbooks justify China’s participation in the Korean War from China’s point of view by stating that the United States invaded the Korean Peninsula and started the Korean War, and North Korea requested China to enter the war.
Chinese history textbooks published in 1982 used the map of the Great Wall from the Ming Dynasty which marks the Amnok River as the eastern end of the Great Wall.
The descriptions of different historical issues between Korea and China show that Chinese history textbooks were already reflecting the historical perception of the Northeast Project even before its implementation.
As Korea-China relations were aggravated due to the controversies surrounding the Northeast Project, the descriptions about Koguryo in the Chinese textbooks have been abbreviated or removed to avoid conflict over sensitive issues in consideration of the oral agreement on five items regarding the distortion of Koguryo history. However, the historical perception of the Northeast Project still persists in the textbooks.
Descriptions of not only Koguryo but also the premodern history of Korea have mostly gone and the in...",우성민,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108399846
나이키(Nike)는 어떻게 아디다스(adidas)를 추월했나?,"Nike, a latecomer to athletic footwear industry, has contracted its footwear production out to manufacturers in developing countries who use cheap, qualified, and plentiful labor in developing countries. At first, Nike produced its footwear in Japan. In the mid-1970s, Nike transferred its production base to Korea and Taiwan. And from the late 1980s up to now, Nike has produced its footwear in Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. Based on this outsourcing, Nike has made the great revenue, and has invested a significant portion of its profit in research and development and design of footwear, technical innovation, advertisement, and marketing. In so doing, Nike released Cortez, Waffle-sole running shoes, Air Max 1(air-bag sole), Air Force 1, and Air Jordan. Nike has also paid great money to sports stars: Steve Prefontaine, Charles Barkley, and last but not least, Michael Jordan. And Nike has produced advertisements to attract consumers. It is how Nike has overcome adidas, the longest leader in the footwear industry.",임성윤 ( Lim Sungyun ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107816344
『한성신보』의 흥선대원군에 대한 인식과 평가,"Hansung Shinbo showed its understanding and view of Daewongun for three sections: firstly, 10 years of regent period by Daewongun, secondly, Gabo Reform period, the 3rd era of power, and finally when Daewongun appeared on the political circle around the time of assassination of Empress Myeongseong. It was resulted from media activity representing Japan, and meaningful that it had the same way of understanding with Japanese government. Hansung Shinbo regarded Daewongun as a stubborn seclusionist and recognized him as a conservative and obstinate politician. Japan used the term, ‘seclusionist’ through Hansung Shinbo to drive Daewongun to a stubborn and inflexible ‘seclusionist’ associating him with conservatism, exclusivity and retrogression of Joseon society. In the Gabo Reform era, Japan associated Daewongun with the image of being ‘fairness’ and ‘unselfish reformer’. Japan took advantage of Daewongun in the assassination of Empress Myeongseong by focusing on the fact that he stuck to the power even though he retired from the politics.
Consequently, they propagated Daewongun’s generosity, positive drive and ability to settle the situation and took advantage of his will to power but tried to block his actual intervention into the power.",장영숙,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107142444
흑사병 창궐과 잉글랜드의 사회·경제적 변화: 임금 인상에 대한 논의를 중심으로,"The Black Death, which reached England in 1348, caused the eradication of a third of population in England leading to significant social and economic changes. The size of workforce decreased and in turn the workers acquired opportunities to demand more wages and even relocate themselves for better compensation. For the employers, these circumstances resulted in loss of capital as well as infringing their grasp on the working class. In consideration of this historical context, this study illustrates the social and economic impacts of the pandemic, in particular, on wage disputes. To review the historical importance of wage disputes from an unconventional point of view, the analysis is made by utilizing the Postal Model to examine the direct correlation between England’s labor force market and dramatic population decline. This study thus broadens the contemporary understanding of social and economic impacts of Black Death on wage disputes in England.",이상동,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108076036
고종대 경복궁의 중건의 정치적 의미,"Gyeongboggung(景福宮) was the first official palace in Joseon(朝鮮) Dynasty. The palace was in fire with other palaces during the Japanese invasion to Joseon in 1592. While other palaces were rebuilt and used, Gyeongboggung remained as a vacant lot and later, the reconstruction was begun in April, 1865. Although the construction was suspended for a while due to the invasion of U.S. warships, it was completed in July, 1868 and the King, Gojong(高宗) moved there.
It was Heungseondaeweongun(興宣大院君), Yihaeung(李昰應) who played the most significant role in the reconstruction of Gyeongboggung. The Regent, Daeweongun put those close to himself in Yeonggeondogam(營建都監) which was the temporary government office, dealing with construction works and steamrollered his intension through this office. The other high-ranked government officials could not take charge of practical works in Yeonggeondogam, simply carrying out trivial matters. Yeonggeondogam took up a collection and expenditure of money that was necessary for the reconstruction of the palace. In addition to that, the office also dealt with the remodeling of other official buildings and took a hand in the public finance of the nation through this participation, It was a formal apparatus with which he could exercise his influence over the national administrations, mainly in finances and personnel managements, It was disorganized in September, 1872 when the trend of political situation abroad and home underwent a sudden change, including the intrusion of U.S. warships into Kanghwa(江華) Island in April, 1871.
He did not made a dazzling appearance in the foreground of the political scene. Moreover, with the disorganization of Yeonggeondogam, his political limitations are revealed and his influencing power became emaciated. Now, The King, Gojong made some attempts to exert his own sovereign power. The promotion of major constructions for national facilities and structures, including rebuilding Gyeongboggung, in the early reign of Gojong was a core base for The Regent, Daeweongun to seize and exercise a political power.",홍순민,2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75058970
강감찬과 귀주대첩,"The purpose of this study is to examine the process of Kang Gam-chan’s entry into politics and his role before and after the Great War at Guiju. The existing studies are only focused on his role as a Great Commander of the Great War at Guiju, and none of them deals with his life and political activity. There are, of course, a few papers dealing with the political character of Kang Gam-chan, but those are not enough to explain his political life and the Great War at Guiju correlatively.
Based on the awareness of this problem on current studies, Kang Gam-chan’s entry into politics will be examined in this paper. Kang Gam-chan entered into politics in his age of thirty six, through Poksi(覆試) in which he passed first on the list in 983, the second year of King Sung-jong’s reign. It seems that Sung-jong tried to reinforce royal authority by selecting Kang Gam-chan；unfortunately, it hardly worked. Kang’s activities are notable after the enthronement of Hyeon-jong, and his major political activities before the Great War at Guiju are as follows.
First, in the year Hyeon-jong ascended the throne, Kang Gam-chan proposed to build a Nasung(羅城) for protection from the north barbarian tribes. Secondly, Kang was Yebusirang(禮部侍郞) and played the role of Gygonger(知貢擧). When Hyeon-jong acceded to the throne, the political situation of Goryeo was out of joint. It is significant that Kang Gam-chan played the important role of selecting talented people in that fluid political situation. Thirdly, unlike other court officials, only Kang alone insisted on escaping from the palace and going southward in the Second Invasion of the Kitans therefore he protected the Royal Court. In that general crisis, Hyeon-jong followed Kang’s advices and this fact shows the relationship between the Emperor and Kang Gam-chan clearly. Fourthly, after the invasion of the Kitans, Kang Gam-chan contributed to establishment of the ruling order by building Sajikdan(社稷壇) and maintaining formalities as Jungchusa(中樞使). Fifthly, as Ibusanseo(吏部尙書) he distributed part of his land to soothe dissatisfaction of the soldiers in 1016, the seventh year of King Hyeon-jong’s reign.
In December 1018(the ninth year of King Hyeon-jong’s reign), during so-called ‘the Third Invasion of Kitan’ period, Kang Gam-chan led the war as Sangwonsoo(上元帥). It seems that Hyeon-jong had prepared the war through general Kang. That Hyeon-jong had prepared the war is clear based on the fact that he appointed Kang Gam-chan to Seogyoungyoosoo(西京留守) in May of the nineth year of his reign, and Seobukmyonhangyoungdotongsa(西北面行營都統使) in October respectively. When Hyeon-jong appointed general Kang to Seogyoungyoosoo, Hyeon-jong himself wrote a Gosin(告身) in which he wrote about Kang Gam-chan’s contributions. After this appointment, Kang was appointed to Seobukmyonhangyoungdotongsa which is responsible for protection of all Northwestern regions. These mean that Hyeon-jong prepared for the invasion of the Kitans through Kang Gam-chan, who is close to Hyeon-jong. Finally, Kang Gam-chan successfully defeated the Kitans in the Great War of Guiju.
Based on the internal background, the reasons of the Great Victory at Guiju are as follows：first, Hyeon-jong of Goryeo prepared well for the war through Kang Gam-chan who gained control of the military forces. Secondly, the officials of Goryeo agreed strong policies for the Kitans unlike the first and second invasion period. Thirdly, Kang Gam-chan’s strategic or tactical insight and manipulation of troops were the reasons of the Great Victory.
After ‘the Third Invasion of the Kitans’, the relationship between Goryeo and Kitan improved rapidly because both countries were tired of the long wars. Goryeo successfully protected themselves from the invasions of Kitan and the Kitans was promised Chinjo(親朝). Kang promoted continuously after the war. He, however, retired f...",김만호,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103968957
신라후기양식토기의 편년,"Developments in the chronological study of Silla pottery have resulted in the establishment of a relatively stable chronology for early Silla style pottery, and the chronological outline has also become clearer for late Silla style pottery. The aim of this paper is to formulate a chronological framework for the entire scope of late Silla style pottery based on a review of the research that has been accumulated up to the present day.
A four-phase relative chronology can be established for late Silla style pottery based on the emergence of new pottery types and developments in pottery form. Phases I and II were established based on ceramic material which came from burial contexts; diachronic change in pottery form was examined for each pottery type. As for Phases III and IV, diachronic change was identified for ceramic material which came from non-burial contexts as well, since burial evidence from these phases is sorely lacking.
During the early part of the 6th century CE, the mounts of Silla mounted bowls became shorter due to the influence of low-footed Chinese ceramics and metal Buddhist vessels, and a new ceramic type - the bowl with cover (hab) - emerged. These events represent the transition from early to late Silla style pottery.
Stamped decoration had yet to be used in Phase I so the covers of mounted bowls etc. were decorated with a row of incised triangle and dotted semi-circle motifs framed by a pair of parallel lines.
Phase II witnessed the use of stamped decorations consisting of individual motifs. In the late part of the 6th century CE, stamped decorations of a double circle motif were used. It is possible that this was influenced by a similar mode of decoration which, along with the lotus pattern, was applied to the ceramics that came from the Hongzhou Kiln (currently located in Jiangxi province, China) of the Southern Dynasties. As a result of this, triangle and various circle motifs were also translated into stamped decorations. Appearing next was the waterdrop motif which was mainly used in the early part of the 7th century CE. It is possible that this motif appeared as the result of the embossed lotus pattern which decorated the ceramics from the Hongzhou Kiln; in Silla pottery, the same motif was expressed in intaglio. Until Phase II, a single row of stamped motifs framed by a pair of parallel lines was used to decorate Silla pottery.
In Phase III, standardized bowls with covers came to be decorated with stamped patterns consisting of multiple double circle or double dotted semi-circle motifs which were spread out. From the late part of the 7th century CE, vertically continuous stamped motifs came to be used, forming continuous horseshoe patterns.
In Phase IV, from the late part of the 7th century to the mid 8th century CE, a new type of bowl with cover which had a outwardly curving rim emerged and came to join the previous type which had a straight rim. Vertically continuous stamped motifs were the most popular in this period and formed continuous horseshoe patterns, vertical dotted patterns, and vertical wave patterns. Stamping techniques utilized in making such patterns consisted of zigzag stamping and ‘ㅅ’stamping. From the mid 8th century CE, the use of stamped decorations began to wane and pottery surfaces began to be left plain.
The general position of the archaeological community until now has been to make a distinction between the above established Phases I~II and Phases III-IV, and to maintain that a stylistic transition occurred between the two. However, it can be argued that the difference between Phase II and Phase III derives, above all, from a difference in the context from which the ceramic material comes from (following the dramatic decrease in burial sites from Phase III) and that it need not be regarded as representing a‘ stylistic change’per se.",최병현,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104519308
『천변풍경』에 나타난 사회상과 작가의식,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the social characteristic and the consciousness of author by taking notice of city life in 1930's described in Park, Tae-Won's Chunbyun Pungkyung. In the work, the anomie of social structure arisen from Japaness colonial policy was demonstrated, which is found culturally in the destruction of moral value and economically in the reification of sex.
To grasp the consciousness of author toward the social situation, first of all I have examined implied author's psychic distance by classifing the character type and attempted the conscioussness of author toward the social regime by investigating the conflicting structure. On the basis of the consciousness of community and the norminative means, the character type was classified into conformist-type, ritualist-type, destructor-type, and innovator-type.
Being related with the character type, the psychic distance is near in case of conformist-type and innovator-type, but is far in that of ritualist-type and destructor-type. The conflicting structure in this work is divided into two parts. One is a confrontation between the observance the haves and have-nots.
In this work the former has been central while the latter has appeared faintly and symbolically, which is a reflection of the author's recognition toward the social system. The fact that complicated structure with conformity and moral value is strong while the economical conflict-structure with the conservativeness is weak is the reason why the author intends to find a solution to the social anomie is a permitted meaningful function.
Therefore, Chunbyun Pungkyung is composed of the unique structure, namely, a mosaic structure of a short-story, and attempts an experimental technique that moves a point of view variously. But judging from the situation of the times, this novel is a conformable to the regime and belongs to passive category from the viewpoint of describing the distorted cultural phenomena and the restoration of moral.",韓昌燁,1990,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2006752
백제의 對南朝 외교 전략과 遼西經略 기사,"Articles on Baekje’s Liaoxi governance so far have discussed from Baekje’s point of view, so there is a lack of review of the Southern dynasty’s political position or description intention who wrote the article. However, this should be discussed as a topic of diplomatic strategy among East Asian countries fiercely developed in the fifth century and mutual recognition, beyond the matter of historicity of Liaoxi governance.
There were voluntary tributes of neighboring countries during the Northern and Southern dynasties period due to the unusual circumstances. In a fierce diplomatic game, they displayed their royalty as one of vassal states and released exaggerated information to strengthen their stature strategically. Nevertheless, Southern dynasties since Song dynasty were collecting generally accurate information on surrounding situation under the military confrontation with Northern Wei. This is the reason why it is difficult to conclude that various false information spread by the vassal states to the Southern dynasties was to simply deceive them.
Given the circumstances, it is understood that the Southern dynasties were also aware of the authenticity of various information, including sending fake envoys(僞使) or writing false situations in the letters to the emperor sent by Goguryeo, Baekje, and Wa in the late fifth century. Southern dynasties showed magnanimous attitude towards symbolic tributes(fake envoys) of vassal states from afar or amicable requests for becoming a tributary. The southern dynasties pursued international authority centered on China and the stability of domestic regime by using strategic false information from the tributaries, and the diplomatic illusions created in a mutual cooperative relationship between the two countries remained in the history books as “truth”.
The diplomatic propaganda of neighboring countries spread in the fourth to sixth centuries should be approached from the viewpoint that it was not a one-sided deception against the governing states, but the result of mutual compromise considering the political will of both countries and a kind of practice in East Asian diplomacy at the time. Articles on Baekje’s Liaoxi governance can be understood in this context as being written in the historical records.",안정준,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108547893
