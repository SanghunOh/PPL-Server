This paper suggested to revitalizing the digitization of rare books and manuscripts through comparison and analysis of library search functions, catalogs and bibliographic information, and additional & shared services. The results are as follows. First, it proposed a search function, such as a separate interface for searching only rare books displaying the original images and icon, and providing specialized information on rare books such as donors in the search result list. Second, although there were many university libraries that provided images and commentaries of rare books, the ratio of DB construction to the amount of collections was very low at 6.8% for original images and less than 1% for original texts and commentaries. Therefore, a method to increase the DB construction rate, such as participation in national projects, was proposed. Third, The rate of external sharing of bibliographic information is about 20%, and the majority of libraries are unable to download the original images, so it was confirmed that they were passive about sharing data. Accordingly, it was proposed to actively share their information through the role of the university, a public organization and the characteristics of rare books & manuscripts in the public domain. Finally, it was proposed that general users can easily understand and access it. For this, it was recommended that each university library develops specialized contents of rare books, plans a digital collection with a multi-layered structure, and develops online exhibition contents.",임소정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639709

피렌체 르네상스와 메디치가 도서관 연구,"Florence is the cradle of the Italian Renaissance. It is the result of a combination of medieval humanists’ exploration of ancient Greek and Roman knowledge and culture, the leadership of great monarchs and priests, patronage of the Medici family, etc., free-thinking and creativity of artists, and critical consciousness and cultural needs of citizens. However, the Florentine Renaissance could not have blossomed unless the Medici family had collected ancient manuscripts and translations, and built libraries to preserve and provide literature. Based on this logical basis, this study outlined the Florentine renaissance and historic libraries, analyzed the collection and composition of favorite books of the Medici family, and traced the architectural characteristics and metaphors of the Medici libraries, The San Marco Library (Michelozzo Library), Library of Badia Fiesolana, and the San Lorenzo Library (Laurentian Library) were the priming and birthplace of the Florentine Renaissance despite of many difficulties, including earthquake, fire, restoration, transfer, seizure, and closure. In particular, the San Marco Library, which was opened in 1444 based on the financial support of Cosimo de’ Medici, Michelozzo’s design, and Niccoli’s private collections was the first common library in the Renaissance period. And the architectural highlight of the Laurentian Library, which opened in 1571 under the leadership of Giulio (Papa Clemente Ⅶ), is Michelangelo’s staircase, which symbolizes ‘from ignorance to wisdom’, and the real value of the content is the ancient manuscripts and early printed books, which were collected by the humanist Niccoli and the Medici family. In short, when discussing the Florentine Renaissance, Medici’s collection and historic libraries are very important points. The reason is that the ancient collections were not stuffed products, but syntactic semiotics, and the libraries are telescopes that view the history of human knowledge and culture and microscopes that create knowledge and wisdom. If records dominate memories, libraries accumulate records. Therefore, long breathing and time capsule strategies are also required for the development and preservation of retroactive books in domestic libraries with a relatively long history.",윤희윤,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108284801

Efforts to solve the problem through interactions between the young and the old have been made in various fields, but reading-related intergenerational activities are rare. A qualitative study was conducted to provide constructive suggestions by hosting a book club for the young and the old, carrying out individual interviews, and analyzing them. Participants in this study agreed that there were few opportunities for intergenerational exchanges. However, they found that reading-based intergenerational activities were mutually beneficial in the intergenerational book club. The participants hoped the number of such occasions would increase. The study resulted in a few implications for intergenerational book clubs, which should help vitalize the book clubs and accentuate the benefits of social reading.",김지영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530774
Kano 모델과 PCSI Index를 활용한 공공도서관 노인 서비스 품질 개선에 관한 연구,"The purpose of this study is to classify the quality attributes of service quality for the elderly in public libraries, derive satisfaction coefficients and dissatisfaction coefficients, and present the priority improvement of service quality. To this end, a survey was organized with 22 questions from LibQUAL+ for elderly users who use library in uiseong-gun, gyeongsangbuk-do. Quality factors for service were classified into three areas of LibQUAL+ based on the kano model, and the satisfaction index and dissatisfaction index felt by users for each service quality were calculated through timko’s customer satisfaction coefficient. Based on this, a Potential Customer Satisfaction Improvement index (PCSI index) was obtained to determine how much user satisfaction can be improved when actual requirements are met. As a result of classification of quality attributes of service quality, it was classified into 9 attractive quality, 7 one-dimensional quality, 1 indifference quality, and 5 must-be quality. In the improvement ranking for service, the first place was ‘making electronic resources accessible from my home or office’, the second place was ‘print and/or electronic journal collections I require for my work’ and the third place was ‘a library web site enabling me to locate information on my’. It is expected that the study results can be used to present quality factors that should be managed and improved first when providing services for the elderly.",엄재은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108529874
