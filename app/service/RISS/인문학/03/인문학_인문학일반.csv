Based on the case studies on the autonomous vehicle and legaltech, this paper pointed out the proposition AI would replace human jobs very rapidly could not be realized. In the case of autonomous vehicle, AI and human driver co-exist up to the fourth level automation, and full automation can be partially actualized in the form of unmanned shuttles and autonomous trucks. In the case of legaltech, the possibility for AI to replace judicial officers will be considerably restricted because of not only various institutional and cultural conditions but also the problem of fairness and explainability of AI. And then this paper argued human abilities difficult to be replaced by AI even if AI would be continuously developed. However AI conducts some tasks concerning creativity, emotion, and judgment among human tacit knowledges, creative problematization ability, emotional bonding ability, overall judgment ability will remain as human distinct ability for a long time.",송성수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108040590

크리스퍼 유전자가위 기술의 윤리적 문제,"This study aims to examine the discussions over the ethical issues on the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. We point out that the technology needs urgent attention and its impacts must be examined both from the social and the ethical perspective. The strong power of influence and the potentiality of CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing also demand novel approaches with regard to the ethical discourses of the new technology. First, we have tackled the CRISPR-related ethical issues based on the actor-network theory according to which technology exists in the physical, human and sociocultural networks.
Second, limitations of the liberalism-oriented perspective on ethics and technology were also discussed. Considering the powerful and complex ramifications of new technology in general, we suggest the approaches from the perspective of communitarian ethics which may justify the necessity of regulations against the misuse of the technology in order to promote public goodness.",최윤주,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107152217
의학에서 인공지능 도입의 현재와 미래,"The Alpha Go event of 2016 reflects today's feelings mixed with anxiety and anticipation about Artificial intelligence(AI). AI was about only to mimic a single human nerve, but now it has reached a level that can simulate a human neural network. As computing power increases exponentially, AI has become more applicable and has entered the medical field. If the accuracy of the AI based diagnosis is higher than that of the human, the possibility of transferring the authority of diagnosis from human to AI based diagnosis is likely to be the choice of the Evidence Based Medicine. Furthermore, when the diagnosis or treatment of AI proves to be superior or more accurate than a human physician, the normative level of the physician's duty of care will change. If so, will AI be perceived as a human being or a subject of medical practice? It will be a question whether AI can become a legal entity that can be responsible for the wrongdoing. In the case of automobiles in which modern technology is integrated and operated in a complex way, even if problems arise in the process of intelligent work that is based on decision making, the service or automobile is not responsible for the accident on its own. In other words, if the machine does not know exactly what the human will is, or if the machine can not perform correctly, the responsibility for the accident is mainly the manufacturer. It is difficult to define intelligence as it is now, and it is more difficult and ambiguous to define AI. Therefore, it is difficult to maintain logical persuasiveness in discussing the legal subjecthood of AI in the current state. On the other hand, the benefits expected from the introduction of AI medicine include avoiding human error, reducing costs, improving quality of care, and preventing health inequalities. However, as long as AI will bring more light into the future, its shadow can also become darker. As the spread of artificial intelligence dissemination, layperson who do not know programming will be able to participate in patching and spreading of fake information, and wrong medical information can be spread more easily and quickly through AI service. In addition, though the things, such as medical care, nursing, filling prescription or medication instruction, that are regarded as only human being can do are done by AI, and if it is hard to distinguish by whom it has been done, then the mutual relationship of human being and its value will inevitably weakened. Furthermore, AI still remains at the level of simulating some functions of human intelligence, if AI become similar to the god of self existence and controls human life with its free will, we need to reconsider whether it is right to continue to develop these technologies.",동재준,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106018516
르네상스 시대 여성의 지위,"Renaissance was supposed to be the period in which people in Western Europe had enjoyed cultural rebirth and intellectual freedom. But did Women have a Renaissance? Or is Renaissance just another periodization made by male-centered historians? Understanding how women had lived during the "" Renaissance"" is important because it can complement or correct "" his-story."" It is also essential for comprehending the theatrical world of the leading dramatists of the 16th or 17th centuries such as William Shakespeare, Thomas Middleton, and John Webster.
Ironically, during the ""Renaissance."" women had lost finanical rights, political power, and sexual freedom which some Medieval women had enjoyed. While Medieval feudalism permitted both inheritance and administration of property by women, in the Renaissance, women(except for widows) lost the legal rights to own property. The disappearance of ""courtly love"" deprived women of choosing their lovers and enjoying sexual freedom. The collapes of Catholicism and emergence of Protestantism undermined women's rights to a certain degree because women had lost the right to live as a single9for instance, as a nun) and had to be bound by ""marriage"" in which patriarchal power was strengthened. While the family system in the Medieval age was "" the extended family"" in which women's own family could give them emotional as well as financial support, that of the Renaissance was ""the Restricted Patriarchal Nuclear family"" which strengthened the husnands' right govern their family. Protestant theologians emphasized the sanctity of marriage and for the continuation of marriage system, they demanded women's absolute obedience to their husbands and chastity as well .
Women in the Renaissance could not enjoy ""cultural rebirth"": rather they suffered the deprivation of the basic human rights which the medieval wimen could have. But there were some playwrights who perceived social injustice against women such as Middleton and Webster. Their works include the laments of a maid and a widow who are forced to subordinate to the patriarchal authority. Their works show that even in the Dark Age, the seed of enlightenment and the potential for ""change"" were germinating.",金素任,1993,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2055175

R. Strauss 交響時의 特性에 關한 考察,"R. Strauss has been a great figure in the 20th century.
His career as a composer ended as it had begun with the writing of music, classical in structure, Romantic feeling, warm with pleasing melodies and gracious with conventional harmonies.
As a young man R. Strauss was strongly opposed to R. Wagner, but through his friendship with the poes A.Ritter, he became convinced of the validity of the methods and ideals of H.Berlioz, F.Liszt and R.Wagner.
His earlist and last symphonic poems become difficult to remember that between these two periods, R.Strauss produced works that shocked and outraged the world and made him one of its most provocative musical figures. In these symphonic poems R.Strauss gave a new importance, as well as independence, to discords: in might well be said that he was one of the first important composer to make effective use of unresolved discords.
He also enriched and extended the art and science of orchestration. With R.Strauss the orchestra assumed the role of a virtuoso and extended orchestral colorations. Each instrument shared equal importance with every other instruments.
R.Strauss' works for synphony orchestra have been largely accepted as the consummation not only of the use of the grand orchestra as a musical instrument, but also of the aims of the romanticists with regard to the symphonic poem genera.",朴鍾源,1981,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30036180
복제인간은 존엄한가?,"Clone Technology has made a startling progress.
In July. 1996, the birth of Dolly the cloned sheep created a sensation. The whole world buzzed with the news because the sheep was the first clone animal from a somatic cell and this clone technology could eventually provide a momentum for human cloning. Now that 6 years and a half have passed since the clone sheep was born: how far has Clone Technology come into fruition and how much of it has been permitted in the new frontier?
Panayiotis Zavos, who has published human cloning project with Severino Antinori, has stated that human cloning technique has been advanced by rapid stride, and that a cloned baby will be born at the end of this year or at the beginning of next year. (Publication: 2002. 5.) And while the opinions of the announcement were divided, a surprising news was added. The news was a formal announcement from ""Clonaid"" in America that a pregnant woman with a cloned human embryo has come to Korea on June. 2002. (Publication: 2002. 7.)
Although human cloning is an epoch-making event, it is moving without our awareness of the consequences and is still carried out in secrecy in laboratories without proper limit and control.
Therefore we have to think over without delay ""the future which human cloning affects humanity"". Since the advent of sheep cloning, the arguments for and against human cloning have been wide spread from immoral investigations to scientific breakthroughs. But it seems that the conferences and countermovement of human cloning can not catch up with the scientific investigations in the new frontier. Before it is too late, we will have to put our heads together to set yardsticks for the complexities in human cloning.
I propose that we consider ""philosophical-anthropological"" consideration for human cloning for two reasons. One, human cloning must be pondered in a way of mutual osmosis with ""philosophical-anthropological"" problems: what is a human being?, what is a human death?, how should human beings be created?, what should the life of a human being be like? and so forth. And two, humanity is now facing the serious crisis of self-individuality in the face of human cloning, so humanity must bring up anew the problem for human being.
""Philosophical-anthropological"" consideration is to comprehend ethical, religious, and metaphysical pursuit with biological, medical, and scientifical research outcomes. This comprehensive approach is a ""philosophical-anthropological"" request to correlate intellectual with biological aspects in human totality. ""Philosophical-anthropological"" consideration calls for interdependent and cooperative researches.
""Philosophical-anthropological"" consideration, as we bring up anew the problem of human being, is the exertion to establish human's self-understanding and to determine history's direction.
In sum, I will begin a ""philosophical-anthropological"" consideration for human cloning with the problem: is clone human dignified? I will attempt to answer this question by focusing on the major debates of human cloning to four sections: self-identity, un-naturalness, un-safety, and possibility of instrumentalization. And after having focused on the four major problems with its complexities and issues, I will provide for a detailed examination and recommend a direction for human cloning insofar as it affects humanity.",한희숙,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40129444

한일 양국의 ‘임나일본부’를 바라보는 시각 변화 추이,"This article reviews research trend on ""Imnailbonbu,"" a critical issue of the history of ancient Korea and Japan relations. The general trend of earlier studies on ‘Imnailbonbu’ had taken the mythical contents of Nihonshoki(『日本書紀』), thereby understanding ""Imnailbonbu"" as ""the Japanese colonial institution in the southern parts of the Korean peninsula."" This view was synthesize by Suematsu Yasukazu(末松保和). According to him, ‘Imnailbonbu’ was a military outpost of the Yamato government in Japan and ruled over those regions with administrative and diplomatic functions.
After 1970, revisionists started to assert that Suematsu""s hypotheses―which were regarded as a kind of common view in the academic world of Japan―should be reconsidered and thus there has been a variety of approaches to ""Imnailbonbu."" Nevertheless, almost all studies still considered ""Imnailbonbu"" as the Japanese colonial institution.
Thanks to the active excavations of Gaya archeological sites since 1990s, it became possible to accumulate a considerable amounts of archeological materials and activate research on history of Gaya. This enabled us to broaden and deepen our understanding the ancient Korean history. In addition to this, the academic world of Korea started to interpret references on Gaya in Nihonshoki more critically, thereby presenting more advanced opinions on ""Imnailbonbu"" Therefore, ""Imnailbonbu"" has been understood as a consequence of international diplomacy between the southern areas of the Korean peninsula and Japan.
Recent studies on ‘Imnailbonbu’ can be summarized as follows. First, ""Imnailbonbu"" was defined as those who were responsible for diplomatic mission, considering the fact that the records related to ""Imnailbonbu"" were mostly concerned with diplomatic missions and that kun(訓; a way of pronunciation based on the meanings of a Kanji) of ‘bu(府)’ is ‘mikotomochi(ミコトモツチ),’ which means ‘an envoy(使臣).’ Second, the field of action of ‘Imnailbonbu’ was Allaguk(安羅國), which is known from the use of the word ""Allailbonbu."" Third, all uses of the word ""Imnailbonbu,"" except only one use of it in Yuryakuki(雄略紀), are concentrated in Kinmeiki(欽明紀), which means that the period when ""Imnailbonbu"" was working is counted as the first half of the 6th century.",이연심,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101793692
치료적 관계에서의 의사소통에 관한 이론적고찰,"The nures's role has evolved over the past 150 years from ""helping"" the patient suffering from disease in Nightingale's era to the diagnosis and treatment of human responses in the 1980s. Today, the nurses role is typified as a collaboration one. It includes specialized functions and activities related to wellness as well as illness.
Such trends of modern nursing have created greater demands on the abilty of nurses to communicate effectively with patients. What communication with patients can be therapeutic, is supported by expermental evidence as well as clinical observation.
Therapeutic communication can be defined as perception by a human being of behavior by another person that leads to a greater level of wellbeing on the part of the perceiver. The nursing literature supports the idea that the nurse must be genuine and open in the relationship with patients. If the nurse enters the relationship as a person rather than a technician or a nurse, the patient is more inclined to be himself.
In this point of view, I focused to provide the theoritical basis of therapeutic communication, and to improve nurses' ability to become more empathic, congenial, and accepting.

맥도날드의 진출을 통해 본 세계화와 지구지역화,"For some years, there have been widespread and on-going discussions over the issue of globalization from various perspectives. Some take a positive view of the issue, saying that globalization, in the end, benefits all of us; others take a defensive stance against globalization, defining it as imperialist invasion. The same goes for the cultural globalization issue. Some argue that unless we make efforts to preserve our local culture, our cultures will be homogenized into one dominant global culture, and our cultural objects will become mere commodities in the global market with the trend of cultural imperialism. Others welcome globalization as benefiting cultural diversity, greatly esteeming the willingness of local cultures to embrace the larger global culture and assimilate into it.
With our world globalizing, we are witnessing the phenomena of cultural homogenization as well as cultural heterogenization and cultural pluralism, all at the same time. In this context, the concept of glocality becomes very significant because glocalization, a combination of the terms ""global"" and ""local,"" can serve as an alternative to globalization. Instead of local cultures becoming objects assimilated into global culture, glocalization may enable local cultures to better understand different cultures of the world.
McDonald’s, a leading global brand, has become a symbol of globalization in cultural and economic contexts. McDonald’s, at the same time, represents glocalization with its regionalization efforts accommodating local cultures as it expands into many international markets.
Since 1997, McDonald’s in Korea has been adapting to local Korean culture, offering a regionalized version of its menu, such as the Bulgogi Burger and the Shrimp Burger, to satisfy the palate of the Korean people. This wouldn’t have been possible without a deep understanding of Korean culture as well as of the sentiments of Koreans. As a multinational corporation, McDonald’s clearly saw the importance of keeping up with the current trends of local culture, communicating effectively inter-culturally, and implementing cultural regionalization strategically.
Yet, on a closer look, we see the phenomenon of
McDonald’s glocalization efforts as only superficial. In other words, McDonald’s regionalization efforts were made only for the purpose of making maximum profits in the market, without genuine interest in going local. Therefore, in research on glocality, we need to explore how two important issues of the preservation of local culture and the integration into global culture can go hand in hand and how a new paradigm of glocalized culture can be created.",김수자,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99551881

퍼스널 컬러 진단과 메이크업 색채 활용에 관한 연구,"In modern society, consumers' desires and emotions are considered important. 50 the
desire of expression is pursued to meet the personal identity. Due to the change of a
sense of values and social phenomena, the personal color system is not only quite
important means to express identity, but also ways to be different from others.
The colors in make-up vary and widen in using colors because of personal respective
body color. The colors itself have a variety of feelings, but its function and effectiveness
can be improved by make-up.
When applying the colors to make-up, the colors which become the original body
color have an effect on making personal image positive. Therefore we need to know the
original body color, by which the proper color ought to be used when directing personal
image.
The color that become the body color varies according to the types, and is divided
into two colors; the color to become and the color to avoid. The reason why becoming
color is important is that the color makes people healthier and more beautiful, and
makes up for the defects.
This research suggests make-up colors which become the natural body color, and by
synthesizing theories related to colors and personal color system, demonstration to
perform make-up direction is done by means of the color diagnosis in reality.
By conducting the color diagnosis to different types of models, and putting on
make-up using both becoming make-up color and unbecoming one, the following results
could be drawn.
First, when the becoming color is used for image-making, pimples, spots and so forth
on the face look weak, harmonious and healthy overall thanks to making up for the
defects. On the other hand, when the unbecoming color is used, the result was opposite.
Second, the natural images, emotions and mental effects which each color has,
although the make-up color is used in extremely small part, seemed to influence the
entire image.
As a result, it can be said that make-up color application has enough synergistic effect
of personal image just by using colors properly with the results of personal color
diagnosis. Furthermore, if understanding the essential characters that the colors have and
utilizing personal color system harmoniously, maybe image direction to become each

의료용 나노로봇 기술에 대한 전망과 과제,"Medical nanorobots are nanoscale robots with medical functions and are important parts of nanomedicine and nanomarkets, where results can be expected not only in the diagnosis and treatment areas, such as drug delivery systems and cancer treatment, but also in brain research. Medical nanorobots are areas to which bioethics, engineering ethics, and philosophical theories can be applied. Therefore it is necessary to discuss and reflect on nanoethics as a new ethical model for nanotechnology. The issue of nanoethics, for example, the issue of equity that resolves the nano-devide as an equity issue, privacy protection, and human ability enhancement, which raises essential issues related to human identity, is an ethical issue inevitably raised at the stage of R&D and commercialization of medical nanorobots.
It will be necessary to explore the social conditions required for nanotechnology to develop in more desirable direction. How to introduce future nanotechnology clinical research and commercialization programs, how transparent and openly these decisions are made, how well the needs and perceptions of all stakeholders are reflected and accepted, and whether these needs are reflected in policies should be considered. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine not only the impact on the human body and the environment, but also the problems that arise socially and ethically.

배우를 위한 알렉산더 테크닉의 효과적인 활용 연구,"The acting is the art form revealing the human life through the emotional and physical expression, which means that it is not mere superficial imitation, but deed presenting actor's viewpoint on life. Furthermore, it explains why the two views, internal and external approach, about training for actors are needed. Practically, the actor's open body is closely related to the free emotional state. Also, the relaxed
body which removes unnecessary tension is connected to the internal thinking of the actors, it is simultaneously helpful to reach the optimum state to react to the creative
impulse. The Alexander Technique, named after Frederick Matthias Alexander, has been evaluated as a very useful 'Work on Self' training method for the actors by
connecting organically the inner self and the external self. We tend to compare the body of the actor to the instrument, however, if the actor believes focusing on the external approach that the acting is only to turn into others without knowing what he/she is, it is the same as the musician gives a rendition without grasping the characteristics of his/her instrument. It is one of the most important basic training methods to recognize self in the acting technique which uses himself with the medium of representation.
In contrast with the basic training methods in order to enhance the body application or correction of posture such as mime, acrobatics, dance, fencing, boxing, martial arts, and vocal music, the Alexander Technique through physical relaxation accords closely with the training objectives which is to maximize the physical and emotional expression. Moreover, the Alexander Technique which is vastly utilized by creative people using their body with major tool like dancers, musicians, and actors has proved that a relaxed condition is closely related to creative energy. This thesis covers the pre-phase training of role creating focused on tension relaxation and the actual utilization of the Alexander Technique in the process of role
creating centered on body modification and vocal training. The practical application of the Alexander Technique can make actors foster a keen sense and realize the comprehension and the application method about their bodies. Thereby reeducating the elimination of needless habit by themselves, the actors can enhance the openness

대원군의 쇄국정책에 관한 연구,"Just before the emergence of the Hungson Daewon-gun or the Prince Regent, Choson Dynasty was, in a word, depression and degeneration itself. Besides, political influences from King Kojong's maternal relatives starting from the early 19th century drove the dynasty into further disorder and confusion. Evil practices of bribery as well as exploitation openly done, the collapse of Choson Dynasty was quite imminent.
It was none other than Daewon-gun, however, who set out to firmly establish the dynasty again amid this political crisis. He actually carried out drastic reforms, strengthening the then unstable royal authority at last. Faced with the incessant approaches from Western powers, Choson was at a loss whether to open its door to them or not. After all, the Daewon-gun resolutely rejected any compromise with the outer world. Such fundamental policy brought about the Incident of Kanghwa-do which was called the two (Pyongin & Shinmi) invasions by Western powers. We refer to this as ""the Daewon-gun's national isolation policy."" And many argue that the very policy prevented Korea from modernization.
Nonetheless, the Prince Regent left many remarkable achievements ranging from expulsion of external influences, appointment of the talents to readjustment and abolition of sowon (academic as well as memorial hall for Confucianist services). Unfortunately, however, he fell from power on account of severe oppression of the Catholics and anti-open policy toward foreign nations. But the course of modernization in Korea, regardless of its pace, gradually developed into industrialized society of democratic republic due to the determination and willingness of a bold and sagacious leader under the absolute monarchy.
In addition, it is very convincing that the absolute presupposition of successful modernization of a nation depends on the sovereign nation of powerful independence. In this sense, we can not discuss the history of our country's modernization without giving more careful consideration to the Daewon-gun's era. Therefore his achievements deserve reassessment.",윤진헌,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2074704
몰입·창의성 공간 메타버스에서의 문학콘텐츠: ‘제페토 드라마’를 중심으로,"The purpose of this study is to explore a new way of enjoying literature after the global pandemic, based on ‘ZEPETO Drama’, a creative literary play that took place in the metaverse. The MZ generation, who are already familiar with digital since birth and growing up, has emerged as a major tier of consumption and enjoyment in the cultural industry. Accordingly, there is a need to break away from the idea that literature should be experienced only through the face-to-face method of the analog world and focus on the case of literary communication using multimedia channels. In particular, this study attempted to examine the creative behavior and enjoyment of literary contents in the metaverse.
This study first looked at the reasons for the rapid rise in popularity of the metaverse after the global pandemic, and examines the creation and enjoyment of literary contents in the metaverse space. Second, we looked at the cases of creative literary play that appeared in the metaverse. As an example, the ZEPETO drama of 'Lee-Ho(YouTube content creator)', a user who works as a ‘ZEPETO Creator’ on ZEPETO, a metaverse platform, was selected as a verification case. Third, based on Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's theory, the metaverse, a digital virtual world, proved to be an immersive space and a space of creativity, and for this reason, the creative literary play ZEPETO Drama could be created inductively.
In conclusion, this study confirmed that the metaverse is an appropriate space for metaverse users to engage in creative activities through immersion experiences. In addition, through the study of ZEPETO drama, a case of creative literary play, it was confirmed that the production of literary contents that the next generation can enjoy is sufficiently possible through the metaverse. Although this study is still an experimental metaverse literary play, it is significant in that it examines the sufficiently open development potential.",차진명,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108313048
COVID-19 시대 비대면 e-PBL 원격교육의 효과적 운영 방안 탐색,"The purpose of this study is to explore ways to effectively operate online problem-based learning that can be suggested as an alternative method in the non-face-to-face online distance education situation that has emerged as a new normal due to COVID-19. To this end, I analyzed the needs of professors who had conducted PBL and e-PBL at the university, and compared and analyzed their perception of the PBL effect. The research results are as follows. First, it is necessary for professors to have sufficient education on understanding and operating methods of PBL classes. Second, it is necessary to pre-design and prepare PBL through individual consulting with experts. Third, it is necessary to provide professors and students with a variety of online tools that can promote team activities and promote interaction in online, and education of how to use them. Fourth, it is necessary to prepare internal and external motivation systems to enhance the willingness and effort of active participation of professors and students. The results of this study will provide practical implications for successfully operating and improving the quality of non-face-to-face online problem-based learning.",최미나,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107307403
홀로그램 기술을 활용한 문화유산 전시 사례 분석 연구,"A hologram is described as a 'screenless display' that provides a realism and three-dimensional effect as if seeing a real object, and refers to a technology that implements a three-dimensional stereoscopic image using laser light. These holograms are currently being used in various cultural industries such as performances, exhibitions, and advertisements. In particular, pseudo-holograms such as floating techniques are mainly used in the cultural heritage exhibition field. However, pseudo-holograms can implement the same effect as holograms that show virtual 3D images in the real world, but there are still practical and technical limitations in satisfying audiences who want perfect 3D images like those seen in science fiction movies. The hologram, which is attracting attention as a future high-value-added imaging technology, can naturally reproduce real or virtual objects in a three-dimensional space as if they were real. In addition, holography technology is expected to lead the growth of the immersive content industry in the future by improving the technical limitations of the current augmented reality(AR) or virtual reality(VR). Therefore, if the current holography technology is gradually improved and supplemented with hologram screen, hologram printing, and plenoptic visualization technology, it is expected that the field of digital heritage contents and exhibitions using hologram will further develop in the future.",위상희(Sang-hee Wi),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108488608

새로운 박물관 전시 전략으로서의개방형 수장고의 의미,"Open storage created with the concept of democratization of museums or open museum, are spreading internationally, receiving positive reviews for the participation and accessibility of visitors to the common cultural heritage of mankind. In addition, major national museums in Korea are promoting the establishment of open storage. Open storage, which emerged as a practical way to promote better access to collections by visitors, has now become an important strategy for museums to attract and interest visitors. The spread of open storage is the result of efforts to show the hidden spaces of the museum that the general public has not seen before, such as the storage, laboratory, and conservation science room, which were spaces behind the stage of exhibitions. In a sense, what the museum wants to show through the open storage is not only the collection, but also the open storage itself. The open storage is a great exhibit in itself. The visual experience of being overwhelmed by the scale of the museum's collection is an awe created by humans, that allows us to measure the time and amount of the accumulated collection seen beyond the object, creating a ‘sublime’ experience that arouses fear or admiration. Most of the previous studies related to open storage are limited to a small number of studies related to education or architecture and design, so conceptual and practical research on the function and meaning of open storage is insufficient. Therefore, in terms of the visitors' appreciation of open storages, the purpose of this study is to find out what kind of intentions museums are building and utilizing open storages, and to draw implications by examining the current state of domestic museum exhibitions.",황규진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108393850
