
문학과 영화의 몽타쥬,"This thesis examines the relationship of Eisenstein's montage principle and the japanese classic poetry Haiku. It is well-known that Eisenstein's 'montage of collision' in the twenties was stimulated from some literary works like the japanese old poems, Haiku and Tanka as well as Charles Dickens' and James Joyce's novels. The russian film theorist and director Sergei M. Eisenstein (1898-1948) mentioned on the relation of his montage theory and the Haiku in his essay 'The Cinematographic Principle and The Ideogramm' (1929) etc.
The author found out the japanese original texts of the four english translations which Eisenstein cited in this essay and compared the both texts to analyze the elements of his montage theory. The english Haiku expressed in three short sentences functions like three different filmic images, while the original Haiku which is only one short sentence usually with seventeen sounds would suggest one image. In the english versions of Haiku where the two or three different images seem to produce 'the third image' in the sense of Eisenstin's 'theory of dialectical montage', discovered Eisenstein the principle of montage and applied it in his films 'Strike' (1925), 'The Battleship Potemkin' (1925) and 'October' (1927) etc.
From the comparison between the original and english versions of Haiku it cannot be denied that Eisenstein overinterpreted the Haiku. Roland Barthe, the french cultural anthropologist regard the Haiku as the ""anti-descriptive miniature"", which refuse to be interpreted for a certain meaning, and as a merely ""view without comment"" connected to the spirit of Zen. But it is also true that as the non-representative artistic form the japanese Haiku gave substantial stimulus to Eisenstein, the modernist artist, eargerly searching for the artistic methods in which his 'montage of collision' could be practised.",이상면,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108741628
박찬욱의 <헤어질 결심>에 나타난 영화의 자기반영성,"Director Park Chan-wook’s <Decision to Leave> is a hybrid narrative that connects a love story to a mystery story. The symmetrical structure of the story, divided into parts 1 and 2, implies the relationship between truth and lies. Seorae is the one who leads the change in the story. Seorae transforms like a character in different movie genres and quotes movie lines as if they were her own words, which shows how she is a metaphor for movies.
There are self-reflective forms in this film. The screen is expressed through a point of view where the subject of the gaze is unclear. The sound of breathing, the voice on the phone, and the sound recorded on the phone are devices that make the audience identify with Hae-jun’s emotions. The audience views an imaginary image in which Hae-jun’s desire is projected; it is an image like a movie within a movie. Hae-jun, who seeks the hidden truth, is a person who searches and analyzes time. Hae-jun’s gaze connects the present and the past in one frame. He makes the strata of time like a frame within a frame, or a movie within a movie.
<Decision to Leave> is a film that depicts director Park Chan-wook’s cinematic aesthetics and art. Ambiguity is the key to understanding this film. Like a “phone thrown into the depths of the sea”, a great movie cannot be interpreted as an explanation or as a single truth. A movie that resonates with the audience and connects with many viewers is like the truth hidden in the sea. <Decision to Leave> is a movie about cinema, the screen, and film as it is defined by its audience.",심은진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40099035
애트우드의 매드아담 3부작에 나타난 포스트휴먼 유스토피아,"Differentiated from traditional dystopias, this paper analyzes the ways Margaret Atwood imagines and formalizes humankind’s transformation into post-human ustopian forms. Discontent with the traditional notion of dystopia as a mode of anti-utopia, Atwood coins “ustopia,” a concept this paper reads as tantamount to immanent dystopia. Her ustopia is not entirely imaginary nor displaced into a distant future, but is revealed within real and relatable places where multinational corporations have taken control of every social and subjective dimension. The first installment of Atwood’s trilogy, Oryx and Crake (2003), narrates the pre- and post-apocalyptic world from the perspective of Jimmy. The second, The Year of the Flood (2009), returns to the plot in the first, but from the perspective of the two female protagonists. The narrators and the characters in this set of assembled texts do not function simply as narrators or characters, but instead can be read as a collective, assembled together through Atwood’s extensive use of free indirect discourse. The third novel, MaddAddam (2013), reveals a post-apocalyptic community consisting of humans, posthumans, hybridized animals, and sundry other creatures: in sum, a kind of post-human ustopia where species not only co-exist but outlast and live beyond the anthropocene.",전소영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40042539
오이디푸스 신화의 수용과 변형,"This paper is intended as an investigation of how Oedipus` myth was received and transformed not only in Homer, Hesiod, and Thebaid epics, but also how it was interpreted by Aeschylos and Sophokles. This investigation focuses especially on the reception and transformation of Oedipus` myth in Sophokles` Oedipus the King, and it will show how great and unique this drama turned out to be. Compared with Sophokles` Oedipus the King, Homer`s Odyssey 11, 271-280 did not further develop motives, such as children of incest, self-punishment in terms of blinding oneself and expulsion from the city of Thebes. Such motives only became fully developed in Greek Tragedy. Following the motives of the Thebaid epics, indeed, Aeschlylos repeated those motives, such as the family curse and the role of the Furies in his Theban trilogy, Laios, Oedipus, and Seven against Thebes. But the poet introduced the children of incest motive to dramatize both the mutual destruction of Oedipus` two sons and the downfall of his royal family. On the other hand, the fate of Oedipus` royal family, especially in Seven against Thebes, was dramatized to signify the rescuing of the city state. Sophokles transformed Oedipus` myth not in the dramatic form of a trilogy, but in the condensed unit of Oedipus the King; he did not dramatize the whole complex of the downfall of Oedipus` royal family, but rather highlight Oedipus` tragic fate. Furthermore, in dealing with an Aeschylean plot pattern Sophokles invented a new plot pattern, i.e. error - recognition - self-determination to dramatize not only the main theme of Oedipus the King, the limitations of human knowledge, but also to portray Oedipus` heroism. The theme of the limitations of human knowledge was intensively dramatized by the poet`s use of dramaturgy, such as the confusion of one and many, tragic irony, and tragic dialectic. Despite its overall emphasis on the theme, Oedipus the King gives the impression that Oedipus, the incarnation of historie(""inquiry""), comes to transcend the limitation of human knowledge through his heroic self-determination. This leads to a paradoxical reconciliation of opposites through concepts, such as suffering and knowledge, progression of human knowledge and religious belief, and tradition and innovation. Accordingly, Sophokles seems to send a message of reconciliation to the conflicting political positions in the city state of Athens.",김기영 ( Kee Young Kim ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108614238
스타니슬랍스키 연극론에 있어서 배우와 역할의 관계,"This study reviewed ‘System’ suggested by Stanislavsky and “Creating a Role” written by him, in order to look into Stanislavsky’s thought on the relationship among actors, roles in a play and roles to be played on a stage. “Creating a Role” was not completed by Stanislavsky but by editors after his death. There are differences in times when each chapter was written and also in the author’s attitude and opinion toward the creation of a role. In the early years he emphasized that actors should dam up and control their feelings, and maintained that they should define the essence of emotion and should grope for actions to bring out it. In later years, however, he proposed ‘the method of physical actions’ based on imagination and improvisatory acting, suggesting that it should come before what actors analyzes a play and their roles. Even so, they are little different in the attitude toward plays and ways to create a role based on the actor’s physical activity and experience and to feel the play. Stanislavsky maintained that performing arts should be centered on creative actors, and his thought led to a study on the system. He wished actors to have experience of existing as their roles on the stage. Of course, he did not hope to get rid of the boundary between actors’ own selves and their roles on the stage. He particularly stressed that actors should be immersed in their roles but at the same time should be aware of themselves as actors. Actors are not characters on the stage. Actors comprehend their roles and lead their lives on the stage, and at the same time, they are subjects who control their roles consciously. Stanislavsky believed that without actual experiences, actors could not make the characters come to life on the stage. Such experiences are what he wanted to gain with the method of physical actions. In this regard, an actor should be an actor as well as a controller; specifically, an actor should completely go into the character and act the character so as to communicate them to the audience. Herein lies the artistic completeness of which Stanislavsky dreamed.",이진아 ( Chin A Lee ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105217060
러시아의 우크라이나 침공과 언어 문제,"On February 21, 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine. One of the causes of the invasion is the language problem.
Since its founding, Russia and the Russian people have made great efforts to solidify Russian language as a means of combating illiteracy, spreading communism around the world, and expanding and preserving its function and role as the most basic means of inter-ethnic communication for Soviet Union, made up of more than 130 ethnic groups,
After the official dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, President Putin created and operated a foundation called Ruskij Mir Fond in June 2007 to develop and disseminate Russian language and culture.
It is clear that Russians, Russian-speaking residents, and the justification for Russian protection in Ukraine are clearly one important cause of this military operation. The consequences of the Russo-Ukraine war are hard to predict, but if Russia fails to achieve its goals, it will have a significant impact on the international status of the Russian language, which plays a corresponding role in the post-Soviet space.",정경택,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103237768
드라마의 교육 방법적 활용 방안 모색,"In 2011, Seoul metropolitan office of education has launched educational drama program which helps teachers teach their subjects with dramatic methods. This attempt reflects a trend that educational drama is rapidly booming nowadays and gives rise to deeper discussion of drama as a learning medium. Specially, the employment of dramatic method is done mainly in primary school so that it remains as simple mechanical applications of dramatic conventions. Hence, dramatic method for acquiring complex concepts is demanded. In this context, this study suggests Heathcote`s process-centered drama which is regarded as a method to encompass a wide range of meaning making. In Heathcote`s process-centered drama, three- layered meaning can be produced: meaning coming from identification; meaning coming from distancing; meaning coming from metaxis. Having included a variety of meaning making, Heathcote`s process-centered drama is appropriate for middle and high school curriculum. Besides, this study provides the principle of process-centered drama which is emotional engagement and critical detachment. To embody this principle, devices are listed: living through drama, interest and consensus, teacher-in-role, finding connection, critical reflection and self-spectatorship. The outcome of application of Heathcote`s process-centered drama into middle school classroom is persuasively positive. Therefore, this study suggests Heathcote`s process-centered drama as an effective learning medium for understanding complex concepts. Emotional engagement and critical detachment are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the process-centered drama.",김주연 ( Joo Yon Kim ),2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107858222
대위법적 문명의 의미 탐색 : 헉슬리의 『멋진 신세계』,"This paper aims to explore the meaning of ""civilization"" often addressed in the Brave New World. It is not until one understands the writer""s point-counterpoint narrative that the re/discovery of the civilization in the new world is fully made through a step-by-step approach to the text. Accordingly, the past and present historical meaning of the New Mexican Reservation should be first reviewed to know why Huxley foregrounds the reservation along with the brave new world in the text. Secondly, two episodes will be compared; the past historical episode that Gorillas were exhibited in London in 1861 and the present fictional one that John the Savage from New Mexico Reservation is experimented with as an ape in the zoo. Creating the point-counterpoint narrative quoting or using many of the historical or fictional characters in the novel, Huxley has implicitly led us to rediscover what the real civilization should be like in the future unlike that depicted in the dystopian novel. Huxley seems to suggest the attitudes that T. H. Huxley and Matthew Arnold should have had in their argument as to which one is superior to the other, science or culture/literature; T. H. Huxley should have more valued the culture and literature, and Matthew Arnold the science. In brief, Aldous Huxley argues those two should be integrated into the social and cultural society. Finally Huxley seems to say that it is only when both humanity and science are reciprocally respected that human society would prosper without losing the value of humanity even in the scientific world.","추재욱(Choo, Jae-Uk)",2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108174958
이중모음 /ㅢ/의 통시적 연구,"The purpose of the present study is to find some diachronic and synchronic evidences showing that the Korean diphthong /ㅢ/ is on-glide rather than off-glide (as most previous studies claimed). For this purpose, we will investigate 1) how the monothongal and diphthongal structure of middle Korean changed in morden and contemporary Korean, and 2) why they get through this historical changes (i. e. what triggered the historical changes of diphthongal system of middle Korean). In modern Korean, the syllable structure changes and off-glide is not allowed any longer. Therefore, off-glides in the vowel structure has to find some ways to change their structures. Nucleus movement(change the status between the nucleus and the glide within the syllable structure) and monothongisation are the possilbe changes. Off-glides /ㅐ , ㅔ/, which cannot change their status within the syllable structure, are converted into monothongs /ㅐ, ㅔ/. On the other hand, off-glides /ㅢ, ㅚ, ㅟ/ are converted into either monothongs or on-glides by changing their syllabic status.",신지영,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60253175
트라우마의 재현과 시청,"Psychological theories of trauma have explained how the experience of physical harm or life-threatening situations can cause long-term behavioral and memory disorders. These theories explain the destructive effect of trauma on victims and allow greater empathy for them. Today, visual media such as film, television, and the Internet regularly contain vivid depictions of violence and catastrophe. Although the impact of these representations has been an going focus of trauma research, people appear to have learn how to watch representations of extreme violence without suffering obvious psychological effects. However, this conclusion may be premature in that recent trauma theories, developed by authors such as Shoshana Felman and Cathy Caruth, tend to concern to excessive exact and authentic transmission of trauma. This research trend does not explore multiple and extended means of experiencing trauma or suggest an acceptable mode of transmission for media saturated with traumatic images and representations. The aim of this article is to critique current trauma theory and to explore other ways to portray traumatic experiences in modem media. As an alternative strategy, the discussion draws on Joshua Hirsch's notion of ""post-traumatic cinema"" and suggests possible direction for transmitting and perceiving traumatic experiences through an analysis of the film, Grbavica: Land of My Dream, which presents an example of the strategy.",서길완,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108081293

However, the point of this study is not simply repeated the result of advanced research. Through this narration strategy, it is trying to reveal how he had his own individual territory in the popular culture, and how his strategy interact and reveal the meaning in the popular culture. The important thing in hers narration strategy is ``the preoccupancy of issue and new social-cultural agenda-setting``.

Through this, it makes writer`s unique color, ``Kim Su-Hyeon label Drama`` and gets a chance of making the viewers get together in front of TV. Second, hers dramas have a huge will of proofreading the public hobby and educating a specific issue.

채만식과 루쉰 지식인 소설의 풍자성 비교 연구,"Chae Man-shik and Lu Xun were both widely renowned satirists in Korea and China during the mid-modern and early contemporary periods, when both Korea and China were transitioning from premodern kingdoms to modern states, largely due to the influx of Western ideas. Both writers employed satire as a metaphorical weapon, underlining the absurdity of the societies created in both countries due to continued Japanese interference and also the utter foolishness and fatuousness of the peoples of these societies. They furthermore lamented the fact that they, despite being members of the elite, were powerless to alter the absurdity of the reality they so poignantly described. The process that led to the formation of their views regarding satire can largely be ascribed to their upbringing in their native countries and also the Western ideas they were exposed to. This paper investigates and explains the unique features of their views of satire in their literary works, mainly by analyzing their personalities and their societal backgrounds. A sample of eight novels were selected for detailed analysis, namely Chae Man Shik’s A Ready-Made Life, Tomorrow, My Innocent Uncle, and A Little Madness, and LuXun’s A Happy Family, In the Drinking House, The Misanthrope, and Sadness. By examining the manner in which satire is expressed in the aforementioned novels, certain conclusions regarding the similarities and differences between novels written by the elite, as represented by Chae Man-sik and Lu Xun, can be made. In analyzing the contents of the aforementioned novels, the types of satire analyzed were divided into two categories, namely the satire of the elite and the satire of society and the others. Similarly, in analyzing the techniques used in satires, two categories were employed, namely use of irony and tone. Through this analytical process, certain conclusions were made regarding the satire of Chae Man-shik and Lu Xun, and also the consciousness with which they faced reality.",소미 ( Wei Shao ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100473240
세계문학 - 개별성의 이해와 소통,"Herder emphasized the understanding of individuality and difference in relation to national literature, and in the process presented empathy as a solution to the problem of how the difference and individuality of the object of understanding can be understood by others in radically different situations. In other words, true understanding and communication are possible only when the understanding subject shakes off his own preconditions, and begins to see the object with their own eyes.
Goethe, who advocated the concept of world literature, was also based on this open dialogue between the self and the other. In other words, both of them understood national literature as a partial area or basic unit of world literature, and said that world literature in the true sense can be built only when each national literature has an active dialogue within the mutual relationship of harmony and complementarity. And they convinced that world literature would then not be a static concept of canon, but a dynamic reality as a process of continuous change through mutual communication between national literature.
In this context, this study looked at world literature in the sense of understanding individuality and mutual communication between national literature in terms of understanding the individuality of foreign literature and acceptance of differences, as shown by Herder and Goethe.",김완균,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879124

풍자소설과 세계문학: 식민지 시기 올더스 헉슬리의 수용 양상,"This paper analyzes the pattern of Alders Huxley’s acceptance in colonial Joseon in the 1930s. Although Huxley is now known as a ‘scientific novelist’, the discussion began with the question of whether it would have been the same way when it was first introduced. To analyze this, the following contents were reviewed. First, this paper confirmed that Huxley’s discourse occurred in the academy. The first people to introduce Huxley were English literature majors. Among them, Choi Jae-seo and Kim Young-seok were particularly prominent. The two presented academic reviews beyond introduction. Many contemporary studies were reflected in the two’s reviews, and in-depth analysis was attempted than in the previous era. The interest of English literature majors was similar in Japan. This meant that Huxley’s literature was immediately approved as ‘world literature.’ Secondly, this study scrutinizes the contextual circumstances in which Huxley was designated as a ‘satirical novelist.’ The introduction of Huxley’s literary works accentuated the post-World War I epoch, wherein cynicism and skepticism, characteristic of post-war literature, were prominently discernible in Huxley’s writings. Choi Jae-seo interprets these features as manifestations of Huxley’s ‘self-satire.’ Thirdly, the research analyzes Point Counter Point and Brave New World from the vantage point of ‘satirical novels.’ The former actively introduces a character archetype embroiled in a conflict between ‘reason’ and ‘instinct.’ Choi Jae-seo perceives the portrayal of the wandering intellectual type as reflective of ‘crippled humanity’, thereby broadening the scope of understanding English literature during the 1920s. The latter work is classified as both ‘science fiction’ and ‘satirical fiction.’ Operating on the premise that scientific progress does not guarantee human happiness, it is regarded as a cautionary tale against homogeneity and the erosion of individuality. Consequently, this study holds the significance of reconstructing the discourse that took shape within the colonial shipbuilding milieu, capturing Huxley’s arrival to critique the prevailing zeitgeist through the technique of ‘satire.’",김미연,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106364968
"음악, 라디오 그리고 프로파간다","As Hitler's National Socialists came to power in 1933, the radio, a relatively new medium at that time, was enjoyed by a limited number of people. The Nazis quickly supported the distribution of radios, so that by 1936, half of all German families had radio receivers. In addition to the speedy dissemination of receivers, the arrangement of radio programs was characteristic of Nazi broadcasting: for example, although the German army was facing defeat by 1943, Germans could hear cheerful and romantic music on their radios throughout the day(around 20 hours per day).
This study is concerned with the questions of how the Nazis effectively utilized broadcasting for their Propaganda, and how music, the modern medium of the radio, and politics were related in Nazi-Germany. The results of this study can be summarized in three points.
First, the Nazis quickly paid attention to the spread of radio receivers because music as the most important domain of German art was well suited to the listening medium of the radio.
Second, the connection of radio(a medium inseparable from modern technique) and music(the most emotional and romantic art) could reflect the inconsistent relationship between their practice and ideology: Nazis pursued technique and modernism, while also emphasizing nature, romanticism, destiny, ""Boden"" and ""Heimat"".
Third, music on the radio was directly useful for the war: radio music - including Jazz, officially banned in the Third Reich - gave pleasure to German soldiers and allowed them to relax, and it contributed to a sense of good feeling for the German civilians. Entertainment through radio music was one of the most important methods of Nazi Propaganda during WW II.",이경분,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108378113
돌봄의 선언과 자기돌봄: 돌봄 이론의 정치적 전회와 비판이론의 윤리적 전회,"This study sheds light on the ongoing debate on care in North America and the United Kingdom by examining the genre characteristics of manifestos, such as The Care Manifesto. Care is a political agenda, not only moral conduct, after care-centered feminists revisited the feminine virtue of care, and Joan Tronto published Caring Democracy (2013). During the COVID-19 pandemic, various groups of scholars and activists developed care theories and put them into practice. This paper explores the recently emerging discourse of care by analyzing two books and one article: The Care Collective’s The Care Manifesto: The Politics of Interdependence (2020), Boston Review’s The Politics of Care (2020), and “The Politics of Care” (2021) co-authored by the editors and contributors of Contemporary Political Theory.
First, this study critically reviews Joan Tronto’s Caring Democracy, which pioneered the political debate on care, and traces back to the origin of the political discussion of care and interdependence. To be more specific, this paper examines how various Declarations of Interdependence paved the way for the current debate on care. Examples include Will Durant’s “Declaration of Interdependence” (1945), Henry Steele Commager’s article (1976) with the same title, “Unanimous Declaration of Interdependence” (1968), written by local environmental activists in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Greenpeace’s “Declaration of Interdependence” (1976).
Finally, this paper addresses self-care, developed by critical theorists such as Michel Foucault, Robert Doran, and Boris Groys. Self-care is a concept that refers to the practice of creating and organizing one’s own subjectivity and agency. Such self-care, which involves the creation and organization of subjectivity and agency, can be seen as enabling the writing of the manifesto genre, as exemplified by The Care Manifesto. This genre of writing is only made possible by the practice of self-care. Therefore, this article examines self-care, which can be considered the ethical foundation of the political discourse of manifestos regarding care, and discusses the ethical turn in critical theory that has made the discussion of self-care possible.",김성희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107074594

The film reveals the global spread of capitalism by satirizing indiscriminate advertising transmitted globally through reality shows. Jean Baudrillard pointed out the deceptiveness of media-generated reality shows, which were elaborately reproduced in The Truman Show. What the The Truman Show reveals is not just the deceptiveness of the media, but also that many viewers dominated by the media remain powerless against the extreme violence it perpetrates. Truman’s awakening and actions to escape the system’s control and oppressive media demonstrates his subversive free will resulting from melancholic reflection. The film shows the confrontation between the violence committed by the media and the free will to free oneself from it is being subversive by the overcoming of melancholy imprinted in Truman.
