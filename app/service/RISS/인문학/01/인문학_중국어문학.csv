It traces the phenomenon of how affect leads to patriotism, triggered entirely by the fluctuating and uncertain future surrounding the MZ generation, the labor stress that physically pressures both minds and bodies, the anxiety arising from the difficulty of even having a place to live, political conflicts with the older generation, and the competitive relations within the MZ generation. To this end, the author first discusses the emergence, development, disjunction, and transformation of nationalism that has been socially visible and has become significant; second, instead of dichotomously differentiating Korea and China in this discussion, the author extracts the ¡®simultaneity¡¯ of the reality and generational psychology of the MZ generation in Korea and China; third, in doing so, the author offers the hypothesis of the ¡°affective patriotism¡± characterizing the nationalism of the MZ generation in Korea and China which is different from the previous generations. In elaborating the bright side and dark side of affective patriotism, the author considers its positive function in the management of self-identity and its negative function as relationship-destroying energy and argues that affective patriotism can be the basis for democratic citizenship. By reinterpreting the disgust-based nationalism in the MZ generation in Korea and China from a generational perspective, the article dissects the antagonism and prejudice in East Asia as well as the abuse of neoliberalism that lies behind them in order to draw a blueprint for a future society in which global crises are collectively addressed.",ÀÌ½ÂÈñ,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108505615

In addition, while Korean treats Metonymy, Synecdoche, Personification as typical types of figurative language, Chinese classifies similar concepts such as İïëô and ó¨ÓÛ as branches of rhetoric, different from figurative language.
Korean and Chinese classify figurative language differently because they have different perspectives on the classification criteria or the components of figurative language.

This study looked at this film again, focusing on the fact that the fifth-generation directors have dealt with subjects such as the order of father and son, paternal rights and father through various metaphors based on their common experience of the Cultural Revolution.
It is noteworthy that Feng Wanyu is the only character among the characters in which the wounds of the Cultural Revolution are exposed through the body. In particular, the wound appears as a memory impairment, and the wounds of the Cultural Revolution are not expressed in characters other than Feng Wanyu. In this respect, it can be seen that this film deliberately deletes the painful experiences of the Cultural Revolution.
Lu Yanshi still exerts the power of paternity in this family, even though he has been absent for a long time due to the Cultural Revolution. Although Lu Yanshi was truly unable to return home due to his wife""s disability, his letter became the voice of father and played a key role in the functioning of this family. In addition, his portrayal of characters close to perfect personality gives legitimacy for re-establishing the order of father and son, and this private paternity exerts stronger power than public paternity.
Dandan, a generation of Red Guards, participated in the murder of her father during the period of the Cultural Revolution, but rather, she unexpectedly became a victim. After that, Dandan was able to return home through her father""s forgiveness, and Dandan, who used to be a sub-subject, can stand again as a complete subject through the reconstruction of the order of father and son.
These characters can be divided into generations of parents and sons, and the fact that the wounds and healing methods of these generations are described differently can reveal a new perception of the Cultural Revolution of the fifth-generation director.","±Çµµ°æ(Kwon, Do-Kyung)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107962347

¡®Guo (Î¦)¡¯ and ¡®un cek-i iss (Àº ÀûÀÌ ÀÖ)¡¯ share most features of experiential aspect markers, so we can say that both ¡®guo (Î¦)¡¯ and ¡®un cek-i iss (Àº ÀûÀÌ ÀÖ)¡¯ are experiential markers.

Apart from the development of events in the movie, it frequently exposes the Five-star Red Flag, which symbolizes China, and reminds the audience of China's status through repeated lines related to China.

Digital textbooks refer to textbooks developed to enable learning based on digital devices, including related digital learning materials and learning support functions, in addition to existing e-books. Representative examples of digital textbooks used in Korea can be seen as digital textbooks currently used in elementary, middle, and high schools. The development and use of digital textbooks in elementary and secondary education is a global trend, and the digitization of elementary and secondary education textbooks is expected to cause the digitization of university textbooks in the near future.
Except for digital textbooks in elementary, middle, and high schools, digital textbooks are largely divided into two types. There is a method of requesting the production of digital textbooks to a developer based on book-type textbooks, and a method of making digital textbooks directly by instructors through an online platform. In the case of classes where the instructor¡¯s subject continuity is guaranteed, the number of students or classes is small, and all students can use digital textbooks, the instructor can directly create digital textbooks suitable for the subject through the platform and provide them to students. On the other hand, if the continuity of the instructor¡¯s subject is not guaranteed and several classes are taught with the same textbook, it is safe and efficient to use digital textbooks provided by developers based on book-type textbooks. For each Chinese subject at each university, it is necessary to select a development type suitable for the characteristics of each subject.",ÃÖ½ÅÇı ( Choi Shinhye ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106069456

The reason for the ¡®ùÚùÛÖµ¡¯ is that it is exploiting ¡®culture¡¯ as a means of international politics. The thesis is aimed at critically reviewing the effectiveness of the ¡®ùÚùÛÖµ¡¯ in the two major aspects of the foreign cultural policy, namely, ¡®Cultural Security and Soft Power¡¯ pursued by the Chinese government in the 21st century.
In terms of cultural security, ¡®ùÚùÛÖµ¡¯ seems to have failed to gain a significant effect. In terms of the ideological aspects of cultural security, in terms of cultural identity, ¡®ùÚùÛÖµ¡¯ has been an effective policy tool. Through official or informal channels, Hallyu contents continued to circulate throughout China. Chinese¡¯s interest in hallyu also showed little difference compared to the mere past. Also, the economic aspect of the content industry is not too big for the overall economic aspect of the economy.
On the other hand, in the soft power aspect of the Chinese foreign policy keynote, Especially in terms of improving the nation¡¯s image, only the ¡®ùÚùÛÖµ¡¯ has led to the worst results. Regarding the future of Korea and China relations in the future, Far too many Koreans have begun to regard China as a rival or threat rather than a partner. Far too many Koreans chose America rather than China as a more important country in the future. However, the result was a completely contrary situation just a year ago.
It seems that China¡¯s foreign policy, which was viewed through only ¡®ùÚùÛÖµ¡¯ is facing a curious dilemma. The Chinese government still recognizes ¡®culture¡¯ in terms of direct national interests, The Chinese government aggressively pushes ahead with inroads into Chinese culture, while imposing sanctions on foreign cultures. The Chinese government¡¯s foreign policy can be recognized as another ¡®hegemony¡¯ in the international community.","±Ç±â¿µ(Kwon, Ki-Young)",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106339966

The specific contents are about the humanistic implies ofthe numbers ¡®0 and 1¡¯. I describe it into three parts as follows: ¨ç Many interpretations ofhumanistic math about ¡®0 and 1¡¯ which could be extended to the circle and wave in TaiJI(÷¼Ğ¿)and its center line and its augural meaning of differential equation; probability; set in regard toGeorge Cantor¡¯s diagonal argument; and exponential function and log function which are relatedwith the concept of information bit. ¨è A comparison of information theory about ¡®0 and 1¡¯ indigital computer¡¯s bit with quantum computer¡¯s qbit. ¨é Mathematical semiotics of Yin and Yangin Book of Change(Yi-Jing), and Laozhuang¡¯s view of ¡®liangxing(Õ×ú¼)¡¯, i.e. going two-wayssimultaneously from the aspect of information theory.
In this paper I maintain 3 points as follows:¡¡¨Í Similarity of ambivalence(å»Ê¤àõ) between 0that includes nothing and infinity and concept of ¡®Wu¡¯(Ùí) in Laozi(ÒÇí­). ¨Î digital computer¡¯soperating system is alternative algorithm i.e. {0/1}. Meanwhile quantum computer is simultaneouslyambivalent taking algorithm i.e. {0&1}, which is based on quantum superposition and quantumentanglement. In other words, digital computer is based on the way of optional choice, andquantum computer runs in two different ways simultaneously. I think quantum computer¡¯s operatingsystem is much similar to the process of ¡°Yang from Yin(ëäñéåÕ)¡± and ¡°Yin from Yang(åÕñéëä)¡±in YiJing(æ¶Ìè), which is operated in intrinsically mutual complementary way. ¨Ï For hundreds ofyears Western thoughts made much of rational clarity, and in result the thoughts of ambivalence¡¯(å»Ê¤àõ) in East Asian traditional thoughts are neglected relatively.
I think from the impact of Einstein¡¯s Relative Theories and Quantum Mechanics in earlydecades of 20th century, people start ringing that rational clarity is not always superior toambivalence and ambiguity, especially in modern science.

Young people share and deliver the contents of the drama in real time while watching web dramas, and present personal opinions. In the information age, the rapid spread of information can be said to be an excellent promotion effect above all else. Therefore, for the growth of Chinese web dramas in the future, it is necessary to reflect the needs of young people. In addition, I think that if Chinese webtoons are re-mediated rather than simply retransmitting existing TV dramas or overseas contents in web dramas, they will be able to increase both their ratings and satisfaction.
Improving satisfaction with young people can also be of great help in promoting web dramas. If young people's satisfaction with web dramas increases, it will naturally promote web dramas to other classes, and eventually, the web drama market will be expanded further than now.",±¸°æ¸ğ,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108043932

The Study of Chinese Literature in U.S.A was started in 1930's. It grew up gradully in 1970's and 1980's. There were more than ten major books and many articles in this area in 1990's. Before 1990's, the major subject was on the study of Ban Zhao(Úìá¹), Cai Yan(óùæü), Yu Xuanji(åàúÜÑ¦), Xue Tao(ààÔ¦), Li Qingzhao(ì°ôèğÎ) etc. However in 1990's, it concentrated on the women's literature of Ming and Qing dynasty, especially Qing dynasty. On the whole, the amount of the study on the women's literature in Ming and Qing dynasty is abundant. It is caused by the changing of Ming and Qing dynasty. The social position of women was better than before, and the consciousness of women was changed in Ming and Qing dynasty. And the materials are remaining abundantly.
The method of study can be said in these ways. First, the analysis on the anthor and text(works) by feminism. Second, the analysis by the consideration on the context, for example political, social, economic and cultural environment. Third, the adaptation of modern feminism theory. Fourth the comparison between the novels on the main theme like as relationship of man and woman.
The study of Chinese Women's literature in U.S.A shows us some reflection and developmental idea. Someday we need to rewrite new history of Chinese literatre by fill up 'herstory' of Chinese women's literature with our own power and language.",×³óãÎã,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108381064
