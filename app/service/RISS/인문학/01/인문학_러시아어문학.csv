Since its founding, Russia and the Russian people have made great efforts to solidify Russian language as a means of combating illiteracy, spreading communism around the world, and expanding and preserving its function and role as the most basic means of inter-ethnic communication for Soviet Union, made up of more than 130 ethnic groups,
After the official dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, President Putin created and operated a foundation called Ruskij Mir Fond in June 2007 to develop and disseminate Russian language and culture.
It is clear that Russians, Russian-speaking residents, and the justification for Russian protection in Ukraine are clearly one important cause of this military operation. The consequences of the Russo-Ukraine war are hard to predict, but if Russia fails to achieve its goals, it will have a significant impact on the international status of the Russian language, which plays a corresponding role in the post-Soviet space.",정경택,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108186195
서방의 대 러시아 에너지 부문 제재와 러시아의 대응,"Energy industry sanctions, which form the core of economic sanctions against Russia, began in earnest after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Following the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022, the US and EU significantly strengthened sanctions on the energy industry, which is the backbone of Russia's economy and accounts for more than 50% of its exports. Russia is not only Europe's No. 1 supplier of energy resources, but also occupies a very important position in world energy trade, accounting for 20% of total global trades of energy commodities. Political conflicts between major exporters and importers such as Russia, the US and Europe have greatly increased uncertainties in the energy market. This is having a huge impact on the world economy. As a result of the sanctions, the Russian energy industry has been forced to change its structure. If the previous goal was to develop the energy industry and further strengthen its position as the largest exporter of natural resources, the current goal has to be revised to minimize losses caused by sanctions.
In the future, Russia is expected to increase exports to the Asian market, focusing on cooperation with China and India. It is expected that costs will increase because productivity and efficiency decrease as access to foreign technology and equipment becomes difficult. The policy to localize Western equipment and technology subject to sanctions will be pushed more strongly, but this will inevitably cost considerable money and time. At present, Russia's exports of energy regenerate maintain a high export value due to high prices, although the export volume has decreased. It is difficult for Europe to fully replace Russian energy resources in the short term. For the time being, due to increased exports to Asia and relatively high energy commodity prices, Russia's energy resource exports are expected to remain high for a considerable period of time. The Russian energy industry will play an important role in the Russian economy and international energy market for some time, but its current share will decline more rapidly than previously anticipated. In an unprecedented and unpredictable situation, the Russian energy industry is facing a previously unimaginable challenge to maintain the status quo or to minimize the decline in production and exports.",성진석,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108244557
청주시 거주 러시아어권 이주민 현황과 과제,"This paper specifically examines the residency status of Russian-speaking immigrants, including the ethnic Korean diaspora, living in Cheongju City. Throughout this study, it addresses several challenges related to immigrant settlement and social integration. Among foreign nationals of ethnic descent, there has been a noticeable shift in the last five years. The proportion of Chinese and American nationals among foreign compatriots has declined, while there is an increasing trend in the number of diaspora from Central Asian countries, particularly ethnic Koreans from Russia. If the foreigner-to-total population ratio exceeds 5%, it is commonly acknowledged that the country has transitioned into a multicultural society. By this standard, our society could also be described as multicultural. As of March 2023, the number of registered Russian-speaking immigrants residing in Cheongju City was recorded at 6,435. Considering the fact that around 20% of domestic foreigners are unregistered, it is estimated that there are approximately 7,700 residents with Russian-speaking backgrounds, including ethnic Koreans, in Cheongju City.
The attraction of foreign immigrant populations in the era of low birth rates and an aging society has become an inevitable reality, leading to active discussions even about the establishment of an immigration agency. For the rapidly increasing Russian-speaking immigrant community in Cheongju City, individually tailored support measures have now reached a stage of review and reevaluation. Urgent efforts are needed to establish a Task Force (TF) consisting of relevant government and private organizations, including Cheongju City Hall, Chungbuk Provincial Office, Immigration Office, Education Office, universities, and the Small and Medium Business Association. Comprehensive information gathering and extensive network-building for Russian-speaking immigrants residing in Cheongju City should also be pursued, based on collaborative research in the fields of sociology, geography, and humanities. It is essential for the culture of Cheongju City, South Korea, to mature into a harmonious and mutually beneficial coexistence with the cultures of Russian-speaking immigrants, and this requires the collective attention and endeavors of all of us.",김태옥,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108536399

‘붉은 인간’의 전쟁: 스베틀라나 알렉시예비치 5부작과 러시아혁명,"2015 winner of the Nobel prize in Literature, Svetlana Alexievich’s cycle “Voices of Utopia,” which consists of five parts are a grandiose study of Soviet life. The sufferings of Homo Sovieticus who has been learning capitalism for more than 20 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union are the focus of Alexievich’s attention. This article explores the traces of the Russian Revolution, figured in Alexisevich’s “novels of voices.” Main leitmotives that penetrate Alexievich’s five prose volumes are “red man” and wars(World War II, Soviet-Afgan War and Chernobyl ‘war’ on nuclear power). Before examining red man’s wars which had a profound impact on the formation of Soviet people’s mentality, we should first review the controversy among Russian literary critics from the standpoint of lack of literary value in Alexievich’s novels after she received the Nobel Prize. The author persistingly recalls the voices of women and children who were forgotten in the war narrative, filled with men’s voices. Through the testimony of disadvantaged group, the steady voice of the author opposing the war is conveyed. Finally, At the end of the experiment of the Communist revolution, which left only the wounds of war, we should listen to the voice of the author appealing to explore the new philosophy and new ethics necessary for the post-Soviet society, living in the “Second Hand time” still again.",심지은,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108186141
『안나 카레니나』에 나타난 안나와 레빈의 상반된 운명,"Tolstoy’s two major protagonists in “Anna Karenina”, Anna and Levin, exist as the reflection of writer’s ego. Whereas Anna lost everything and met her death, Levin experienced the spiritual growth and found happiness. The discrepancy between the ending of Anna’s and Levin’s destiny results from the difference of directivity in one’s
life. Anna who went astray drove herself toward destruction, while Levin who went in the right direction turned to God and was reborn as a new person. In determining two contrastive destiny, ‘moral law’ and ‘reason’ played significant roles. Thus, by tracing the interrelationship between the directly-opposed fates of Anna and Levin and the idea of

In this paper, by comparing the causes, development patterns, and methods of overcoming feelings of inferiority, ultimately, Tolstoy tried to reveal the message that Tolstoy throws through the feelings of inferiority in the two main characters.
The cause of Anna's inferiority complex is her negative vision of herself, and she decides to commit suicide in order to get revenge on the object that gave her such a negative vision. Not only that, she distorts her relationship and life because of her inferiority complex. On the other hand, Levin does not cling to the object or situation that caused him to feel inferior, but goes to the community to overcome his negative self, discovers the truth of life through spiritual awakening, and leads a different life than before. In the novel, Tolstoy emphasizes that in order to deny self-denial through the attitudes of the two main characters towards the sense of inferiority and to move on to the path of self-innovation, it is necessary to start from the ontological dimension of inferiority and move on to the axiological dimension of inferiority.",조혜경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76178918

This class model, which is designed to promote self-directed learning of class participants and broaden the horizon of understanding of students related to humanities classics and humanities, focuses on the cases of 《Anna Karenina》and 《Tristan and Isolde》, which are considered to be representative Western bibles and still have room for new interpretation from today's point of view, and thus can lead to various problems and active discussions.

러시아어 도구-주어문에 대한 소고: [원인]으로서 도구-주어를 중심으로,"This paper examines instrument-subject alternation as a type of oblique subject alternation. Diverging from the typical subject as an animate referent with volition, instrument-subjects have intrigued many researchers. Instrument-subject alternation refers to cases in which the instrument argument is realized in the subject position when it is assigned the instrumental case in an agent-subject construction. The instrument-subject can be divided into the cause of the process and the possessor of the property. They are each given the semantic roles of [Cause] and [Theme].
This study investigates the instrument-subject as [Cause]. Instrument-subject construction lowers the saliency of the agent and puts high saliency on the instrument. In this regard, certain constraints are placed on the instrument argument and the verb. Instruments that have relatively high visibility, automaticity, and mobility easily permit the syntactic promotion and cannot be combined with verbs that connote clear intentionality. Besides, events with instrument-subject constructions indicate a preferred interpretation of the resulting state rather than that of the agent-oriented process. Accordingly, the instrument-subject tends to combine with the perfective result verb among complex verbs consisting of the process and the state.
Further in this paper, the relationship between constructions with a lower saliency of agent is discussed, i.e. the indefinite-personal construction, passive, impersonal transitive, anti-causative construction, and instrument-subject construction. Among them, agent-subject constructions and the impersonal transitive in which the syntactic position of the agent clearly exists emphasize the interpretation of the process, whereas other constructions in which this is uncertain lay emphasis on the result state.",남혜현,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82640000
러시아어 욕설 연구,"This essay is to examine the abusive words and lots of foul languages which comes from the bad ones which Russians often use in their everyday life. Whereas there are not many words for bad ones in Korean language, there are a lot of words for coarse language or profanity. Actually, there are more abusive words in Russian than in any other language. The bad words and their derivational foul or coarse language in Russian are very commonly spoken in their speech. Though the insulting words are not generally considered desirable, the very ones sometimes play an important in showing off or developing their close friendship among friends. They say that the Russians might sometimes feel cathartic experience by seeing or hearing someone calls anyone all his names. In this respect, even the aesthetic appeal is sometimes focused on of a lot of different swear words in Russian.

러시아 성경적 관용어의 의미변화 유형 및 특징에 관한 연구,"The purpose of this paper is to classify the interrelationships between original Bible text and biblical idioms by type. And I want to reveal the meaning change and its cause and characteristic in Russian biblical idioms. For this, I used three classification methods: Contextual/ situational biblical idioms, Directly/ indirectly quoted biblical idioms, Direct/ reinterpreted biblical idioms.
In Russian biblical idioms, contextual biblical idioms are observed more often than situational idioms, and most of the biblical idioms are from the directly biblical idioms, and the indirectly biblical idiom is very rare. One of the greatest features of Russian biblical idioms is that the reinterpreted biblical idiom accounts for about 70% of the data used in the analysis.
The factors that affected the meaning change of biblical idioms were the Desacralization, the Change of speech style, the Contextual and literal interpretation of the Bible text, the Increase in negative meaning, and the Addition of Russian vocabulary and semantic elements.",박현지,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104302975
내적 타자의 다면성: 최신 러시아 영화에 나타난 북극 토착민의 시각화,"There is an apparent trend that indigenous peoples living in Russian Arctic have recently been visualized in both Russian documentary and feature films.

The first three films, among others, have been thoroughly analyzed and highly admired through various themes and motifs both in Russia and in other countries. On the contrary, there has been little research to date on the film White Moss which for the first time in Russian film history visualizes a story of Nenets people living in Yamal region above the Arctic Circle.

미국의 대러 제재가 러시아 경제에 미친 영향,"This article aims to examine the impact of the US sanctions against Russia in 2014. Are there the real impacts of the broad-scale sanctions against Russia, led by the US, on the Russian economy? To solve this problem, this study analyzed the effect of sanctions on macroeconomic and financial indicators from 2014 to 2019, as well as to examine the effects of sanctions on the implementation of large-scale energy projects in Russia.
U.S. sanctions against Russia, which began in 2014, were first imposed on government officials, businessmen and entrepreneurs, and have been expanded to include such sectors as energy, defense industry and finance, Russia""s major industrial sectors. In addition, U.S. sanctions against Russia were basically targeted at Americans or corporations in the U.S., but secondary sanctions were implemented that could also be subject to sanctions for foreigners or foreign corporations. The enforcement of these secondary sanctions has made it difficult for investment cooperation between Russian and foreign companies.
According to the study, US sanctions have affected fluctuations in exchange rates in the short term. In addition, it is estimated that it has affected the inflow of foreign direct investment and the financial market such as stock index, CDS premium, and government bond yields.
US sanctions against Russia also affected the real economy. The enforcement of sanctions against Russia has also suspended plans for participation by foreign companies in energy projects. In addition, it recently affected the construction of the Nordstream-2 gas pipeline, which supplies natural gas from Russia to Europe.
Therefore, it can be said that US sanctions against Russia are affecting macroeconomic and financial markets on the one hand, and energy development projects on the other hand. If the US sanctions against Russia continue in the future, it is expected to have a negative impact on the Russian economy along with the global economic depression and lower oil prices.","조영관(Jo, Young Kwan)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108731393
내용언어통합 교수법을 기반으로 한 러시아 역사 수업 연구*,"A teaching method that has recently been attracting attention in learning a second foreign language is a content-language integrated learning method based on a cognitive linguistics point of view. Content and language integration learning method is a type of content-based teaching method. It is a method of integrating language education in the process of learning non-linguistic subjects rather than taking full charge of language education in language classes. Content and language integration teaching enables efficient use of time by teaching two subjects at the same time, develops cognitive and language skills at the same time, and facilitates expression in a foreign language by using the learned vocabulary for communication. It is receiving positive evaluations from many researchers in that it is easy to learn, increases learning motivation, and understands the way of thinking and cultural values of the people of the language. However, in Korea, it is being actively studied in English and Korean language education for foreigners, and there is little application in second foreign language education including Russian. Therefore, in this study, a Russian-based history class model was proposed. There are various teaching methods depending on whether the content-language integrated teaching method focuses on the content or the language, but in this study, the class was designed based on the CALLA model that balances the content and language. This study is meaningful in that it suggests a new teaching method that can approach the two goals of knowledge and language development in the reality of undergraduate second foreign language education where pure language classes are gradually reduced and various convergence subjects are created. In addition, it is meaningful in that it suggests the possibility that even non-native speakers can effectively conduct non-linguistics classes based on foreign languages if they use textbooks, various auxiliary materials, and effective learning strategies suitable for the learner's level.",유정화,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108055176
N. 레스코프의 소설 <왼손잡이>에 나타난 신조어와 사회적 방언 연구,"Nikolai Leskov's novel <Lefty>, published in 1881, as can be seen from the subtitle, “The Tale of the Lefty and Steel Flea in the Tula region.” It is a story about a genius russian blacksmith, who put heels on steel flea’s shoes, which is a product of British science and Nano-art technology. M. Gorky evaluated Nikolai Leskov as a ‘magician of language’, who secured an independent position in the history of Russian literature with a realistic russian people's language, comparable to Tolstoy and other masters of Russian literature. In fact, Leskov helped his relative’s business and traveled all over Russia, deeply understood life in Russian villages and the language of the people. Leskov's works are recognized as difficult to translate due to his unique style and social dialects with strong local colors. Therefore, the study of the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of Leskov's work, who is praised as the most peculiar russian writer, will help to understand the russian language and culture of the Russian public and furthermore, understand the structure of consciousness and worldview of Russians. Leskov's representative work <Lefty> is a so-called ‘Leskov lexicon’. He composed various word-combination and neologisms for new conceptions, which has no reference and no notions. Despite the fact that <Lefty> has a novel form, the author himself named a ‘story(skaz)’ through the narrative form of ‘storytelling’ by putting the narrative narrator (storyteller) in the foreground and separating Leskov's own author's narrative. It is stylistic strategy to give probabilities and realism of the narrative. Leskov intentionally gives the impression that it is not fictitious made-up story. In the contrasting position of Alexander I, who believed in Western civilization’s superiority, and Nicholas I, who believed in the superiority of Russians, Leskov represents the confrontation of the ambivalent conceptions, such as ‘Westernism and Slavism’, ‘rationalism and sentimentalism’, ‘left and right’, and ‘reason and faith’. As a symbol of Russian people, <Lefty> has great implications. This study illuminates the Russian soul and mentality based on the study of neologisms and social dialects appearing in the work <Lefty> by Nikolai Leskov, the most peculiar russian writer in the history of Russian literature, who occupies an independent position in the history of Russian literature.",백경희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530570
러시아 국가-자본관계의 변화,"State-business relations in Russia experienced tumultuous changes over the last two decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union. During the 1990s the business sector enjoyed privileges coupled with substantial influence over political and social issues, overshadowing the state in the country. In contrast, during the 2000s the state regained control over business elites particularly with a firm grip over the energy sector.
Focusing on three cases, this paper analyzes dynamic features of state-business relations in the oil industry in Russia. In the first case, where ‘spontaneous privatization’ took place during the late 1980s and early 1990s under weak state power, a handful of political and economic elites made coalitions to take away huge state assets for their own private interest. Then came another round of privatization, in which a few oligarchs obtained blue-chip state firms at excessively low prices. The Yukos affair of 2003~2004 constitutes the second case for the state-business relations. This paper argues that the Yukos affair is a result of clash between political elites with statist orientation and oligarchs with some political influence. In the aftermath of the Yukos affair, in the third case, most business elites became more accommodative toward the Kremlin, while seeking for various survival strategies including vertical integration and internationalization of business.",장덕준(Chang Duckjoon),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108536395
러시아의 민족 언어 지원정책 분석연구: 소련의 민족 언어 평등정책과의 비교를 중심으로,"Through globalization, the whole world is folding into a multicultural era. This era has escaped the current country’s and nation’s frame, and while experiencing a new form of social and cultural disputes, it has faced realistic problems such as racial conflicts, alienation, and discrimination. Especially in multi-ethnic countries, the conflicts within the nation are deepening and becoming more complex than in the past. Therefore, the national policy enforcement within the multi-ethnic country is becoming the core key word for the unity, maintenance, and improvement of the country. A Correct and efficient national policy enforcement could be the cornerstone of the multi-ethnic country; however, the regressive national policy could also threaten or dismantle the country, becoming its key of existence or destruction. And the ethnic-language policy plays a core role in that national policy. Ethnical identity can be defined as one’s individual’s feeling of belonging to a specific nation due to the shared national characteristic. The ethnic Language is the essential tool to maintain and achieve the national characteristic. The ethnic language is the nation’s representative symbol, and through the language, the national culture and identity are inherited. Therefore, the next generation’s ethnic language’s communication ability will become the benchmark for judging the national identity’s continuation. The sum of all formal management and administrative measures relating to the ethnic language is called ethnic language policy. The analysis research of the ethnic language policy is an indicator understanding the national policy’s identity aimed by the nation. As a scale that predicts the direction of the continuation of the national policy, the analysis research is massive in its value. This analysis research of the Russian ethnic language policy puts the analysis of the Russian government’s support policy for non-Slavic ethnic groups in Russia as its core. However, this analysis does not only review the efficiency of the Russian government’s ethnic language policy. Through the transition point in time of when Russia has truly entered the multi-cultural society, we will examine the identity and the direction of the Russian ethnic language policy. According to the policy’s identity and direction, the future of the Russian multi-cultural society’s future may change. This research is an analysis research using the collected documentary records to find differences between the Russian ethnic language support policy and the Soviet Union’s ethnic language equality policy. Firstly, through the analytic background from the times of the Soviet Union to modern Russia, the basic operation is grasping the diachronic approach method of the contents of the ethnic language policy. Through these kinds of processes, the analysis of the causes and basic characteristics of the Soviet Union’s and Russian ethnic language policy towards non-Slavic ethnic group took place. Later, using both the Soviet’s ethnic language equality policy and the research frame called the comparative analysis, the identity, limitations, and the objectives of selected analysis target, the ethnic language support policy (Core analysis policy: multi-lingual permit policy and the native language education support policy) was sought out. The policy comparison isn’t the differences between the advantages or the disadvantages. Using the analysis of the similarities and the differences, instead of the efficiency of the policy, the analysis revealing the character of the policy is considered as the core of the policy comparison.",전병국,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105121174

러시아 자본주의의 형성과 발전,"This paper aims to analyze distinctive characteristics and nature of Russian capitalism under the assumption that Russian economy has been evolved into the direction towards capitalism since it began its transition to a market economy. In chapter 2, it is investigated the background of the formation of Russian-style capitalism through analyzing the Russian transition strategies, outcomes, and their realities since 1992. In chapter 3, we intend to investigate the most distinctive feature of Russian capitalism, i.e. dependence on oil and gas, and emphasize deeply-rooted dependence on oil and gas sector, which would be not only a lasting strength but also a significant weakness for Russian capitalism. In chapter 4, changing features of oligarchic capitalism in Yeltsin""s era and state capitalism in Putin""s era are examined with the emphasis on state-business relations. In conclusion, some important features and preliminary prospects for the future development of Russian capitalism are summarized on the basis of above analysis.
At present, Russian economy, having experienced a great shock once again due to the global financial crisis in 2009, is in the stage to strengthen stability of the capitalist system of a market economy rather than to resolve the challenges of further transition. As is situated in these conditions, Russia cannot only replicate the institutional merits of other advanced capitalist countries. Being still not freed from the legacies of the past system, it may be more appropriate for Russia the state-led corporatistic capitalist system rather than the Anglo-American capitalist system for its developing institutions and organizational forms. Broad consensus has been formed among internal and external scholars that the efforts in Yeltsin""s era to replicate Anglo-American capitalist system upon the ruins of old system yielded unproductive results. Hence, for the future of Russian capitalism, Russia should not only take advantage of the assets left from past system but also rest on them.","김영진(Kim, Young Jin)",2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108055177

존재의 의미: 『안나 카레니나』 8부 재조명,"The eighth and final part of Anna Karenina has been regarded idiosyncratic for the absence of the heroine and its heavily philosophical treatment of Levin`s contemplations. Moreover, the anti-war sentiment toward the Russo-Turkish war ignited a heated discussion upon its publication. Against the background of these reservations, this paper aims at defending Part Eight by examining its critical role in the novel. Part Eight is not devoid of the eponymous heroine as her presence is as powerful as before, given the impact of her memory on Vronsky. Her legacy as the revengeful judge is finalized and hereby Anna`s opposition to Levin is also finalized. Their contrast stands out in Levin`s interior monologue, a counterpart to Anna`s in Part Seven. Levin`s monologue spells out what drives Anna to self-destruction, while Levin survives the tormenting doubts about life. Unlike Anna, Levin does not fall prey to the swindling of reason. Along this line, the theme of war serves as a platform to disclose the hypocrisy pervasive in the society. In the end, it is significant that the final part of the novel ends in Levin`s family happiness, embracing individual, social and family dimensions, and thereby marking an appropriate finale to the novel dealing with happy as well as unhappy families.",윤새라 ( Sae Ra Yoon ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108530562

Драма Александра Блока ≪Король на площади≫ знаменует собой один из значимых сдвигов как в драматургии Блока, так и в его творчестве в целом. Она является важным пунктом в ≪трилогии вочеловечения≫. Если в ≪Балаганчике≫ Блок изображал мнимый, нежизнеспособный мир запертого современного символистского искусства, то в драме ≪Король на площади≫, написанной на фоне особенно острого ощущения современных жизненных событий, ставится вопрос о жизнеспособности современного искусства в непосредственном столкновении с реальностью. ≪Король на площади≫, зародившись в разгаре бушующей революционной действительности, инсценирует глубокие размышления Блока о своем месте в жизни, о месте современной поэзии в столкновении с жизненной действительностью. Тема драмы ? о внутреннем противоречии современного поэта, который не в силах принять саму действительность, и о парадоксе современного искусства, неспособного преображать жизнь. Тема дихотомии жизни и искусства воспроизводится в сквозной теме разрушения высокой мечты, вовлекающей различные вариации на тему падения символистского мифа о Вечной Женственности, о крушении символистской поэзии, о слабости поэта-символиста. Констатируя нежизнеспособность современной поэзии, Блок выводит на первый план тему о падении современной поэзии, о ее крушении в столкновении с жизнью. Непосредственное столкновение Поэта с событиями современной действительности, его обостренное их переживание ускоряет процесс саморефлексии. В этом смысл реальности в драме ≪Король на площади≫. Введением моментов жизненной реальности ? моментов стихии и хаоса, в том числе безумия поэтических слов, ≪Король на площади≫ становится отправным пунктом переосмысления представлений и о современном искусстве и о символистских мифах.",차지원,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76178977
1950년대 사할린 조선순회극단 연구 - 러시아국립문학예술문서보관소(РГАЛИ) 자료에 기초하여 -,"This paper is a research on the formation and early movements of the “Sakhalin Touring Company(Корейский Южно-Сахалинский обла стной передвижной драматический театр)”, organized at Southern Sakhalin in 1948. The file about the Sakhalin Touring Company of the Russian national record center in Moscow is the main source of this article. Records about theater companies during the 1940’s to 50’s are made up of pictures and scripts. Among those, It is hard to find studies about the Sakhalin Touring Company. Therefore, this article was written based on records, not researched, nor opened to the academic world, which gives the paper academic value.
The Sakhalin Touring Company quickly settled and developed due to support and participation of the North Korean, and Russian Korean art experts. In the late 1950’s it became a professional theatrical troupe, performing more than a hundred times a year. Not only Korean traditional plays like 『Hong-Gil-Dong』 or 『Heungbu and Nolbu』, but also original plays like 『The Doctor』 or 『Tiger Swallowtail』 were performed with dramatizations and creations.
The document from the Russian national record center about the Sakhalin Touring Company is now assumed to be obtained by the National Archives of Korea. But, since not even the inventory is open to the public, it is difficult for researchers to access. The documents should be open for advanced research on the Touring Company.","배은경(Bae, Eun-Kyung)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106400579
제2차 세계대전 시기 소련의 전쟁 포스터에 나타난 여성의 이미지,"During the Second World War the Soviet Union was quite seriously damaged by the German armies, and yet it turned the tide of the war and eventually defeated Germany. The fact that the Soviet Union succeeded in waging total war even more efficiently than the enemy accounts for its miraculous victory over Germany. The total war on the part of the Soviet Union can be characterized by the mobilization of women and arts for the war effort. To be sure, other belligerent nations made attempts for total war like the Soviet Union. But their attempts for total war did not reach the level of the total war waged by the Soviet Union. The unprecedented extent and depth with which the Soviet Union mobilized women and arts for its war effort were reflected in the fact that the Soviet women appeared frequently on the wartime posters on which a great deal of stress was put by the wartime leadership. Images of the Soviet women in posters can be classified into four the categories: 1) women as allegory of “Mother Russia”, 2) women as war victims, 3) women as workforce in the rear, and 4) women as soldiers. The various roles played by the Soviet women during the Great Patriotic War were reflected more or less fairly in wartime posters. But the Soviet wartime posters had a tendency to distort the important reality that the Soviet women do their part in war effort as combatants for the whole period of the war. Quite interestingly, women combatants were not depicted in virtually all the posters. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the dichotomous conception of gender roles: men as warriors and women as peace-keepers. The images of active women combatants attacking enemy ran counter unfailingly to those of passive women conceived by male Soviet soldiers and citizens.",류한수(Lyu Han-Su),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107083963
러시아 형식주의 : 혁명적 문학이론의 기원,"Тhe purpose of this paper is to reexamine the legacy of Russian formalism not only as one of the most groundbreaking theoretical systems from the last century but also in terms of a characteristic original point for revolutionary literary theory itself. While retrospectively looking back at its short but intense trajectory of development with the background of Bolshevik Revolution in Russia 100 years ago, we intend to underscore the multifaceted ways that representative theorists of formalism had disappeared from the historical stage of revolution, that is, ending scenery(/scenario) of formalism, alongside with the well-known high-profile appearance of Russian formalism. From the perspective of today, what is more interesting than the actual historical path of formalism is the alternative route that it could have gone, but had not stepped on, so-called “unexplored possibilities” of formalism. Origin is a point of `exceptional openness` in which pluralities of potentialities to be manifested later are ejected at once. Russian formalism is offered to us today as that kind of origin for revolutionary literary theory, namely the first place where `fundamental questions` about literature have been raised for the first time. Just like the Russian Revolution did when it happened exactly 100 years ago.",김수환,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76178914
러시아-벨라루스 관계와 우크라이나 전쟁,"The on-going Russian-Ukrainian War has critically changed world politics and economy, as well as the relations among three Slavic nations. Observers and analysts have cited various reasons for the Russian-Ukrainian War, which started in February, 2022, but they did not pay much attention to the fact that Belarus’s political and military subjugation to Russia was the one of main factors which played an important role in Russia’s decision to launch a whole-scale war aiming at the conquest of the whole territory of Ukraine, including its capital, Kyiv. Many scholars argue that the expansion of NATO has seriously jeopardized the security of Russia and Russia’s so-called “special military operaton,” is the legitimate response to this challenge to the vital interests of Russia, However the process of war and Russia’s war plan have showed that the establishment of Russia-led East Slavic union is the ultimate aim of this war. The fact that, after the 2020 domestic crisis, Belarus became virtually Russia’s client state allowed Russia to set up an audacious plan to occupy the whole territory of Ukraine in a short period of time and henceforth Russia invaded Kviv from the Belarussian border without much preparations and failed to capture Kyiv. Without the subjugation of Belarus, Russia might have set up a military plan to occupy Donbass region and southern corridor connecting Donbass to Crimea as Russia’s current war efforts show. This study examines the history of Russia-Belarus relations since 1991 up to 2022. After listing the causes of the current war, it shows that the most critical precipitating cause for Russia’s whole-scale war was Belarus’s political and military subjugation to Russia. As for prospects for future relations between Russia and Belarus, if the war go on without clear victor, Belarus would remains as serving military base for Russia. If Russia fail to win the war and a regime change take place in Russia and Lukashenko’s regime might also face the similar fate.",허승철,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108186139
러시아어권 한국어 학습자의 오류 분석,"This study is devoted to analyze the written errors by Kazakhstan Eurasian university students at the beginner’s and intermediate stages, to whom Russian is just like a native language and korean is a target language, and propose effective foreign language teaching method to the Korean and Russian teachers and learners.
Contrastive Analysis shows us the differences between the structures of native language and those of a target language, and explain the errors made by the second language learners through the interference of native language. In addition to this the learner’s interlanguage, which is made by overgeneralization, incomplete application of rules, ignorance of rule restriction, and false concepts hypothesized, shows not only learners’ errors, but also systematic learning stages.
Through the error analysis, based on contrastive analysis and interlanguage, the 5 major error types are proposed here, which are Coalescence, One-to-one correspondence, Absent category, New category, Differentiation, and Similar but different category, we can find the causes of learners’ errors, further expect them in advance in the language teaching process and give guidance to minimize the Russian and korean learners’ errors.",박혜옥,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103948840
"시베리아 원주민들의 죽음 문화 : 죽음관, 영혼관, 저승세계관 고찰","Humans are always afraid of death and want to know the truth. Beyond the times and peoples, humans have always tried to interpret death and tried to overcome death through the formation of human and worldviews. The Siberian people also have a culture related to their own death. Through the culture of death, they gave meaning to life in reality and established order among generations. In this paper, the author surveyed the data of the death, the soul and the underworld of the Aboriginal people and analyzed the existing reports of Russian reaserchers. Siberian natives believe that life was eternal in the beginning. However, death is caused by various causes, and death is the state in which a soul is kidnapped by a bad spirits. Human has several souls, and even if souls are kidnapped, they do not die completely. With the soul, if the breath of life is broken, it will die. A soul abducted by a bad spirits goes to the world of the dead in the lower western world, located in the north or west. This world is opposite to this world. The dead here live a new life. The author shows that death is not the end but a new life through the Siberian culture of death. Life and death are ontologically one, and the Godhead of heaven and earth made by the materials of this earth (earth) - It shows the completion of the world view of the Siberian Aborigines, the underground deity and another world (underground). Life and death are not opposites or different concepts, but humans can enjoy the value of being if they are together.",이건욱(Lee Gunwook),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106925150
고대 러시아(Древняя Русь)의 정체성 발현 양상:《보리스와 글레프 이야기》와 《율법과 은총에 관한 이야기》를 중심으로,"In this paper, close similarities of the structure and ideas of the narration of Boris and Gleb and a word of Law and Grace are considered. In connection with this, this article is devoted to the examination of the historicity and religiosity of Ancient Russia. We should understand the idea and structure of the narration of Boris and Gleb in the context of the broader narrative of the tales of Bygone Years. Nestor, the author of this tales, planned the unity of Ancient Russia through the obedience and brotherly love of Boris and Gleb. He conducts a complicated concept with a journalistic aspiration to convince the princes to end the disastrous wars for the Russian people. Thus, the idea of brotherly love of the princes and their subjugation to the elder was put forward by Nestor as the central link in the historical events of recent years. This narration ideologically and stylistically approaches a word of Law and Grace of Metropolitan Ilarion. Ilarion resorts to numerous parallels from the Bible and stubbornly emphasizes that new people are needed for a new faith, that is, Olga, Vladimir, Svyatoslav and others. He affirms the superiority of Christianity over Judaism and paganism, Grace over the Law. Ilarion, moving from general to particular, narrows that the Russian church and nation acquire the equivalence of the Byzantine church and even more specific features. As a result, Ilarion and Yaroslav the wise succeed in laying solid foundations for Russian political and ecclesiastical independence. Thus, two Narratives are dedicated to the common goal of glorifying the activities of the first Russians, and are linked by a single thought about the gradual triumph of Christianity in Russia.","이규영(Lee, Kywyoung)",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639138
