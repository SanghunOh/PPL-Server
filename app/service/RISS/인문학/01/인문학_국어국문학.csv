Additionally, it discusses how to respond to changes in the field and academic communities of writing education.
ChatGPT specializes in producing essays in response to user-generated questions. It also has the ability to transform and craft knowledge through writing. However, there is a risk of combining incorrect or false information owing to its deep learning algorithms. Learners in the AI era must possess the ability to create questions, meta-read intermediate text products, and source and verify information.
The significance of recursive writing features, basic literacy, copyright, and writing ethics is expected to remain high, along with previous theories. However, as we enter the AI era, changes are expected in the way writers and writing are described, the context of tasks used in instruction and assessment, and the relationship with transformative competencies.",장성민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108741628
ChatGPT 글쓰기 표절 대응과 교육적 활용 전략,"The promise of ChatGPT, a Large Language Model AI, has led to both excitement and concern about its educational applications. In particular, many educators fear that students will use AI to generate and submit written assignments, leading to the coining of the phrase “AIgiarism”. The goal is to build “AI-immunity,” which makes it harder for AI to take over assignments, while still ensuring educational effectiveness. However, it is difficult to distinguish AI use from AI plagiarism. Rather, a shift in education is required through active understanding and utilization of AI. To this end, the design direction of teaching and learning for the redesign of education was presented by overcoming the problem of writing plagiarism using ChatGPT. It is expected that it will be a basic study to minimize risks and maximize potential benefits in the educational use of ChatGPT in the future.",노대원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108600540

"과학과 마음, 수사드라마의 두 양태 -김은희 작가를 중심으로-","The rise of the mystery genre in the mainstream genre of pop culture in Korea can be largely attributed to television dramas. As previous studies have pointed out, reasoning has been very important in television dramas since the 2000s. Reason has been important as a means to fulfill the main character of a television drama, as well as the novelty of the dramatic form. As drama began to be produced in earnest after the 2000s, the demand for reason has grown beyond the previous period. It is necessary to consider the fact that the demand for the mystery genre has been activated by environmental changes outside the text, along with the overall expansion of television dramas since the 2000s.
In this regard, the appearance of Kim Eun-hee, who has established herself as an investigative drama writer, is important. She started with “Sign”, “The Ghost,” and “Signal,” and has secured the persuasion of investigative dramas through different filters of science and mind; this has continued with “The Elder.” It is significant that television's chosen breakthrough, with cable and end-to-end, is in a ""jangle."" Even in the case of Kim Eun-hee, various genres have been tried in the realm of television drama, and the essential presence of reasoning elements in entertainment and cultural programs is evidence that television will not be able to form a pathway of communication with viewers in the way it interprets them beforehand. Kim Eunhee's genre selection has resulted in the beginning of a change in television dramas and the creation of a new chapter where the realities of the 2010s and the fiction of television dramas are combined.
Beyond the topical aspects, Korean television dramas since the 2010s cannot help but address the reality of facing new challenges in many ways. The boundaries of television dramas have faded amid a visible decline in the influence of television, and the advent of a new era of new media featuring original content. In an era where television dramas can be viewed anytime, anywhere due to the influence of YouTube and Netflix, the existence of television dramas needs to be reconsidered.",송치혁,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635126
챗지피티(ChatGPT)의 등장과 국어교육의 대응,"The purpose of this study is to predict changes in the Korean language education ecosystem that are expected with the advent of chatGPT, a generative and interactive AI, and to explore how Korean language education should respond to these changes quickly. To this end, the overall development and development process, main features and functions of ChatGPT were examined. In addition, the change of Korean language education according to the advancement of ChatGPT's function was predicted, and the way Korean language education should go was explored in order to respond to it.
As a generative and conversational artificial intelligence, the main features and functions of ChatGPT are as follows. First of all, as generative artificial intelligence, it searches and learns numerous materials on the Internet based on large language models and generative pre-trained transformer to produce results. Next, as a conversational artificial intelligence, it is possible to communicate in the form of daily conversation, remembers the contents of previous conversations, and reflects them in subsequent conversations. It works like a chatbot, and when you ask a question in the form of a ‘sentence’, the result is output in various ways, such as text.
The following is a look at the impact that the advancement of the ChatGPT function will have on Korean language education and the countermeasures against it. First, the impact on Korean language education can be problems such as ① the challenge of writing education in general, ② the deepening of the ethical problem of writing, and ③ the spread of fake information. To respond to this, it is necessary to ① redefine the nature of writing education, ② (tentative name) strengthen writing ethics education by preparing ethical principles for writing using artificial intelligence, and ③ expand critical literacy education through critical reading instruction.
The emergence of ChatGPT and the development of technology that is advancing day by day may be felt as a significant challenge toward Korean language education. However, rather than paying attention to its side effects or shortcomings, it is necessary to pay attention to the advantages of positive and instrumental use. Therefore, the exploration of how to utilize it from the point of view of win-win and coexistence and instrumental point of view, rather than the confrontation between machines and humans, will be much more productive and progressive. I hope that research on the use of artificial intelligence to support human growth will continue.",강동훈,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108206347
탈진실(post-truth) 속 문학정전 교육의 가치 모색 -하이데거(M. Heidegger)의 존재론과 해석학-,"Postmodernism has powered “uncanonization” in literary education since the 1990s. However, the distortion of postmodernism in the 2020s has led to “post-truth.” Post-truth blurs the boundary between truths and lies, making distinctions thereof meaningless. In this confusing age, we must re-explore teaching canon. So the problems of canon and canon education are reviewed, which is dilemma between legitimacy and autonomy. To solve it Heidegger’s ontology and hermeneutics are investigated. Because literary language shows indecisiveness, literary works lead a reader to their truths, questioning our world that we have considered to be true. A new perception of the world is a new perception of oneself, thus Literary truths renew a reader with an own individual identity (or moods). It is difficult to assume that literary truth is in non-canon; hence, teaching canon helps form a learner's intrinsic whole life.
This study proposes the criteria for an educational canon following Heidegger’s philosophy; that is, it must be reproducible, not be written in contemporary times, and exhibit attitudes of value seeking. The principle of teaching canon is also suggested: A single canon must be taught as a vector of multiple truths in multiple contexts; but in a single context, finding a variant but single interpretation must be endlessly tried.",김동영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108759653

To this end, the achievement standards of the 2022 KLC media section were analyzed and compared with those of other sections of the same curriculum and of the 2015 KLC. In order to examine the significance of the media section, the meaning of the achievement standards was analyzed. Moreover, at the same time, there was also an identification of how, before and after the establishment of the media section, the aforementioned meaning differed and connected with the achievement standards of other sections within the KLC was identified. As a result, the achievement standards in the media section were divided into two groups according to criteria of connectivity and differentiation. The achievement standards with highly connectivity were subdivided into three types, and improvement directions were proposed for those with high levels of differentiation.",박종관,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635125

김초엽 소설에 나타난 포스트휴머니즘과 장애,"In an attempt to examine the ethics of posthumanism, this article explores the science fiction novels of Cho-yeop Kim, which demonstrate an expansive thinking on disability, while also considering the practical resistance and subversiveness of the posthuman subject.
Chapter 2 analyzes works that raise questions about the development of science and technology that advance transhumanist values. The application of science and technology to the elimination of disability through correction and treatment excludes the possibility of the disabled person’s specific and intentional life. Cho-yeop Kim’s science fiction writing emphasizes that raising the possibility of being able to choose one’s own life and preventing one from being deprived of the opportunity to prove one’s own dignity must become the direction and purpose of scientific and technological development that respects the lives of people with disabilities.
Chapter 3 examines the real-world praxis of people with disabilities, which includes deconstructing the normative concept of “human” as a form of resistance to non-disability- centrism and revealing the contradictions that derive from the perspective that takes the abilities of non-disabled people as a standard norm. Cho-yeop Kim’s novels represent the hybridity of the post-human subject by deconstructing the taken-for-grantedness of the body and transforming it into a technologically mediated body. In addition, by actively appropriating the term “discomfort,” which is a term of contempt and disgust, the physical function, which was branded as “disabled,” expands the realm of limited human senses and can be recognized for its efficiency and functionality as a new communication method.
As mentioned above, Cho-yeop Kim’s works produce ethical meanings by reconceptualizing disability in the post-human era and rearticulating the relationship between high technology and people with disabilities. In Cho-yeop Kim’s novels, disability is not represented as something that will disappear through the development of science and technology. Moreover, the meaning of disability can be found in the fact that it reveals that if there has been no transformation in thinking about people with disabilities and disability as a product of cognitive stigma, then there is clearly no such thing as perfect technology or the perfect human.",김윤정,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100825730
아동기 문해력 발달 격차에 대한 문제해결적 접근,"This study diagnoses childhood literacy development gap in Korea and probes problem-solving solutions to it in the school system. The concept of childhood literacy has appeared in the trend of approach to literacy development in the viewpoint of sociocultural development of human. Childhood literacy encompasses early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescent literacy, covering from the birth to the 12th grade in Korean education system.

<더 글로리>에 나타난 가해자의 권력과 폭력 연구,"<The Glory> is a work that shows the seriousness of school violence that still occurs and repeats in the Korean education field, showing the problem of school violence and the bare faces of the assailants who lead it. Especially, focusing on the main character who suffered physical and mental pain due to school violence in adolescence, the issue of power and violence is brought to the fore by dealing with the process of a group of assailants collapsing on their own due to the occurrence of a small gap. Hereat, this paper identifies the changes in the power structure and the aspects of violence over time, focusing on the members of the assailant group, who are the main drivers of school violence, and further examines the weakening of power through the destruction of relationships and the process of group dissolution.
Chapter 2 examines the power structure and aspects of violence among assailant groups in adolescence. The power structure of the assailant group is formed by the wealth and social influence of the family in the case of adolescence. Those in power in the group of assailants maintain their power by means of freedom and violence, but unlike freedom, violence cannot lead to voluntary obedience. However, the way of freedom also hides objective violence behind it and is only an imperfect and weak power in that it can be easily broken at any time the moment it emerges from the surface.
Chapter 3 looks at the process of weakening the existing power and the subsequent dissolution of the group when the relationship between the assailant group members is cracked and destroyed after they become adults. The visualization of objective violence hidden in adolescence destroys existing relationships by revealing the problem of unilateral violence according to rank even among members of the same assailant group. The assailant group's power is weakened and further dismantled by using each other's weaknesses to overthrow the power structure that has been believed to be solid, or by using greater violence to prevent it in the process. As a consequence, the end of the assailant group members due to the weakening of power through the destruction of relationships and the dissolution of the group is punished in such a way that the assailant group members return to their adolescence Likewise, the significance of <The Glory> can be found in that it can understand the relationship between power and violence by showing the conflicting structure of the victims and assailants of school violence during adolescence and adulthood. Also, it is expected that more diverse stories will be drawn in that it is possible to analyze not only the assailant group but also the relationship with the victims of school violence through follow-up research.",조규찬,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101913217

The results revealed that, in terms of reading performance, reading attitudesbecome lower as the grade rises, especially among non-reader groups. Second,while reader groups had high internal motivation for reading, non-reader groupshad a large amount of external motivation, such as “forced by parents orteachers.” On the other hand, for non-reader groups “smartphones are moreinteresting.” In addition, as a cause of moving away from reading, readers’ groupshad a lot of “learning increases,” while non-reader groups had “buying & usingsmartphones” as factors. Overall, the reader is reluctant to read due to “testsand tasks,” and non-reader groups especially had difficulty understanding text.
Third, smartphone usage and reading attitude have an inverse relationship.

The case that combined foreign and korean language and wrote korean language all kinds of words would be happen meaning change. But the expression of english writing either word or sentence could not happen meaning change because customer could do a translation into korean. 3. The using foreign language is for a superiority through differentiate strategy. So the customer that use foreign language has a thought of superiority, and they think they are not the same as other customer. These differentiation could give expression to use foreign language. This is a strategy that makes for customer's superiority. 4. The using foreign language is for new expression and group consciousness. Every utterance are search for new, and fresh expression always. In advertisement foreign language is used for new expression often. Using foreign language means high quality imagnation and differentiation socially, and due to these actual condition advertisement uses to foreign language. 5.

문학사교육의 내용과 방향에 대한 재검토 - 고등학교 『국어』와 『문학』의 현대소설사 교육을 중심으로 -,"In order to examine the current status of literature history education and seek a better direction for literature history education, this paper critically examined the aspects of modern novel history education, focusing on the literature history unit of high school “Korean” and “Literature” textbooks according to the 2015 revised curriculum.
In the case of high school “Korean” textbooks, many textbooks focused on proving the continuity and uniqueness of Korean literary history. And it was problematic because it explicitly dealt with ‘humor and satire’ as a unique characteristic of Korean narrative literature. In addition, all of the modern novels included as ‘representative works by era’ in the literature history unit of high school “Korean” textbooks were mainly set in the 1970s and 1980s. Through these, the literary history topics that literary history unit want to deal with can be summarized as industrialization, dictatorship, and division. This proves that the subject of literature history education as an inquiry activity is inevitably very limited.
In the case of high school “Literature” textbooks, the starting point of ‘modern’ was generally defined as the flowering period and the era was classified into ‘1900s~liberation/after liberation~until the 2000s.’ In the case of modern novels included as text sanctions in these literary history units, it can be seen that no new blackout was discovered in the literary historical composition from the enlightenment period to the 1970s. However, as literary history in the 1990s and 2000s was recognized as the content of literary history education, new works that can also be accessed by learners’ now-here began to be included in literary history units. This can be regarded as a positive change in that it can promote diversification and presentation of topics when conducting activities to reconstruct relationships to form a literary historical perspective.",고지혜,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100178333
"시제, 상, 양태","Korean is a tensed language with the tertiary distinction past-present-future. A proper tense maker is used obligatorily or typically in locating the event denoted by the clause on the temporal axis. ‘-eo iss-’ and ‘-go iss1-’ are resultative aspect markers, and ‘-go iss2-’ is a continuous aspect marker. Middle Korean had a perfective-imperfective aspectual distinction in past tense, and this system persists in adnominal forms of verbs up until now. Modal elements in Korean show a relatively low degree of grammaticalization, so that Korean has barely any grammatical category of mood, except in adnominal and nominal forms of verbs. In the languages of the world, including Korean, we can attest many cases in which a grammatical element has multiple semantic components belonging to more than one category among tense, aspect, modality, evidentiality and mirativity.",박진호,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100178356
홍길동의 인물형상으로 본 <홍길동전>의 의미,"A dream about a dragon and an offspring of a concubine corresponds to the condition for existence of the Honggildong. This condition for existence plays an important role in the life of the Honggildong. The Honggildong, therefore, has the character shape of an unfortunate, complaining man because this two conditions for existence conflict with each other in it's special quality.
Because that impact putted pressure with the condition for existence of an offspring of a concubine was very intensive, the Honggildong could not acquire the significance of existence of his life without settlement of this problem. So was the full course of his struggle tightly linked with settlement of this problem. And through his struggle with the ruler of the nation, the Honggildong' image as an active person, as the master of his destiny was highlighted.
The Honggildong could realize the condition for existence of a dream about a dragon and overcome the condition for existence of an offspring of a concubine through his acquirement of the minister of byungjo(병조). But the minister of byungjo was no more than a virtual image. That the Honggildong exploited overland Yuldoguk(율도국) was the result of recognition on this problem and writhe for freedom from diverse pressures of Joseon(조선) dynasty.
The honggildong could be free from diverse pressures - for example brotherly love, filial piety, loyalty etc. - of Joseon dynasty though exploitation of overland Yuldoguk. So could he rise to a king of the Yuldoguk at last, and realize the condition for existence of a dream about a dragon and overcome the condition for existence of an offspring of a concubine completely. In this point of view, we can say that the <Honggildongjeon(홍길동전)>emphasizes the necessity of the society which is treated the man of special ability respectfully, the necessity of the nation which is ruled by a man of special ability.",이문규,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108585367
2022년 개정 교육과정 국어과 ‘내용 체계’의 변화와 현대소설 교육의 과제 - 환경·생태 위기와 다문화·소수자 문제를 중심으로,"As the 2022 revised curriculum is finalized, many changes are expected in secondary school literature(novel) education in the future. Environmental/ecological crises and social conflicts, which are pointed out as the background of curriculum revision in the general discussion, deserve attention in that they are particularly related to the field of literature. Therefore, in this paper, we discussed how the environmental/ecological crisis and social inequality/minority issues, which were pointed out as the immediate challenges of our community in the new curriculum, can be meaningfully learned through literature(novel) education.
In the existing novel education, environmental and ecological problems were mainly focused on introspecting the destruction of nature by humans on the premise of the dichotomy of human and nature separation. However, novel education that learns ecological sensibility as a matter of course not only abstracts the complexity of the social dimension inherent in the climate/environmental crisis, but is also less effective as novel education itself. As examined in Chapter 2, it is because the novel method of existing textbooks that emphasizes the necessity of ecological education not only ignores the complexity and urgency of the environmental and ecological crisis, but also has a high possibility of causing misreading of the work. Social inequality and minority problem education using novels also have similar problems. As examined in Chapter 3, if the educational use method of novel text is not considered, there is a possibility that novels dealing with minority issues will rather be learned as a medium to identify minorities or promote social inequality.
Most of the dilemmas that arise when learning about environmental /ecological crises and social inequality/minority issues using novels stem from the stylistic characteristics of novels that rely on causal narratives. Since novels represent problems in reality as causal narratives, there is always a possibility that they are not distinguished from the representation system of reality or that they are appropriated by the dominant ideology. Therefore, in order to learn community issues meaningfully using novels, it is necessary to pay attention not only to causal narratives but also to the mediating action of novels. The realistic problems of our community still exist as limitations in Korean novels that reflect them, but literature has the self-aware capacity to see through the limitations built into its style itself. Literature uses the referential function of language, but it is defined as literature because it can determine the use and legitimacy of language as a tool to represent reality. Therefore, the task of mastering the unique capabilities of this literary language should be a key way to prevent individual isolation and foster a sense of community among learners.",김명훈,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108042521
중국어 속담에서 개의 상징 의미와 의미 자질 분석,"The dog, one of the animals frequently appearing in Chinese proverbs, is humanity’s first domesticated animal. It is friendly toward people and extremely loyal to its owner. The symbolic meaning of animals may differ depending on language and culture. Even if the vocabulary structure of the same language is used, the emotive meaning may differ depending on the lexical category. For example, when referring to people or things, “狗(dog)” as a Chinese word mainly portray a negative image, but “狗(dog)” and “犬(dog)” in Chinese proverbs contain both positive and negative connotations.
In Chinese proverbs, positive semantic features of “狗/犬(dog)” include [+good], [+loyal], [+faithful], [+profit], [+luck], and [+wealth]. Its negative semantic features are [-high status], [-high dignity], [+cunning], [+vile], [-good], [+dirty], [+vulgar], [-spiritual], [-courageous], [+dull], and [-competent]. Among these, [+good] and [-good]’s semantic features can all be observed, which have different semantic features according to a dog’s characteristics. For example, a dog, considered a loyal animal to humans, is [+good]. However, its dirty and lowly behaviors, uncorrectable by nature, are compared to the behavior of an evil person, leading to a [-good] semantic feature.
Additionally, “狗/犬 (dog)” in Chinese proverbs is considered an animal that brings good luck and wealth. This is influenced by the old Chinese superstition and contains cultural-specific [+luck] and [+wealth] semantic features.",이명아,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108730967
