
조기 영어교육의 실태와 바람직한 방향,"This paper aims to find out the current state of early English education in the world(including Korea) and to suggest its more desirable direction, with special reference to TEFL in elementary school of Korea.
In fact English teaching in elementary schools of Korea has been put into practice as an extracurricular activity since 1982. But in 1995 the Ministry of Education proclaimed a policy to establish a TEFL program as the regular course in elementary schools of Korea since 1997.
In this connection, the writer surveyed several kinds of theories about early English education to verify the necessity and validity of Korea's elementary school English education. The logical result from these theories is that younger children are better equipped to learn foreign languages with efficiency than older children or adults. However, as most studies are based on logical inferences rather than on direct observation or experimental evidence, we are not sure that those theories are right.
In this view, the writer put stress on the preparation of educational environments to establish a more desirable direction of early English education in Korea, since Korea's elementary school English education will be practiced under EFL environment, not ESL environment. The writer also pointed out some problems of educational finances, the curriculum development process and its content, teaching materials(textbooks and tapes), English teachers, teaching methods evaluation, educational facilities.
This paper concludes that we have to try to solve these problems to succeed in a TEFL program in elementary schools of Korea and suggests several things for a more desirable direction of Korea's elementary school English education.",김해겸,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19562480
영어 관계대명사 That 연구,"Relative pronoun that is one of the important relative pronouns but we have an impression that its scope of use has been somewhat narrowed. In the light of history of relative pronouns relative pronoun that has the longest history of all relative pronouns and it was widely used even in Middle English and early Modern English. on the other hand, we can see that the relative use of that has been gradually weakened as the relative pronouns who and which has expanded their scope of use.
It is quite natural that the scope of use of that as a relative pronoun has been narrowed as who is mainly used in referring to person and which is mainly used in referring to things. And we can note that that is used only in restrictive clauses, not in nonrestrictive clauses, for that has a strong characteristics of relative conjunetion in comparing with who and which.
That as a relative pronoun still has its own weight because it can take an antecedent referring to person and thing. In particular, it is general tendency that who is used more frequently than that in the case of referring to person because that originally comes from neuter and gives a psychological feeling that it is not adequate for that to refer to things. In contrast, who has an advantage over that because the former originally refers only to person.",최종욱,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19617265
트라우마의 재현과 시청,"Psychological theories of trauma have explained how the experience of physical harm or life-threatening situations can cause long-term behavioral and memory disorders. These theories explain the destructive effect of trauma on victims and allow greater empathy for them. Today, visual media such as film, television, and the Internet regularly contain vivid depictions of violence and catastrophe. Although the impact of these representations has been an going focus of trauma research, people appear to have learn how to watch representations of extreme violence without suffering obvious psychological effects. However, this conclusion may be premature in that recent trauma theories, developed by authors such as Shoshana Felman and Cathy Caruth, tend to concern to excessive exact and authentic transmission of trauma. This research trend does not explore multiple and extended means of experiencing trauma or suggest an acceptable mode of transmission for media saturated with traumatic images and representations. The aim of this article is to critique current trauma theory and to explore other ways to portray traumatic experiences in modem media. As an alternative strategy, the discussion draws on Joshua Hirsch's notion of ""post-traumatic cinema"" and suggests possible direction for transmitting and perceiving traumatic experiences through an analysis of the film, Grbavica: Land of My Dream, which presents an example of the strategy.",서길완,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76554089

사랑과 죽음의 이중성 : 『로미오와 줄리엣』과 모순어법,"Shakespeare deals with the multiple and hidden aspects of love and death in his early tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. In this play love is a madness, a malady, a quest, and a cult, while timeless death is, in its nocturnal metaphor, transformed into the eternal stellarization of mortal and sensual love. Shakespeare depicts from the very beginning of the play that mingling of contradictory elements of love and hate, peace and violence, day and night, and body and spirit. These mutually exclusive elements are not, as they might appear, absolutely and essentially compartmentalized, but they suffer metamorphoses to the contrary in the operations of time and seasonal cycles of nature. Metaphor is the linguistic device par excellence to express this metamorphic character of things and ever shifting meanings of words.
Oxymoron is the rhetorical device Shakespeare uses in this play predominantly of all others in order to dramatize the dialectical and dynamic nature of love and death. Oxymoron, or double-crossing, draws together of contrary elements to produce an unexpected sense of balance and some shocking recognition of seeming hidden truths of things. It is a kind of very witty and conceited play of words. However, here it is more than a witty word game. Rather it is a thematic device expressing the conflict and conflation of love and violent death. Oxymoron is also at the bottom of the structural development of the play, crossing comedy into tragedy, and tragedy into comedy in turn.
Romeo and Juliet achieve their consummation of love in death, not in copulation. To Romeo death is his rival lover, not the destroyer of love. As is seen in Juliet's sexually candid apostrophe to Night, the typical image of Death, Death is eagerly wished for as a lover. In this play of names, the definition of a word is turned into its opposite, as poison is called a medicine, a cordial, and a restorative. In this double crossing of two or more contradictory dimensions, one is cancelled out by the other, and a third new con-fusion is brought forth. If Romeo and Juliet's love is possible from the fatal loins of the family feud, their death is the jointure drawing together of two enemy hands into love. Oxymoron is the golden monuments, made of the jointure of Romeo and Juliet. Tomb and womb are more than rhyme's sake in this play of turnings and tropes. Oxymoron is the rhtorical device as well as the thematic and structural one of the play. It is assumed to be the main character in this tragedy.",박우수(Park WooSoo),2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106433329
『올리버 트위스트』에 나타난 빈민 통제 전략,"The decade of the 1830s in England was characterized by prolonged violent industrial unrests and the political noise. This atmosphere of simmering unrest in all parts of the country awakened the worry on social revolution to the authorities. A lot of measures including New Poor Law which ruling class took resulted from the perception that the poor were potential criminals and the concern about social revolution. To prevent such wrong turning the ruling class used the strategy that the poor were poor, not because of social injustice, but because of their own sins of profligacy, recklessness, and immorality. Utilitarianism and Evangelicalism were the key means to execute this strategy. The reforms and education based on Evangelicalism and Utilitarianism set a goal of maintaining existing social order and training the labourers who were suitable for industrial society. In Oliver Twist, Dickens expressed strong objection to the strategy for controlling the poor by the authorities because he believed that the poverty not resulted from personal character flaw but the uneven social structure. Charles Dickens was critical of the whole structure of beliefs concerning the poor which underlay the legal system of his time.","김외현(Kim, Wey-Hyun)",2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99695341

십자군 전쟁을 바라보는 작가의 시각 연구,"In the traditional Christian World, the Crusades have been considered as 'religious wars' which liberated Jerusalem from the hands of 'infidels', namely Muslims. But Muslims think differently about the Crusades. They consider the period of the Crusades as 'that of Frankish invasion to plunder Islamice lands and treasures'. In Warriors of God James Reston tries to include these different points of view. He tries to see and describe the Crusades from both the Christian and the Islamic points of view equally.
But can the writer of Warriors of God describe the Crusades without prejudice? Because he was born, has been brought up and taught in the Christian world, and he is also a Christian, it seems to be very hard for him to overcome the barriers of Christian point of view. In this thesis the answers to this question will be found in two respects: the first, by explaining the writer's comments on the Crusades' motivations, and the second, by analyzing the writer's points of view about two heroes of the Third Crusade, Richard, the Lionheart and Saladin.",이현주,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82415071
『재즈』에 나타난 도시의 의미와 흑인 역사,"The crucial concern of Toni Morrison has been the reconstruction of Afro-American history which has been disremembered and unaccounted for. In particular, Toni Morrison is concerned with Afro-American's migration to the city after Emancipation and the meaning of Harlem in Jazz. The purpose of this paper is to study the meaning of City in the Afro-American history and to examine the experiments with narrative form and language in Toni Morrison's Jazz.
Harlem and the city in general has a different significance for Afro-Americans and Morrison tries to recover the meaning of Harlem in Jazz. The city has a legendary significance to the Afro-Americans as they expect they can enjoy new-found freedoms and excitements there. However, the violence begins with the move to the city and it has its roots in the murky past. Morrison focuses not on one era or another, but on the connections between the two. By retracing the past lives of Joe, Violet and their families from the North to the South, from the city to the country, and from the twentieth to the nineteenth-century, she shows the motive and the force that drive the violence of Joe and Violet in Harlem 1920s. The meaning of Harlem is explored through Morrison's experiment with narrative form and language. Some of the instability within the narrative is effected from the use of techniques of jazz music and the unreliable narrator. In particular the unreliability of the narrator is destabilising element in the narrative, which shows the instability of the Afro-American experiences in the city.
Morrison dramatizes the redemption of Violet and Joe-a vision of self discovery within racial tradition in the final section. In addition, in the narrator's attempting an improvisory piece on the quality of mature love, Morrison emphasizes ""touch"", which confirms the mystery of human love in black community. She rebels against the assimilation and inevitable reification of Afro-Americans in the city and esteems the continuity of the black communities, which exist behind and which transcend the boundaries drawn up by the whites.",장정희,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102044286

While not yet perfect, compared to the writing of a typical foreign language learner, machine translation exhibits few grammatical errors, even considering the context of the entire paragraph. This study is an attempt to analyze the effect of machine translation on English writing instruction. In the English writing class for this study, students were instructed to take advantage of machine translation to engage in free writing activities. And ‘writing efficacy questionnaire’ and ‘free English writing’ were conducted at the beginning of the semester and at the end of the semester. The English writing instruction using machine translation were analyzed to have paid off to great results: despite the students’ limited English proficiency, the writing efficacy of all the students showed a significant increase. In general, the upper class students showed greater increase, and the lower students’ increase were relatively limited. However, regardless of the differences in the students’ English proficiency, the amount of English composition by every student has increased.

포스트휴먼의 위가,"As Cartesian ego or consciousness is annihilated under the influence of Poststructuralism, humanism is coming to an end, along with its transformation into posthumanism. In the background against which liberal humanism emphasizing the autonomous subject is on the decline and posthumanism fills its blank, there is the great progress in cybernetics, information theory, microbiology, virtual reality, and cognitive science. Since Nobert Wiener proposed it is theoretically possible to telegraph a human being as early as 1950s and much discourse on molecular biology regards information as the essential code the body expresses, the human may be reduced to a pattern of information. As a result, a new human form makes an appearance. It is the posthuman in which there are no essential differences between bodily existence and computer simulation, biological organism and cybernetic mechanism.
The essay (1) examines the process in which the human transforms itself into the posthuman with the mechanical thought penetrating into the theory of the relation between mind and body, and (2) analyzes the types of the posthuman in such literary texts as Greg Bear's Blood Music, Cole Perriman's Terminal Games, Richard Powers' Galatea 2.2, and Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, Particularly based on the theory of Katherine Hayles, who explains the posthuman on the level of materiality, mutation, hyperreality, and information. Through this analysis, the essay concludes that the status of the posthuman should be established in ways that enhance our life.",김상구,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19708316

거울과 창문 - 벨라스케스의 『궁정의 시녀들』에 대한 푸코와 라캉의 주체와 재현 이론,"An indisputable masterpiece of Western art, Vel？zquez""s Las Meninas has triggered a plethora of critical interpretations and debates on its meaning and artistic appeal. The critical debate mainly concerns the question of the subject and representation. Art historians acclaimed the painting as an accurate and even photographic representation of reality while explaining its meaning as an expression of the artist’s aspirations for personal nobility and his desire to ennoble the social status of painting from a manual craft to one of the liberal arts. They make a seemingly contradictory claim that the painting is at once a realistic representation of the outer world and a manifestation of the painter’s inner desire, paying little attention to the relationship between the two.
Michel Foucault’s provocative analysis of the painting in The Order of Things has the virtue of teasing out and elaborating upon the question of the subject and representation on a theoretical level. Foucault, however, privileges representation over the subject. He singles out Las Meninas as a pictorial exemplification of the Classical episteme that elided the subject and its representing act in the world of representation. Las Meninas only represents the three functions of representation―the painter, the model, and the spectator―in the dispersed figures in the painting, without representing the subject who remains invisible outside the picture plane. Las Meninas is a representation of representation, and its central focus is the mirror because it is a medium of pure representation without the subject, making visible what is invisible.
Jacques Lacan argues against Foucault that a picture involves the subject out of the structural necessity of the scopic drive. Drawing upon projective geometry that posits a vanishing point and a distance point, Lacan translates these two points respectively into the eye as the viewing subject and the gaze as the object a, the lost object of the subject. A picture contains these two points, doubly inscribing the split subject. In Las Meninas, the gaze or the gazing subject appears in Vel？zquez the painter while the eye appears in Nieto Vel？zquez, the painter’s namesake and duplication. The gaze or object a also appears in the interval between the painter and the canvas, and in the princess Margarita, whose skirt hides that sign of castration which betokens the primary loss of the subject. Las Meninas does not display a mirror of representation, but stages a window of fantasy in which the subject of the drive makes a circular movement around the object a. It is a Vorstellungsrepr？sentanz, a representative of representation that represents the lost-and thus unrepresentable-subject of the real.",양석원(Seokwon Yang),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19560584
결혼선택을 통한 여성의 주체성과 도덕성 함양 : 『오만과 편견』을 중심으로,"In 19th century British society, men and women were divided into private and public spheres; and men’s role was to progressively pioneer life in the public sphere, while women’s role was to passively comfort men in the private sphere. This role division meant that women had relative, not independent existences. This era also had a severe economic gap between the rich and the poor; the labor or lower class was destitute, with women living even harder lives than labor workers. Repression and unfair treatment toward women was an important issue during this period. Working class women were dually oppressed, both economically and sexually. Jane Austen satirizes the reality of British society with positive female consciousness that transcends the contemporary gender ideology.

『로미오와 줄리엣』 : 희극과 비극의 대비와 조화,"Romeo and Juliet differs from the other Shakespearean tragedies in that it emphasizes both good fortune (or the pleasures of life) and misfortune (or the pains of life) equally. This play celebrates Romeo and Juliet's joyful love as much as it laments their tragic death. It is a play with mixed comic and tragic elements, which proceeds happily like Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its first half but turns out tragically in its second half. Also, the first comic half carries ominous forebodings of catastrophe while the second tragic half is mingled with comic scenes, so that both comic and tragic elements can appear alternately (or simultaneously) throughout the play. This paper explains in detail such tragicomic structure, examining its effects on the play's themes, plots, characters, atmospheres, and overall dramatic effects and also discussing how the unique structure illuminates the meaning of the playas a whole.
The tragicomic structure of this play achieves a variety of effects. First of all, it gives the audience a very colorful and exciting experience of not only appreciating both tragedy and comedy within a play, but also watching the continuous reversals of events and atmospheres between comedy and tragedy. Second, as the play changes in genre from comedy to tragedy, its main characters grow mature and strong and the roles of its secondary characters become serious and complex, which adds zest and artistic merit to the play. Also the tragic reversal in the play, occurring after the whole process and outcome of the previous comic action, evokes a greater sense of woe than in other tragedies. Conversely, as the tragic sense grows deeper, so the comic vision underneath the tragic consequence-that is, the reconciliation between the two antagonistic families and the prospects of peaceful order in Verona-becomes more valuable and nobler. The coexistence and intersection of the comic and the tragic in the play thus produce the synergy effect of enhancing each other by contrast.
The tragicomic structure of the play reflects both the bright and dark sides of life. It also shows the ironic fact of life that happiness causes deeper sorrow which in turn helps to bring greater pleasure. Man, like the whole action of the play, is born to experience the ups and downs of fortune and doomed to die in the end. This play suggests that the best way for man to cope with the tragic destiny should be to lead his life with courage and dignity and sublimate his inevitable death into a noble and valuable act (or sacrifice) like Romeo and Juliet, whose deaths bring reconciliation and peace to Verona. The sense of spiritual triumph arising from this brings an affirmative view that life is worth living despite the hostility of its fate, which is a comic vision of life in a broad sense. In this respect, the tragicomic structure of this play points to the dialectic harmony in which comedy is reversed into tragedy that in turn brings forth comedy.",신웅재(Woong-Jae Shin),2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3166404
죽음과 성장: 『미들마치』와 『미 비포 유』,"This article adopts the perspective of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, who proclaimed that the only purpose of life is growth, in analyzing the deaths and legacies of Edward Casaubon and Peter Featherstone in George Eliot’s Middlemarch (1871-72) and Will Traynor in Jojo Moyes’s Me Before You (2012). There are two deaths and subsequent legacies at the center of Middlemarch. The patriarchal Casaubon belittles his wife as an excuse for his egoism and incompetent scholarship during his life, and endeavors to control her freedom after his death through his conditions of inheritance. meanwhile, Featherstone directs most of his estate to his illegitimate child, Joshua Rigg, though he was expected to leave his relatives a considerable legacy. Thus the deaths in both cases frustrate the growth of their survivors. An imminent death is also at the center of Me Before You, in which Will, a wealthy general paralysis patient, falls in love with his poor care-giver, Louisa. While she tries to reverse his decision to be euthanized, he encourages Louisa to widen her horizons. After being euthanized in Switzerland, Will continues to support Louisa through his legacy, which covers college tuition and living expenses.

트라우마와 정신분석,"In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud defines the trauma as the stimuli and excitations from outside that are powerful enough to break through the protective shield. In Lacanian terms, it can be translated into a breach of the symbolic system of representation, resulting in the production of the traumatic real. Generally speaking, the Lacanian real is an effect of symbolization that can not nevertheless be reducible to the symbolic order. Accordingly, the traumatic real can be looked upon as an effect of a negative/traumatic symbolization, which has to do with the breach of the symbolic system of representation. The traumatic event constitutes a liminal case in which the victim is situated in what Freud terms ‘anti-thetical representation,’
exposed to the ‘unrepresented’ ‘unsymbolized’ ‘unintegrated’ ‘unprocessed’ ‘unassimilated’'unclaimed’
experience, as the theoreticians of trauma name variously. It is worth noting that the traumatic real ungendered in the wake of the traumatic event is closely related to the activation of what Freud calls Todestrieb(death drive). This accounts for the way in which the victims of trauma are disintegrated sexually and/or aggressively, exposed to some derailments and transgressions. According to Triebmischung, the two classes of drive may be fused into sadism and/or masochism. Lacanian psychoanalysis can be defined as a way of working on the traumatic real by means of the symbolic, or a way of speaking the unspeakable through the medium of the signifier. Otherwise put, the analytic cure is an attempt to have an impact on affect by means of representation, thus changing the subject of jouissance via the subject of the signifier. It is only the signifier itself, the very tool of disintegration that can heal the wound it incises into the traumatic real, much like the way in which “only the spear that smote you, can heal your wound” as in Wagner’s Parsifal.",박찬부(Park Chan-Bu),2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76486989

소포클레스의 『안티고네』와 생명정치: 주디스 버틀러의 우울한 퀴어 주체와 애도가치,"The goal of this essay is to explore Sophocles’ Antigone in terms of “grievability” and “biopolitics” dealt with in Judith Butler’s The Force of Nonviolence: An Ethico-Political Bind. Butler interprets Antigone in the view of “queer subject” and “gender identity” in her work, Antigone’s Claim: Kinship Between Life and Death. Therefore, this essay reread Antigone from the perspective of “grievability” and “biopolitics” by asking “whose life counts as a life.”(Butler, The Force of Nonviolence 68) Although the work of reading Butler’s writing from Butlerian perspectives is the recursive interpretation, the work can deal with power and public violence of the government which makes a life valuable or not, or grievable or not, which Butler has already dealt with in Antigone’s Claim. Creon’s decree of the prohibition against mourning results into the hidden violence over bodies of vulnerable population and death in Antigone. Therefore, Antigone’s public mourning for her brother recovers those whose lives are considered ungrievable under law and restores the meaning and value to those who live precarious lives. In this context, Antigone’s Claim reveals that all lives are vulnerable and precarious, namely in threat of being killed, however, at the same time, they have power to preserve the life of the other. In her recent works, in particular in The Force of Nonviolence, Butler has posed the questions about vulnerability and interdependency, and the reason why we should cohabitate vulnerable others. In this context, this essay invites us to interpret Antigone as a work which delineates the way to resist the violence and biopolitics by revealing the meaning of preserving the life of the other and grieving openly, publicly someone’s death.",이지현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101929630
제피렐리와 루어만의 『로미오와 줄리엣』 영화 비교,"This study compares Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet and Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet to examine how each movie deals with the play's main themes of love, generation gap, social environment. and fate.
Zeffirelli's movie convincingly and movingly portrays the joy and beauty of the teenagers' passionate love, which is described here as charmingly fresh and pure, with touching details and rich eroticism. This movie also emphasizes the romantic purity and moral superiority of the young generation over the worldly-minded older generation. Furthermore, this movie reveals an optimistic view that the young protagonists' love and their sacrificial deaths will bring peace and order to Verona. And the circle images that often appear in the movie suggest that youthful love, despite its transitoriness, will be reborn generation after generation.
On the other hand, Luhrmann's movie focuses on the corrupt social environment as well as the tyranny of Fate, both of which constantly threaten to destroy the protagonists' love. This movie portrays an extremely pessimistic view that romantic love is merely an old-fashioned ideal and therefore no longer possible in the depraved contemporary world. The older generation in this movie is much more perverted and intimidating than in Zeffirelli's movie; indeed, they represent the chaotic modem society in which all kinds of iniquities and crimes are prevalent. Not only the older generation but also blind (or malignant) Fate ruthlessly frustrates the protagonists' love and finally destroys them. In their attempts to escape from such threats and dangers, the two lovers often find their temporary refuges in various types of water-an aquarium, a swimming pool, a sea of candles and blue neon signs, etc. But this water motif also indicates the movie's pessimism, for the watery world only provides a temporary relief and ultimately leads the protagonists to death.
Thus Zeffirelli's movie, which focuses on praising youthful love, is closer to a romantic tragedy, whereas Luhrmann's movie, which stresses the ills of the corrupt society and the cruelty of Fate, tends to be a social problem drama or a tragedy of fate. To compare both merits and demerits of the two movies, Zeffirelli's movie vividly and movingly reconstructs Shakespeare's timeless love story, but it fails to raise any deeper issues of contemporary society or of human destiny. On the other hand, Luhrmann's movie provides a sharp insight on the problems of the modern world or the tragic destiny of mankind, yet this insight causes the glory of love, the major theme of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, to be thrust aside. Zeffirelli's movie is faithful to Shakespeare's play, whereas Luhrmann's movie departs from both the setting and the message of the text in order to experiment with it for the director's own purpose. Both approaches are considered equally worthwhile because each attempt can increase the value of the Shakespearean text by enhancing its universality and modem relevance.",신웅재(Woong-Jae Shin),2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106048699
『로미오와 줄리엣』: 기쁨의 속성과 그 인과관계,"Romeo and Juliet is a play about the romantic death of 'a pair of star-cross'd lovers'. As Charles William argues that Shakespeare enjoys very luxurious grief in this play, we can find here, a pair of lovers overcome by their joyful exuberance falling into care and grief. These negative feeling leads them to death in the end.
They struggle to be together and lament the loss of the other's presence. When we get frustrated at the failure of getting the stuff we eagerly desire, we come to realize the sense of fate. In the play, the more Romeo and Juliet try to help the things that they cannot help, the more they come to confusion, because they would not see in themselves the habit of causing 'love-devouring death' the very moment of joy called love. The more they feel joy and delight to each other, the more strongly they feel the sense of fate.
This essay tries to show that our future opens depending on how we react to the situation the moment we meet with it. Romeo and Juliet's despair reminds us of the death-oriented omen consistently haunted in their love and their rhetoric rich with the imagination of death. Their death is caused by their habit of action when they seek the agony felt by imagining the absence of the other even without knowing. The didactic phrase, ""the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness' by Friar Lawrence tells the nature of the human that cannot but fall when they are not able to taste delight and joy fully. And the love story of Romeo and Juliet best illustrates the rule of such nature.",김미예(Miye Kim),2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82414978
야구와 전쟁을 통한 1940-50년대 미국 역사와 문화 교육,"Whitman and Twain celebrated baseball as the quintessential symbol of America, and Jacques Barzun stated that you need to learn baseball to understand ""the heart and mind of America."" As one of the most representative American sports, baseball has long been canonized as an American pastime, and Americans' infatuation with the game can be easily found in American popular culture and literary texts. In the course of American Literature and Culture, I have chosen three baseball-related texts as a lens to view and interrogate American culture and history in the period spanning the Second World War and the Korean War. While the objective is to initiate the first-year students into college level reading and analysis, and the course material highlights the intersection of American culture and literature with the significant implications of baseball in America. A League of Their Own (1992) chronicles the era of the Second World War, when the women's baseball league was established to fill the absence of major league baseball players. American Pastime (2007) portrays the same era but the focuses on the Japanese American internment camp where baseball functioned as an apparatus to maintain a sense of normalcy. Finally, Keeping Score (2008) intertwines plots of female bildungsroman with the love of baseball and the war in Korea. This article will demonstrate the ways in which all these texts allow students to engage the important questions of gender, race, identity, history, and America through baseball in spite of varying perspectives and strategies.",오승아,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105868513
올더스 헉슬리의 현대문명 비판에 대해,"Aldous Huxley's conception that literature, art and science are one was influenced by his grandfather, T. H. Huxley's Darwinian view of nature and his mother's uncle, Matthew Arnold's humanistic view of imaginative intuition. The motive of his literature of wit and satire is to express a point of view and to achieve an enlightement about man and nature by the use of unitive knowledge.
While Brave New World is a kind of prophetic novel, portraying the tragic misery resulting from the hubris of scientific technology, Brave New World Revisited is a collection of critical essays about real problems in the modem world, suggesting the education for freedom as an antidote against inhuman mechanization. Propter in After Many a Summer Dies a Swan is similar to Bruno in Time Must Have a Stop in their self-awareness of and search for the divine ground of every existence. Huxley's exploration of the Clear Light and the Ground in his scientific and philosophical essays continues in The Doors of Perception and The Perennial Philosophy.
Ape and Essence, another anti-utopian novel, illuminates the fundamental difference between human integrity and bestial degradation. In the devastated city of Los Angeles caused by the Thing after the Third World War, Dr. Poole liberates himself from the psychological obsession with his mother and escapes from the primitive dictatorship with Loola to a new world of love. Island is a final crystallization of Huxley's Utopian vision, based on the Oriental philosophies of Hinduism, Zen Buddhism, Taoism and other mysticism. Will Farnaby is transformed from a sceptic agent of western industrial colonization to the initiate of spiritual disciplines for the serene union with the God; universal love and compassion. Aldous Huxley's message is the harmonious compromise between the Oriental tradition of comprehensive understanding and the Western heritage of analytic reasoning, making the best of the two opposites.",김효원,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107986042
『젊은 예술가의 초상』과 『소설가 구보씨의 일일』에서 활용된 의식의 흐름 기법 비교,"The stream of consciousness technique focuses on the inner side of the character and emphasizes on one’s subjective viewpoint which makes it possible to preserve autonomy and independence against the overwhelming and authoritative social forces. In this respect, James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Park Taewan’s A Day of a Novelist Mr. Gubo have many common aspects to analyze. To begin with, both texts set a writer-oriented person as the main character: Stephen who will grow into a writer, and Gubo who is a writer. In addition, the stream of consciousness technique plays an essential role for Stephen or Gubo to reveal their subjective inner thoughts in opposition to the external authority of various levels. In this process, Stephen or Gubo unfold their thoughts on the nature of literature by means of showing the creating processes of their texts. In other words, they show the process of converting their own experiences into their creative literature texts. Also, the innovative narrative methods, stylistic innovations, and language experiments in both texts emphasize the modernistic literary perspective of the two main characters. Stephen, who overcame British imperialism, Catholic religious oppression, and family obstacles, achieved his literary autonomy, proudly declaring that “I go to encounter for the millionth time the reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race” (275-76). Gubo also firmly makes up his mind “to write a really good novel” (157) after having realized that the most important thing in his life is creating a novel. In spite of the weakness that all the characters except the main character in both texts are given a secondary position, Joyce and Park created their own splendid modernistic text focusing on the subjective inner consciousness of the main character by means of the stream of consciousness technique.",이영심,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82363991

Specifically, the study focuses on the students’ experiences with ChatGPT during an English poem writing activity, in which two approaches were employed. The first approach involved students creating their own English poems using an English dictionary, while the second approach required students to use ChatGPT to rephrase their self-translated poems and edit the resulting output. The results indicated that students found the structured English poem writing activity at a basic level to be easy, but they preferred ChatGPT’s faster and more convenient process and its use of natural and sophisticated vocabulary, grammar, and poetic expression with poetic license. Students also reported that post-editing with ChatGPT resulted in more seamless and higher quality outputs than direct translation.

『위대한 개츠비』에 나타난 꿈의 실현과 사랑의 대속,"The purpose of this paper is to analyze realization of dream and redemption of love in The Great Gatsby. The condition of human life is to aspire and realize the dream, so it is natural for a man to pursue his own ideal. Such a dream enables a man to project himself towards his purpose of life, to heighten his subjective value of life. Gatsby made his appearance before Daisy when he achieved the success of rags-to-riches as ‘American Dream.’ Gatsby tried to redeem the romantic love with Daisy in Louisville in the process of realizing his own dream from the past. It appeared that she was too contaminated by a material life as much as Tom to enter the world of Gatsby’s dream. His extraordinary effort for love with Daisy kept him striving to make his dream real against time and reality steadily. Gatsby never doubted Daisy’ love for himself. But as a result of the Buchanans’ snobbish conspiracy to kill him, Gatsby was shot to death in his pool, waiting for Daisy to call him. But Gatsby’s future-oriented idealism beats on, forever, transcending his death and the realm of reality. Nick ascribes Gatsby’s greatness to his hopeful idealism. Gatsby’s dream made his life meaningful and glorious. His dream is the concept that includes the eternal love of human life, transcending time and space, life and death. Therefore, Gatsby can be really “Great” in that Gatsby’s love for his own is redeemed through the realization of his dream.",사공철,2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106260760

The corrupted nature of Hyde, Jekyll’s the other ego, is reflected in the mirror while Dorian's divided nature is reflected through the picture of him.

The egos have been created and formed as a result of the reflections of the trauma they experienced in their childhood. So they come to have dissociative identity disorder to defend themselves from mental or physical pain.

영어교육을 위한 인공지능(AI) 스피커의 활용과 교육적 가치에 관한 연구,"Recently, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) speaker realized by speech recognition and synthesis technology has fast become a supplementary instrument in various educational fields, including English education. The main purpose of this paper is to examine effective applications of an AI speaker (Google Home Mini) and its future potential for English learning and teaching. In order to achieve this goal, this study firstly provides an in-depth analysis of advantages and disadvantages of using an AI speaker from a cognitive and linguistic perspective. Then, it documents actual experiences of sixteen pre-service English teachers with an AI speaker for creating their own lesson plan. The results show that an AI speaker provides individualized learning beyond time and space limitations and increases the level of motivation and participation, introducing new and additional ways and methods for English education. In addition, it is helpful for pronunciation and speaking practices, in particular, because it lowers students’ affective filter and improves listening concentration. Although all participants perceived its effectiveness in a positive way, using an AI speaker for educational purposes has limitation in that it cannot provide human-like accuracy and spontaneous feedback. This is the reason why the use of an AI speaker has to be situated in well-designed learning activities, rather than making students have open-ended conversation with AI. Based on the findings, this paper sheds new lights on how capabilities of AI speaker technology make learning more engaging and teaching more artificially apprehendable.

한국인 EFL 학습자의 결정적 시기와 보편문법,"There has been a growing enthusiasm in Korea for the early education of English as a foreign language (EFL). The present study examined the validity of the Critical Period Hypothesis in terms of the Universal Grammar (UG), in three different types of learning contexts - first language (L1), second language (SL), and foreign language (FL) learning contexts. While previous research findings in L1 and SL learning contexts suggest that UG principles and parameters are accessible to language leamers only for the early years of lifetime, this article argues that their results - and even the methods - cannot be applied to EFL settings and that independent studies on the EFL context are required. It also proposes the recent UG notion of functional categories as the most appropriate subject in the discussion of Korean EFL learners' access to UG. Findings on foreign language contexts, including the author's own, strongly indicate that UG is not sensitive to learners' starting ages in FL settings. If young children in FL contexts cannot develop their interlanguage grammar based on UG, the existing teaching methods for young children should be revised.",한혜령,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3166407

In honor of the Society’s 30th anniversary, this article attempts to make suggestions for a publication project of the Society. The emergence of ChatGPT in the era of the ‘humanities crisis’ has paradoxically increased the value of the humanities. In the era when AI will become commonplace, the humanities must maintain its expertise as a discipline and fulfill the role of the humanities while keeping in mind the urgent concerns of the public. Following reflection on the roles of the humanities, my suggestions are as follows. First, each chapter of the monograph should include a ‘think about’ section to provide food for thought. This will help foster the power of thought and critical consciousness, the creativity to connect seemingly unrelated things, and empathy, which are the essences of the humanities. Second, the book should ideally address timely topics which are relevant to the social and cultural issues that surround us today. Third, I propose publishing a book that provides a chronological overview of an issue and allows us to see how it has changed over time. This will increase the ability to keep changing while looking at the big picture of the various pieces of information obtained through AI such as ChatGPT. Fourth, I suggest connecting the study of modern British and American fiction with other disciplines.

문학과 문학교육의 의미,"This article aims to draw pedagogical implications of English literature education under the EFL context by critically inquiring research trends on literature education in Anglophone academia. For the past sixty years, these trends narrow down to three salient viewpoints. First, a liberal education after World War II had focused on patriotism, logical thinking, and appreciations of something emotional in the textual grain. Second, the Civil Rights Movement and the subsequent Political Correctness have opened the way for reading against the textual grain. Third, literature education as a means of providing authentic language inputs for immigrants and adolescents has been stood out for the past twenty years. Since 2000, discussions about literature education has begun to leap over the limit of belles-lettres by comprising it under the larger boundary of literacy education in EFL context. In this vein, literacy does not strictly divide the text between literature and language education and the narrow boundary of text genres loses its validity. The learners can raise a sense of spontaneity so that they can creatively break apart many diverse means of communication from words to visual images and construct them on the basis of their own criteria. Thus, the meaning of literature can be defined as a relational web of diverse communicative means from which the learner can construct his or her own interpretations of the text.",이동환(Dong-hwan Lee),2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99878875
윌리엄 칼로스 윌리엄즈와 다다주의,"Williams is strongly attracted to Dadaism, one of the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century which characterizes negation of and rebellion against all the traditional artistic conventions. In fact, Dada, which erupted in Zurich in 1916 during the First World War, is a paradoxically destructive yet affirmative anti-art movement that ultimately tries to embody the idealistic world. Williams had an opportunity to witness Dada through an expatriate French painter, Marcel Duchamp, who then shook up the establishment art world in New York. Thus, he gradually comprehended the principles and techniques of Dadaism and could apply them to his own prose and poetry.
Above all, Dadaism means ""the release of SOMETHING"" for Williams' works. The ""Prologue"" to Korea in Hell has been regarded as a tribute to Marcel Duchamp. In addition, Williams stresses that Duchamp's ready-made such as ""Fountain"" provokes him to write ""-something new-something American."" In the ""Prologue,"" Williams states an imagination based on ""a more flexible, jagged resort."" This imagination strongly arouses Dadaistic imagination which subverts all the rational and logical order. With this imagination, Williams creates his own versions of Dadaist works such as Kora in Hell and Spring and All, which are regarded as his representative early prose and poetry. These works show his outstanding Dadaist techniques such as ""decompositions,"" ""automatic writings,"" ""collage,"" ""photomontage,"" etc.
Significantly, in the poems such as ""At the Faucet of June"" and ""Agonized Spires"" in Spring and All, Williams brilliantly uses violently clashing images, mixed metaphors, run-on sentences, rapidly shifting scenes with modern technology and city imagery so that they create the effect of ""collage"" and ""photomontage."" Accordingly, I believe that Williams could construct the indigenous American poetics which shows ""-something new- something American"" based on Dadaism.",심진호,2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19708312
"피나 바우쉬의 〈봄의 제전〉에 대한 정신분석적, 미학적 고찰","This study analyzed Pina Bausch’s the Rite of Spring in theories of Freud, Lacan and Benjamin. Pina Bausch was credited for introducing a new form of modern dance called ‘Tanztheater.’ She was praised for her harmonization of German Expressionism and American Modern Dance. She expressed a conflict between human desire, psycho-social compulsions and restrictions. In this aspect, Bausch and her the Rite of Spring were regarded to take choreography to a new level. Her choreography well demonstrated primary impulse of human beings as well as death drive. The real, drive and impulse were expressed through montage/collage techniques in her works. The compulsive repetition of movement generated uncanny feeling and anxiety throughout a dance. Dance lifted the body to the das Ding and in this process, movement of the fragmented part-drive was repeated and then these pieces were combined to create a system of meaning. Her dance and choreography are similar to analytic setting. Pina Bausch sought epistemological grounds which can face ‘the end of analysis.’ Such distance making was associated with the creation of ‘new aura.’ Her dancing was a symbolized act and gave a structure and order to this chaotic world.",박선영(Seon-young Park),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105967213
외모문화와 시대욕망,"Cultivating bodily and facial appearance according to desirable image has become one of the dominant cultural phenomena, and the desire for appearance one of the dominant desires of the age(Zeitwunsch). Based on Lacanian psychoanalytic theory of subject and desire, the current paper will examine Korean appearance-cultivating desire and phenomena, which are overdetermined by multiple elements. The main targets of the current appearance cultivation are body and face. Cultivating the body focuses on weight-losing and body-shaping, and cultivating the face on making eye-lids, nose, or chins look desirable by plastic surgery. The desire of the subject for such desirable appearances is, psychoanalytically speaking, the desire to make himself look like the image which is provided for him by the symbolic Other and with which he identifies and which he internalizes into his ideal ego. The desire operates in metonymy and metaphor. The metaphoric working on the subject of multiple symbolic codes or discourses of mass media, gender ideology, visual culture, physiognomical culture, Western beauty ideal, and Korean collectivist culture result in the appearance-cultivating phenomena. The appearance cultivation has two categories. The first category is that the subject accepts the ideal image of the Other into his own ideal ego and his identification with such ideal ego image is not much libidinalized and his fantasy about it is not fixated; in such fantasy, the symbolic and the imaginary are much involved but the real is not. The second category is that the subject has a very strong fantasy about the appearance ideal ego in which the symbolic, the imaginary, and the real work together and he feels great pleasure. The second category also has two types. The first is the happy type in which the subject enjoys the agreement between his appearance ideal ego and his actual appearance. The second is the troubled type in which the subject feels radical difference between his appearance ideal ego and his actual appearance and is addicted to appearance cultivation, which is usually accompanied by serious pain or symptom. Plastic surgery addiction and anorexia are examples of this type. In order that desire for appearance does not result in serious symptom or pain and that healthy and diverse appearance-cultivating cultures develop themselves, every subject should be allowed to pursue his own appearance, with his own uniqueness being respected. It is the time to build the culture of appearance democracy in which each subject enjoys his own appearance without being discriminated or judged.",정경훈(Kyunghoon Jung),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108068561

"""위대한""개츠비를 위한 서술기법","This study examines various narrative methods employed by Fitzgerald who tries to present a seemingly immoral character, Gatsby, in a sympathetic and favorable light. Through the effective use of repetitious narration, done by Nick and other character narrators such as Gatsby, Jordan, Wolfshiem, and Henry Gatz, of Gatsby`s dream of new identity and his dream of Daisy, Fitzgerald conveys the transcendental spirit at the bottom of Gatsby`s materialism which renders Gatsby`s materialism tragic rather than shallow. Another narrative technique is the use of juxtaposition. By juxtaposing and dramatically contrasting the corrupt materialism of Tom/Daisy with Gatsby`s romantic idealism, Fitzgerald makes Gatsby a tragic hero. While juxtaposing Tom/Daisy and Gatsby, he develops a story of Nick`s changing attitude toward Gatsby. With a major modification of his initial judgments, Nick is guiding the reader to a similar moral evaluation of the characters. Furthermore, Fitzgerald shows Wilson`s killing of Gatsby and his subsequent suicide are ""holocaust"" of two innocent people and their deaths are tragic waste, thereby gaining sympathy for Gatsby. For this, he creates suspense and urgency through repetitious shift of time, multiple perspective, and the reordering of events, encouraging readers to participate actively in the narrative process leading to dramatic catastrophe. Fitzgerald uses various experimental narrative methods to persuasively characterize Gatsby as a ""great"" man. He creates a tightly knit, highly organized narrative structure as well. The pioneering narrative technique eventually plays a pivotal role in making The Great Gatsby a ``great`` American novel.",고영란 ( Young Ran Koh ),2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103952006
영어교육에서 중간언어의 중요성,"In order to obtain a better understanding of L2 learners, transitional knowledges, it is very important and necessary to have a better knowledge of interlanguage. According to Corder, the role of interlanguage in English education holds significance to ⑴ for language teachers, ⑵ for language learners themselves, and ⑶ for language textbook compilers. To me the significance of interlanguage in English education can be described in terms of not only language teachers, learners themselves, textbook writers and compilers but pure linguists, applied linguists, school authorities as well as parents. For language learners themselves a clear understancing of interlanguage results in students being receptive to language input, and the avoidance of mental block. and low levels of foreign language anxiety.
Native speakers of English (NSE) reflect not only linguistic features but also psychological, socio-linguistic, and discourse features when engaged in communication activities. This means that L2 learners are introduced to these different features, especiall, pragmatic features which are different from their mother tongue or L1 when engaged in communication with NSE. Hence the importance of interianguage pragmatics should be recognized.
It is very important that teachers of English should have a better understanding of interlanguage and present L2 learners with their interlanguage features so they can avoid any misunderstandings such features may cause when conversing with NSS. It should also be noted that interlanguage can form the foundation of language acquisition theory and linguistic analysis.",박경자,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107170228
'부조리극'으로서의 『고도를 기다리며』에 대한 재고,"The purpose of this study is to elucidate Waifing Waiting for Godot in another perspective. Generally Waiting for Godot is called as ""the theatre of the absurd."" Most of people have recognized it natural. This kind of interpretation is owing to the Esslin's naming to the play. But it isn't right enough. When I look into the details of the play in terms of structure, it is well connected interactively.
So I study the structure of this play in terms of dramatic structure. Because the dramatic structure is essential and important to understand and validate the drama itself. Dramatic structure is composed of the temporal structure, spatial structure and thematic structure. The temporal structure of this play is about the waiting for Godot. There is the passage of time from the beginning to the end. The elements of the temporal structure of this play are the leaves of a tree, the physical transformation of Pozzo and Luck etc. And also this play retains the direction of time. But it is different form traditonal plays.
This play has the spatial structure. There are no distinct origin, profession, age etc of the characters. And also there is no direction or goal in life. Because they don't find the meaning of life. So they becomes inactive.
The thematic structure is concerned with the waiting for Godot. The waiting is their purpose of life now. They don't leave the open space here---stage itself and existential space because of waiting for Godot. This Play Presents the human condition dramatically. The human existential conditions are the meaninglessness, no meaning of life, the disbelief of the life's meaning, the lack of life's purpose, the loss of ideal, the despair and disillusion about life and inactivity. Most of other dramas are to show the themes. But Waiting for Godot is different from any other traditional plays in the thematic presentation. So that Waiting for Godot is not absurd drama anymore.",서용득,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108110084

It was hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in both short-term and long-term memory between the two groups. Looking at the results, there was a significant difference in the immediate post-tests between the groups. While the use of song in vocabulary teaching did not have a considerable impact on the short-term memory of the participants, there was a significant difference found between the groups in the delayed post-tests. This indicates that the use of song has a great influence on transferring a short-term memory into a long-term memory. These findings suggest that the use of a song in teaching Korean vocabulary may aid in the acquisition and memorization of vocabulary. These would make a great contribution to developing teaching materials and learning strategies for KSL learners.",김혜민(Hyemin Kim),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107306493
『위대한 개츠비』와 『호밀밭의 파수꾼』에 드러난 아메리칸 드림의 좌절과 방황,"This paper focuses on two American novels, The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye. Both novels revise the meaning of an individual’s quest for identity in America, and while the two works show an ideal progression of identity focused on hope, this paper questions whether or not they should be regarded as hopeful. In The Great Gatsby, Fitzgerald tries to find the ideal values of American dream by chronicling the progress of Gatsby, and also by defending the narrator Nick Carraway. But Gatsby’s ideals are deteriorated by his material success, and the meaning of his ideals is distorted by the weird hopeless moths. Meanwhile, in The Catcher in the Rye, Salinger criticizes American society as conformist hopeless through Holden Caulfield’s wandering and resistance. Most peripheral characters in The Catcher in the Rye stay absurd and phoney through the eyes of Caulfield. He fails to view the world as it is, and his process of wandering is mystified. From these points of view, the reader may find frustration and wandering included within the process of establishing identity, and may also find that certain aspects of the American Dream are nothing more than fictitious propaganda.

"현대 여성의 새로운 히스테리, 거식증: 여성의 몸과 욕망","This paper aims to explore how the emaciated body of the anorectic presents itself as a caricature of the contemporary ideal of hyper-slenderness for women, an ideal that has become the cultural norm for women today. First, this paper points out how anorexia can be described as the twentieth-century version of hysteria. This paper focuses on the characteristics of anorexia from psychoanalytic perspectives. Further, this paper examines how anorexia may provide a paradigm of one way in which potential resistance is not merely undercut but utilized in the maintenance and reproduction of existing power relations. Susie Orbach interprets anorexia as a species of unconscious feminist protest in a most articulate and forceful way. The anorectic is engaged in a ""hunger strike,"" as Orbach calls it, stressing that this is a political discourse. Susan Bordo similarly argues that the anorectic is unaware that she is making a political statement. Through embodied rather than deliberate demonstration, she exposes and indicts those ideals, precisely by pursuing them to the point at which their destructive potential is revealed for all to see. Finally, while many feminist theorists read anorexia as protest or resistance against patriarchal power, this paper analyzes the problems of such feminist theoretical arguments, defending Sandra Lee Bartky`s notion of anorexia. Bartky analyzes how the anorectic becomes, just as surely as the inmate of the Foucauldian Panopticon, a self-policing subject, committed to a relentless self-surveillance. This self-surveillance is a form of obedience to patriarchy, conforming to the cultural messages that we inscribe upon our own bodies.",박주영 ( Joo Young Park ),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108728726
스크립트(script) 기반 언어ㆍ문화 통합 수업 방안,"This study provides an instructional model based on daily script, rather than drama canon, as one of the ways of revitalizing drama education. So as to build up the theoretical background of the model, the study reviews the concept and theory of script as compared to those of schema and drives the use of script-based English learning by examining the relevance of script to language acquisition. And the study creates both the Korean and the English script of “going to a restaurant” for an example and extracts script actions and sub-actions revealing intercultural differences by comparing and analyzing both scripts. Then, the study makes dialogues for each scene by dramatizing the restaurant script according to the script actions that show the cultural differences, thereby providing an instructional model for the integration of language and culture education based on script acquisition.
The study suggests the need for extending drama text to the concept of script, or dramatic text, including all kinds of text having a dramatic form, to overcome the problems of the current drama education. According to the definition of script, script includes not only drama or movie script but also listening and speaking script in school textbooks and English conversation materials. More importantly, it involves everyday script, such as going to the movies and going to see a doctor, which is very useful for improving English competence from the perspective of language acquisition.
Daily script is considered procedural knowledge in terms of cognitive psychology, which is to function as social schema. It is internalized in human beings and works as a frame of memory, thereby making daily communication possible. For example, the restaurant script consists of the procedures of entering a restaurant, ordering the food, eating the food, and paying the bill, and these procedures are socially standardized ritual, without which communication in the restaurant is not possible. Daily script is also closely connected to cultural value. It is different cultural value that makes the script of “going to see a doctor,” for instance, differ from country to country. Naturally, learning the difference between the source culture and the target culture using script contributes to the improvement of students’ intercultural communicative competence.
The script-based instruction can enhance students’ understanding of drama as a genre and at the same time students’ English communicative and intercultural competence. In this model drama canon directly from English literature is not treated, but everyday script, like drama, has dramatic dialogues and actions and events that are developed in time sequence, so that it is possible to use dramatic techniques, such as role play, in class. The concept of script as dramatic text in daily life will be the alternative to drama education in EFL contexts like Korea.",김경한(Kyong-Hahn Kim),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60055673
아메리칸 드림의 재현 방식: 피츠제럴드의 『위대한 개츠비』와 웨스트의 『미스 론리하츠』 연구,"This paper aimed at revaluing the meaning of American Dream by examining the novels of 1920s and 1930s, The Great Gatsby and Miss Lonelyhearts. The Great Gatsby showed the ideal values of American Dream by the various aspects of American society. Though we tried and defined the positive meaning of American Dream from the novel, but the process of Gatsby’s dream had negative ways for pursuing it. And the absurdities of the American society after the materialization made their lives degenerated from their ethics for hope and success. From those point of view, we might find the dual representation for the reality of American Dream in The Great Gatsby. And in Miss Lonelyhearts, West presented the hopeless American society of the 1930s by the superrealistic description for the hideous reality after the Great Depression period. Miss Lonelyhearts wrote the columns to save the minds of the people, but the real intention of the columns were distorted by the materialistic desire. West described this absurd reality from the disgusting and frightful representation for the American society at that era. In conclusion, we might find some aspects for the true meaning of American dream that was just the way of expressing their ideal hope without reality. And the novels examined in this article presented the opposing way of understanding the reality of American ideals and their society.",박용준,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102838039
「위대한 개츠비」에 나타난 미국의 꿈과 상징성 연구,"This paper aims to elucidate the American dream and symbolism in The Great Gatsby. My concern is with how the whole career of Gatsby is related with the American dream and its failure. The major symbols such as the East and the West, the valley of ashes, and the green light have very important functions to represent Gatsby's dream and failure which is identified with American experience.
The East and the West, East Eggers and West Eggers, for example, stands for the moral situation of the characters in each region. When early explorers escaped the corruption of the old world to establish a new ideal in America, they went from east to west. Since the ideal has been corrupted, people travel from west to east, attracted by the wealth and sophistication. They lose traditional moral virtues of the West except Nick who appreciates traditional moral enviroment of his home at the Middle West. The valley of ashes represents the spiritual desolation of modern world and the eyes of Dr. Eckleburg represents some kind of detached intellect, brooding gloomily over on the bleak wasteland surrounding it, and presiding over the tragedy of the characters.
The green light in the last paragraph of the novel which reminds us of Gatsby's dream for Daisy is compared to the new world, the promise of America for the Dutch sailors, and the wasteland of Long Island of the 1920s. So Gatsby's whole career is finally made into a metaphor for the American experience.",엄광웅,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76518126

문학과 공감 능력: 심리학으로 들여다 본 문학의 사회적 · 교육적 가치,"This study aims to introduce the latest findings in psychology about the power of empathy through reading literature and to discuss the educational value of literature related to empathy. Empathy, the cognitive, emotional, and communicative ability to respond to others’ feelings, is the basis of our daily social interactions. Empathy enables us to analyze, judge, and reason the behaviors of others. It is believed that human beings are born with basic empathy skills and gradually develop them as they grow up. Empathy can be approached in two concepts: attitude of life, or communicative skills. Recently, as empathy as an attitude of life has been more focused, literature has been used in empathic education, which is based on the hypothesis that understanding literary characters would be similar to understanding people in real life. In other words, reading literature is not other than training empathic attitude of life. This interest has led to four psychological researches involving literature and empathy: 1) the social values presented by the novel have the potential to reduce social prejudice in real life, 2) people who read a lot of novels are more likely to have empathic skills and social acumen than non-fiction reader, 3) the more literary fictions you read (not popular fictions), the better your empathy and other social skills will be promoted, 4) multi-perspective novels have the great potential to facilitate the reading of others’ minds. These psychological researches on literature and empathy generally suggest that literary works, especially narratives, can have a positive social impact on readers by improving their ability to read others’ minds. These researches are surely believed to provide scientific evidence for the social, educational value of literature, and it is also expected that literary works will be more actively used in empathic education.",김영미(Youngmee Kim),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3431189
패턴 시 쓰기 활동 기반 영미시 교육,"  This paper develops a teaching-learning model for English and American poetry, based on pattern poetry writing, that highlights direction for the teaching of English poetry in an EFL environment. The model emphasizes the use of English poetry as a genre instead of learning English poetry canon, and thus targets the improvement of learner English competence rather than literary education.<BR>  Research in this field has mainly focused on construction of a method or a strategy for effective reading and response; however, this paper approaches poetry teaching from practical pattern poetry writing. Though the main activity of this proposed model is poetry writing, it interacts all four skills of English learning, that is, listening (chanting), speaking (pronouncing and discussing), reading (reciting), and writing (writing of poetry). By learning the principles of versification or prosody of English poetry and practicing writing simple pattern poems based on them, learners ascertain rhythmic pattern proper to English poetry and effectual English vocabulary. In addition, learners not only understand and delight in English poetry as a genre, but also acquire basic literary competence. In short, pattern poetry writing makes learners feel closer to English learning.<BR>  If a poem is useful for English learning and suitable to the level of learners, it does not matter whether it is a canon or not. Approaching English poetry in view of English learning relatively frees instructors from the consideration of teaching English poetry canon, and such orientation of English poetry teaching is a natural result from the viewpoint of language learner literature.",김경한(Kyong Hahn Kim),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60094449
거짓으로서의 영화: 영화의 매체특정성에 대한 고찰,"With this study of cinema as falsehood, I examine the cinematic media-specificity through analyzing various aspects of cinema in comparison with literature and drama. My discussion of the falsity of cinema ranges from Bazin, Deleuze, Ranciere, Badiou to Benjamin. With these representative thinkers in the 20th century, I will show the way in which cinema gains the power to create fictional world by taking real images from the world, which in turn explains a sense of incongruity and impurity to cinematic realism. Specifically, Badiou’s elaboration of false movements and Ranciere’s idea of the power of the film fable will help us clarify some important problems of thought-image raised by Deleuze.
On the textual level, I will focus on some cases of cinematic construction of novels and theaters in order to prove the power of the Other as cinematic media-specificity. The cinema produces its own presentness with a multiple type of camera’s mediation so as to create a space for viewing subject. In the viewing experience or within the cinematic space, the subject fulfills his/her ambivalent need to see the world from the center and at the same time to be seen from the side of the world in a reversed way. From these false spaces and movements, this essay provides the ways in which cinema constructs and deconstructs congruous space, which is equivalent to the impure power of philosophical of thinking: that is the ability to embrace the Other. In this sense, the cinematic power of the false is in fact its power of truth. This power determines the future of images and cinema.",남수영,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19617255
인간성과 인공지능의 경계: 가즈오 이시구로의 『클라라와 태양』 연구,"Kazuo Ishiguro, born in Japan in 1954 but raised in England, explores the boundaries of human nature and artificial intelligence in his latest work, Klara and the Sun(2021). With the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Ishiguro raises questions and concerns about the coexistence of AI and humans, throwing profound inquiries into the dignity, existence, and essence of humanity that may arise from future technological advancements. Klara, an AF(Artificial Friend), wondered if AFs were happy with their child and with their home and she would feel pain alongside her happiness. Klara possesses distinguishably cognitive sensitivity that other robots lack and raises questions about the relationship between humans and robots and about the robot’s own identity. Through the questions posed by Klara, Ishiguro emphasizes the recovery of humanity and ethical consciousness through Krissie, Josie’s mother, who manipulates Klara to become Josie.

플래퍼와 1920년대 미국 문화의 여성 이미지: 피츠제럴드를 중심으로,"The flapper was seen as a popular female type of the 1920s of America. This paper examines this prevalent image of a modern young woman who had a short but intense life in American culture, by reading some works of Scott F. Fitzgerald. Best known as an epitome and a chronicler of the 1920s, Fitzgerald arguably invented and popularized the flapper image in America. This paper focuses on three short stories collected in Flappers and Philosophers (1920), ""Head and Shoulders"", ""Bernice Bobs Her Hair,"" ""The Offshore Pirate,"" and The Great Gatsby (1925), his most celebrated work. As is well shown in naming the age as the ""Roaring Twenties"" and people as the ""Lost Generation,"" the postwar America underwent disorientation, turbulence, and disorder, totally having lost traditional value system. Reflecting such social changes, the flapper, as a type of the New Woman, liberated herself from the constricting identity defined by domestic ideology, and rebelliously defied traditional conventions of female virtues. Fitzgerald created vibrant female characters who are spoiled, sexually liberal, self-centered, and fun-loving, not confined to the home, but enjoy individual freedom. As such, they seemed to overcome the previous conceptions of women as `invalids` who had been represented to become ill, degenerate, and ultimately die. Fitzgerald has long been misconstrued as a spokesman for celebrating this new type of women, but his attitude was nuanced and ambivalent. He increasingly used her as a symbol not only of freedom but also of social conflict and unrest. Although Fitzgerald himself created a flapper with complexities, a more standardized flapper image instantly allured and influenced young women of the era on a wide scale, and it was popularized and spread by a stream of popular magazines, advertisements, and movies. As its popularity increased, the flapper quickly turned into a stereotypical type of woman who temporarily enjoys freedom and rebellion but finally decides to settle down to a safe home. In short, the flapper was an outright expression of individual freedom and liberated energy in one respect, and yet in the other, she served as a safe receptacle for containing social anxiety and disorder. In the aftermath of its paradoxical cultural significance, the spirit of subversion is safely contained in repetitive literary representations of modern women who are yet invalids and/or die, sexually oppressed by social restrictions which are still to be overcome long after the 1920s.",손정희 ( Jeong Hee Sohn ),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105405412
세 가지 신탁과 세 갈래 길: 『오이디푸스 왕』에 나타난 운명과 자유의지,"Oedipus the King represents the process of awakening of Oedipus, who is seeking answers to his identity and the secrets implied in oracles. Oedipus recognizes the harsh reality of oracles and his own identity through extreme suffering. There are three oracles in the play. Oedipus hears at Apollo’s temple in Delphi that he is destined to marry his mother and murder his father. Jocasta mentions the oracle Laius heard in the past that his son would kill him. Creon conveys the oracle’s message that the murderer of King Laius must be expelled to remove the plague from Thebes. These three oracles mentioned by Oedipus, Jocasta, and Creon, are related to the symbolic meaning of the triple crossroads. The spot where three roads meet is the place where Oedipus and Laius met. Crossroads are a traditional symbol of choice, the decision on which way to go, representing past, present, and future. Oedipus makes a fateful decision, the killing of his father, at the crossroads. Oedipus’ fate was predetermined from birth, but he is not a human being without free will. This paper discusses the relationship between fate and free will, focusing on the symbolic meaning of the three oracles and the triple crossroads.",김종환,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106869431

Some say it is beyond human while some say it is a superhuman. However critical posthumanists say it is what we are or will be. Critical posthumanists like Katherine Hayles, Rosi Braidotti and Cary Wolfe think posthuman includes humans, animals, artificial intelligence, and superhumans. We are all posthumans as living individuals because the border between human and machine has been bridged with prosthetics, artificial organs and artificial intelligences. The hybridity is a characteristic of posthuman, which can be easily seen in Frankenstein. Victor Frankenstein as well as his creature shows this hybridity.

탈신체 시대의 과학기술 : 사이버펑크 서사로 읽는 과학기술의 사회학과 21세기 미국의 새로운 지평,"This essay explores the sociological aspects of the race-technology nexus in American culture during the twenty-first century, especially in regard to the formation of race within technoculture. The cultural shift from the industrial economy in the previous century to the present technocultural reconstruction is being explored in different forms of cultural texts across the nation. In highlighting the shifting politico-cultural milieu, this article focuses on how cyberpunk has evolved to represent social, cultural, and political dynamics of race; while cyberpunk texts in the 80s and 90s mainly depicted the identity crises of humankind and class struggles in a high-tech society, cyberpunk in the twenty-first century brings the influences of post/trans-human technology and cybernetic culture on racial experiences to the center of technology discourse. Particularly, I investigate this trend across two different narratives in Oshii Mamoru's original Ghost in the Shell released in 1995 and Rupert Sanders's 2017 remake. Through representational revisions of a technocultural world, current cyberpunk texts establish posthuman narratives as a location for the exploration of racial experiences in the supposedly post-racial United States.",김명성 ( Kim¸ Myungsung ),2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103952757
로맨틱 햄릿 뒤집기,"It was in the 19th century that critics and intellectuals were busy constructing hierarchy about what kind of Hamlet was good and which one was bad. The example of good one was Wanderer above the Sea of Fog in Caspar David Friedrich’s painting the message of which conveyed Kantian self-reflection, expressed through the wanderer’s gazings into the murkiness of the sea of fog. Since then romantic Hamlets Coleridge, Young Werther, Kemble, Kean, Irving, Olivier, Branagh have made a similar climb perching upon the psychic ramparts of Elsinore. But the pendulum suddenly swang the other way as RSC took us on another speculative voyage catering for younger tastes attracted to Hamlet by the popularity of Tennant’s Doctor Who. Though high and low binary is out of date now RSC deliberately entered into the world of lowbrow Shakespeare by choosing quarto text, neoclassical revenge tragedy concept, method acting, and postmodern design concept, all of which could be justified in its own way. No recent stage production/film has attracted the excitement and nearly unanimous critical praise as Tennant’s Hamlet but the result was another manifestation of the contradictory nature of Shakespeare both institutionally marginal and symbolically central.",전준택(Joon-taek Jun),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2011158
캐서린/히스클리프의 트라우마: 『워더링 하이츠』 연구,"This study attempts to illuminate Catherine’s and Heathcliff’s trauma and its inner causality. The understanding of the outbreak and symptoms of trauma, and the recovery process of the two characters, reveal an inner causality in Heathcliff’s cruel revenge and his dramatic change into choosing a voluntary death, and also illuminate the inner logic in Catherine’s severe self-division after Heathcliff’s return and her derangement leading to her death. Catherine’s trauma begins when she experiences sudden separation from Heathcliff and self-division after staying at Thrushcross Grange. In her nervous derangement Catherine finally confronts her trauma. Not overcoming her trauma, however, she escapes to the fantasy of being together with Heathcliff in her childhood. She thereby tragically transcends the painful reality through her death. Heathcliff’s trauma begins with his sudden realization that he can never see Catherine despite his feeling her ghost around him. It leads him to take relentless revenge. While telling his story to Nelly, however, he can eventually understand the cause and meaning of his traumatic experience. The curing of his trauma leads him to realize the futility of his revenge and regain his original self. Therefore, Heathcliff’s eventual ecstatic unity with Catherine through his death can be a tragic achievement. The inner causality of their trauma is conveyed persuasively through the effective use of narrator/listener Nelly, observers’ points of view, and repetitive narration. This makes Wuthering Heights a unique work creatively synthesizing an ordinary realistic novel and romance.",고영란 ( Youngran Koh ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101590746
