One was the Meiji period When all subjects on the curriculum of the middle school and upwards were taught in English by Western teachers with books written in English, and the other the period of American occupation beginning with the end of the war, when the ability of spoken English was almost an essential condition for advancing one's career.In other times, the status of English was recognized only as one of the most important subjects of the examination for entrance into the university. This was a situation for which the grammar-translation method of teaching was the most effective, making it difficult for any communication-oriented method to be adopted in schools of formal educationThe national controversies, characteristic if English teaching in Japan, over whether English should be included in the curriculum of the middle school are traced partly to public dissatisfaction with the low level of English proficiency of high school and university graduates vis-a-vis the time spent on learning the foreign language,partly to nationalism of the Japanese people, and partly on the ideology of English education.English was introduced to Korea along routes different from the way it came to Japan. and had been taught to a small number of people by a communication-centered method until 1919, when Japan replaced with its own the traditional Korean educational system including English teaching. It can be said that English teaching in Korea actually started with the imposition of the Japanese educational system in Korea, and has thus inherited the Japanese tradition of English teaching. It is this historical background that makes the history and tradition of English teaching of Japan meaningful to us.It is revealed by this survey that progress in the teaching of foreign",조용남,1991,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2112155

For this purpose, 19 experimental studies are selected to conduct a meta-analysis, synthesizing the results of 51 individual study cases. The results of this study are as follows: First, it is found that the overall effect size of using chatbots is more than medium size meaning that a chatbot is an effective tool to learn English. Second, in the aspects of linguistic competence and affective categories, each shows over medium sizes like the overall effect size. In details of the dependent variables, vocabulary and speaking in linguistic competence and motivation in affective categories, large effect sizes are shown. Third, the effect sizes are getting larger, as the younger the students are, the longer the experiment period lasts, and the more purpose-built the chatbot is. But the differences in the effect sizes in terms of these moderators (e.g., school level, experiment period, and chatbot type) are not significant. Lastly, it is suggested that follow-up studies are needed to collect a sufficient number of experimental study cases and subdivide the variables for performing a more detailed meta-anlysis.",서소담,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108754503

The main reasons of their errors in pronunciation are induced from retroflexes and tone. Retroflexes cause the point of articulation to move more backwards that the point where real Korean sound is made. And tone influences the way a sound is articulated. Because of the influence of tone, Chinese learners tend to neglect the correct way of articulation in the mouth, even though it is an important factor in distinguishing Korean sounds. So for the teaching pronunciation, teachers should make the learners`` tongue to be flat to pronounce non-retroflexes. When teachers present the sounds and the way of articulation, by her or himself, it is more efficient than presenting it through other methods to change their habit to pronounce.",백소영 ( So Young Paik ),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A87014716

담화 분석을 통한 한국어 간접 인용 표현 교육 방안 연구,"With the increasing importance of speaking-centric communication skills in Korean education, more and more interest bas been invested in functional grammar in recent years. Grammar appears when language is actually used during a conversation from the perspective of functional grammar, being formed by various discourse factors outside the language structure. When taking that perspective to look at grammar, it is required to offer speech acts in which indirect quotation expressions are implemented and promote their natural uses instead of restricting them to sentence grammar. One of the important goals of grammar education is to help the students increase the ability to express a sentence of their intent by making proper use of a grammar item after studying it. If the students in the intermediate or advanced level fail to make proper use of indirect quotation expressions even after studying them, the teacher should check if there is any deficiency with educational content and method. In that sense, this study set out to examine what functions indirect quotation expressions would implement in spoken language with drama scripts and discuss what should be supplemented in the method by which to teach indirect quotation expressions in the current teaching materials for Korean education.",김지혜 ( Ji Hye Kim ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82420251
원인'과 '결과' 구문의 통사론 및 의미론적 고찰,"Causative construction has been worked upon from the syntactic point of view in many languages. In English, verbs such as 'make', 'let', and 'have' are considered syntactic causative verbs. The equivalent of 'do' and 'make' in other languages have often been used as the syntactic causative verbs.
Semantically, however, there is no reason why verbs such as 'order', 'request' cannot be causative verbs. Semantically causation includes a 'cause', and 'effect'. The causing event, 'cause' is frequently contained in the main clause and the desired event, 'effect ' in the embedded clause. When the main verb is, for instance, 'make' in an English causative sentence, it is not clear what the causing event may be although there must be a certain event which occurred to make the desired event happen. When the verb is 'order', it is a little clearer to understand what the causing event may be. The causer gives an order, verbally or in writing, which is intended to make the desired event happen.
In this paper, we argue that in case of Korean, there is a match between syntax and semantics in the causative construction as the same complementizer 'key' or' tolok' is used. This is very different from the case of English because in English three different syntactic structures are used - bare infinitive, to-infinitive, and 'in order that' clause. Japanese uses two different syntactic structures, one of them including a morphological process using a causative morpheme 'sase', and the other using a complementizer 'yooni'. Thai behaves rather Elte Korean in the sense that one element 'hay (give)' can be used to cover the entirety of the semantic causative phenomenon. One difference between Thai and Korean is, though, that in Thai there can be two other ways besides using 'hay' to express the syntactic causative construction, which are to use the verb 'tham (do)' or 'tham hay' together.
Based on what we have seen so far, we can have the following continuum of match-mismatch relation between syntax and semantics for the causative phenomenon.",김경안,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82367708
브라질 오순절 운동의 토착화,"This article is to look into transformation of the Brazilian pentecostalism in the process of development. To do this project, I prefer to use the categories of inculturation of Christianity.
For better understanding of pentecostalism of Brazil, I analyze a brief historical background of Brazilian Protestantism. Although the methodology of phenomenology of religion I use is largely ahistorical, its application does not deny or reject relevant historical facts for interpretation. And I intend to develop a preliminary understanding of two contextual aspects of pentecostalism in Brazil : the cultural aspect and the religious aspect. The cultural aspect influenced brazilian to accept new movement of Christianity, and the religious aspect led brazilian to make their own indigenous or syncretistic folk Christianity.
Among these different types of Brazilian Christianity, I find the indigenous religious patterns by using the categories of contextualization of religion: (1) syncretization of pentecostalism (2) weakness of speaking in tongues (3) emphasizing worship service of women (4) belief in empowerment of pastors as God's sacred people.

Seventeen studies met strict criteria for this review. The research was conducted by analyzing their participants, research methods, independent, dependent variable, and results. The results explained that hearing children born to deaf parents are often called CODAs or codas. Many of these hearing children grow up in a deaf-culture environment that ASL (American sign language) is a legitimate language for family interaction. So they are considered bimodal (two different modalities of sign and speech) bilingual and bicultural in that they potentially share the language and culture of their Deaf parents. Some studies related CODA have been expressed serious concern about the potential for spoken language delay base upon the presumption that the child lacks adequate speech input in the home environment. and other studies have been concluded that CODA do develop speech and language normally.

En Europa esta e′poca finisecular y novosecular ha sido marcada por el predominio del arte modernista. Parece un camino necesario y efectivo, a nuestro propo′sito de clarificar las bases del arte y la culture finisecular de Espan～a, identificar ante todo lo que diferencia el Modernismo hispa′nico del Modernism europeo ; el uno se refiere a un movimiento que se inicia con el contacto con el simbolismo france′s y se propaga en toda la Hispanoame′rica y Espan～a durante la primers mitad del siglo XX, y el otro, te′rmino general referente a la nueva era de las industri′as, las ideas y las artes que veni′a forma′ndose desde la e′poca ilustrada intensificadas aun ma′s en los u′ltimos dos siglos.

『백년의 고독』,"Hoy en dia, los criticos coreanos tienen mucho interes en 『Cien anos de soledad』 de Gabriel Garcia Marquez. En los anos noventa la mayoria de los escritores coreanos tratan de escribir obras fantasticas para huir de la realidad. Pero Hwang Suk-Young ha buscado una posibilidad nueva de la literatura fantastica en su obra 『El visitante』. En esta obra el escritor intenta curar el trauma de la guerra civil coreana, haciendo vivir los muertos con los vivos. Los criticos coreanos han aplaudido a esta obra porque ha buscado una nueva posibilidad en las obras realistas. Sin embargo, la convivencia de seres reales con seres irreales, es una de las caracteristicas tipicas de 『Cien anos de soledad』.
『Cien anos de soledad』de Gabriel Garcia Marquez, es la historia de la victoria y caida de la familia Buendia durante cien anos, y esta construida en tres grandes partes: la epoca de las mitologias, de las historias y de la literatura. En <la epoca de las mitologias>, que es una prehistoria de Macondo, el autor nos muestra tres codigos importantes para entender toda la historia de la obra. Primero, el nos narra el nacimiento y el miedo de la caida de la familia Buendia y de Macondo por el incesto; el segundo, su encuentro con la cultura extranjera que causara la caida de Macondo; y el ultimo, la historia oral de Francisco. <La epoca de las historias> trata dos conflictos que occurieron realmente en la historia colombiana, en dos heroes. La historia del coronel Aureliano Buendia es la historia de la guerra de mil dias y la de Jose Arcadio Segundo, de la huelga de los bananeros en Cienaga. En Colombia, hay dos movimientos revolucionarios en cien anos.
Los revolucionarios colombianos intentan construir la Utopia Liberal en la segunda parte del siglo ⅩⅠⅩ y la Utopia socialista en los comienzos del siglo ⅩⅩ. Garcia Marquez nos narra el proceso y la caida de los dos movimientos reales en la obra. <La epoca de la literatura> tiene relacion con la autobiografia de Garcia Marquez. En esta epoca el autor nos narra dos trabajos principales, uno es el trabajo de Aureliano Babilonia y el segundo, el amor autentico de los amantes. Aureliano Babilonia se metio en una habitacion cerrada para resolver los manuscritos de Melquiades. Este acto nos muestra que Aureliano tiene caracter de los intelectos que tratan buscar las causas y respuestas de la realidad colombiana.
El mito del incesto es el codigo principal de 『Cien anos de soledad』. Toda la historia de Macondo tiene relacion con este mito. Todos los hombres tienen deseo del incesto; las mujeres, miedo de la caida por el incesto. Pero, hay que romper este miedo para construir la nueva sociedad. El mito del incesto se perpecto cuando regreso el nuevo representante Amaranta Ursula despues de la muerte de Ursula. Aureliano y Amaranta Ursula son los seres mas felices del mundo por el amor autentico, y su cosecha, el ultimo Aureliano que tiene cola ed cerdo, no significa la caida fatal de Macondo sino el comienzo del nuevo mito y de la sociedad nueva.",김용호,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A97762920
스페인어 초급수준 학습자를 대상으로 한 PBL 활용 스페인어 청취 수업,"Unlike the PBL-based listening lessons conducted twice, this study is the operation and results of the classes for beginner level Spanish learners. They were beginner level learners prior to their Spanish acquisition experience in Mexico, so we prepared a lecture class to help them perform PBL tasks. Rather than preparing something new, we reviewed and used some of the very basic things we had learned in the past, and made sure that the topics in Module 1 and 2 were linked. For the PBL effect research method, we choose a hybrid research method that integrates quantitative and qualitative methods, which is a method to enhance the validity of the research and is based on a practical statement about self-directed learning ability, which is the purpose of using PBL. As a result of pre-post survey analysis, the overall post-scores of both problem solving ability and cooperative efficacy were significantly higher than pre-scores. In all five sub-domains of problem solving ability, post-score scores were higher than in pre-scores, and the four sub-fields of cooperative efficacy increased. In terms of class satisfaction, ‘enough time and effort devotion’ and ‘helping to deepen their major knowledge’ were the highest. Through the analysis of the reflection journals in Modules 1 and 2, it was found that the students' listening experience in Spanish, which is the biggest learning goal of the subject, was achieved through direct contact with native speakers and subtitle processing of interview videos during the PBL assignment, and that they were able to develop self-directed learning methods by considering the existing learning methods by themselves while recognizing the difficulty of listening or communicating during the assignment. It was also a positive factor that the burden of dialogue with foreigners was reduced through the experience of contact with native speakers during the assignment, and that they could understand the culture of Latin American countries.",심영식,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82367714
' 동사 + 명사 ' 합성어의 형태론적 분석,"Se denomina la formacio′n de palabras al conjunto de procesos morfosinta′cticos que permiten la creacio′n de nuevas unidades a partir de morfemas le′xicos. Para former las palabras, se utilizan los afijos de derivacio′n o los diversos procedimientos de composicio′n. Es decir, se crean nuevas palabras sobre la base de las existentes por los procedimientos ma′s fa′ciles, que son la derivacio′n y la composicio′n. La composicio′n es up procedimiento de crear nuevas palabras que se presta a muchas discusiones porque no todas las lenguas lo manejan con la misma libertad. La descripcio′n y clasificacio′n de las formas que la estructura de una lengua nos lleva a describir como palabras compuestas, dependera′ de los rasgos caracteri′sticos de esta lengua. Por lo tanto, los rasgos gramaticales que nos llevan a reconocer las palabras compuestas difieren en las distintas lenguas, y algunas lenguas carecen de este tipo de formas. En espan～ol, las palabras compuestas suelen dividirse en diferentes grupos, segu′n la naturaleza de sus elementos romponentes. Entre ellos, los compuestos ma′s abundantes son los de `verbo ma′s nombre`: abrecartas, cortaviento, lavacoches, matafuego, rompecabezas, saltamontes, etc. El tipo de composicio′n consiste en que dos palabras, tales como `romper`(verbo) y `cabezas`(nombre), que significan cosas distintas, se unen para formar una tercera: rompecabezas. El tipo, que no es heredado del lati′n, es caracteri′stico de las lenguas roma′nicas y esta′ ampliamente representado en todas panes dentro de la Romania: Estos compuestos, cuya categori′a gramatical es nombre, constituyen un puente entre la morfologi′a y la sintaxis, puesto que se trata de elementos que, en su origen, eran palabras distintas y, despue′s, partes de una misma unidad le′xica. Estos compuestos tienen dos formas libres o separables entre sus constituyentes inmediatos, y las construcciones de estos compuestos son las ma′s semejantes a la construccibn sinta′ctica. El primer componente de estos compuestos se parece a una forma verbal conjugada: la historia pretende hacernos ver imperativo, pero la idea del imperative se ha olvidado y nadie ve ni imperativo ni otro tiempo alguno. En conclusion, este tipo de composicio′n procedio′ de las frases imperativas, pero hoy no tiene la idea del imperativo: solamente por causa de la energi′a latente del modelo romance se han formado los compuestos. En estos compuestos, el nombre es normalmente plural, pero puede ser singular, especialmente si es el nombre masivo o incontable. Y el plural de los dos tipos tiene la misma secuencia [verbo+nombre+morfema de plural], pero sus estructuras se diferencian, y podemos entender una interaccio′n entre composicio′n y flexio′n nume′rica. Si intentamos representar esquema′ticamente el modelo ma′s socorrido y general de formar estos compuestos, obtenemos el siguiente esquema: [elemento verbal+nombre+-(e)s]. Este modelo esta′ contribuyendo a formar una infinidad de palabras. Como procedimiento de formacio′n de palabras, el tipo de composicio′n de `verbo y nombre` es caracteri′stico de las lenguas roma′nicas, y los compuestos son numerosos como formaciones populates y ocasionales. La frecuencia en el lenguaje coloquial de los compuestos de `verbo y nombre` indica que se trata de un procedimiento de creatividad le′xica cuya vitalidad excede las restricciones del lexico′n establecido. En el sistema lingu¨i′stico virtual, este tipo de composicio′n es esencialmente ide′ntico en las lenguas roma′nicas y es comu′n a toda la Romania. En espan～ol, el modelo es productivo diacro′nieamente, comp lo testimonian distintas documentaciones recogidas a lo largo de la historia de la literatura espan～ola y, en te′rminos generales, resulta un procedimiento de formacio′n de palabras muy popular.",유연창 ( Yeon Chang You ),1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A87014762

스페인어 청취 교육에서의 섀도잉 활용에 관한 연구,"This study analyzes the difficulties experienced by undergraduate learners majoring in Spanish in advanced listening and their needs in listening classes, and proposes a teaching method that incorporates shadowing practice for improving listening skills. Shadowing began to be known as a basic practice for simultaneous interpretation, and has been widely introduced as a teaching method for improving listening skills and speaking fluency in foreign language education. Domestic research on shadowing has mostly focused on its use as a teaching method for improving listening skills of learners in EFL (English as a Foreign Language) or KFL (Korean as a Foreign Language) courses, excluding professional interpretation education. This study, however, examines whether the assumption that shadowing practice helps learners improve their ability for bottom-up information processing by developing repeated phonemic awareness of auditory input is also valid for advanced listening practice for undergraduate Spanish learners. For the purpose of the study, shadowing was incorporated in listening classes for Spanish majors who have completed Spanish language courses of intermediate or higher levels, and the learners were surveyed about difficulties experienced in listening and benefits of shadowing in learning achievement. Survey results demonstrated the necessity and validity of shadowing in Spanish learning for improving the ability for bottom-up information processing in areas that learners often find challenging, such as pronunciation, speed and intonation.",김희진,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107964966
국어의 로마자 표기법 문제 종합 검토,"A non-technical system of Romanizing Korean. that is not a system for linguists, should facilitate for foreigners (mainly the English speakers) to learn how to pronounce words and sentences written in this system so that a Korean will recognize them when he hears them.
Although each system has its good and bad points, I think that the most suitable system for a Korean case should accept the principle of the phonetic representation that underlies the McCune-Reischauer system of Korean Romanization.
The Romanization of the Ministry of Education is still aesthetically ugly in spite of the recent changes regarding the writing of lthe vowels (from eo and eu to o and u)and th e judicious use of spellings closer to the phonetic shapes of words.

漢文 품사분류론 재론,"Abstract
The succession to traditional culture could be roughly divided two ways: one is through
literature, another through folk ways. To uphold the traditional culture through literature,
Koreans have to learn the Old Chinese because most transmitted Korean literature is
recorded in Chinese.

Chinese is a foreign language which is different from Korean especially in grammar. So,
to learn the language, we have to master its grammar. At this point, the establishment
of prescriptive grammar (school grammar) of Chinese comes into question, which has
never been discussed to my knowledge since I issued an article on this problem.

I intend to set a Korean prescriptive grammar of Chinese by reviewing and refining the

"스페인어 능력평가 시험의 구성과 특징 분석: DELE, CELA, SIELE","The purpose of this study is to provide a detailed explanation about the elaborate composition and characteristics of major overseas tests: DELE, CELA, and SIELE. The three tests have a common goal of evaluating Spanish proficiency for non-native spanish speakers, but certain differences exist in the constitution and evaluation methods among each exam. In this study, detailed composition of each test will be explained and evaluation criteria will be examined. The DELE test can be regarded as the test that requires the most preparation for the examinee in all aspects. However, the DELE exam does not require a perfect score to be passed, but rather a certificate is given if one exceeds the specified minimum score. Therefore, in such perspective, one can say that participants have a bit of an advantage in gaining a certificate. Since CELA is provided in Mexico, the nature of the exam requires more understanding of the Mexican culture than the other exams. Due to such locational characteristic, the number of people undertaking CELA is expected to increase in the future considering not only the current and future trade volume between Korea and Mexico but also Mexico’s position as the bridgehead for entry into Latin America. The SIELE test is a single-form assessment, and the difficulty of the questions can be considered lower than that of other tests. SIELE majorly examines Pan-hispanic expressions. Given the advantages of expedited test results and the possibility of partial testing, we expect that more candidates will choose this test in the future.",김선웅,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A97762765
학문 목적 한국어 학습자를 위한 윤리적 글쓰기 교육의 방향,"Bilingual Research 45, 167-188. This article has been written from the recognition of the necessity of writing ethics, which was not dealt with extensively in KAP writing education. Foreign students sometimes, for various reasons, violate writing ethics. The reason why this is a serious issue is because an individual may become accustomed to undesirable and unethical writing habits without being aware of the immorality behind one`s own actions. However, solutions should not be found from simply accusing the learner of one`s dishonest attitude or consciousness, hut solutions should be found from understanding the reality of current Ethical writing` education and from searching for ``the direction that the education of writing ethics`` should take in KAP writing education. In this writing, studies on current writing ethics education has been done through writing materials for KAP learners, and reviewing the writing syllabuses for KAP learners. Moreover, several proposals concerning the direction of ``writing ethics education`` for both foreign and international students are made. Now, the placement of emphasis on the importance of an ``honest and sincere`` writing above the importance of teaching about the writing ``method`` and the required ``content`` is imperative. Therefore, henceforth, the issue of ``ethics`` should be dealt with in greater part in Korean writing and it is essential that a detailed education plan with its accommodation be developed.(Yonsei University)",이윤진 ( Yun Jin Lee ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108113917

To investigate Korean language teachers` sense of efficacy, OSTES(Ohio State Univ. Teacher efficacy scale) is translated and revised to be applied to KM. field. And to decide relevant factors of the Korean language teacher, preliminary survey was made by 20 Korean teachers. There are 164 in-service Korean language teachers included in the formal survey. The average score of Korean language teachers sense of effleacy is 6.44 out of 9 and efficacy in instructional strategy ia higher than efficacy in classroom management or efficacy in student engagement. Research has been conducted on the statistical relationship between factors of Korean teachers and teachers` sense of efficacy, As a result, mare experienced teachers generally show higher efficacy and the number of students teachers teach at the same time meaningfully affects teachers` sense of efficacy. Furthermore, the average salary of the teachers correlates with teachers` sense of efficacy.

This paper discusses Korean consonant system in terms of typological universals of natural languages with the data in UCLA Phonological Segment Inventory Database (19X4) and The World Atlas of Language Structures (2005). Korean manifests the following common facts that are found in natural languages; (i) the size of phonological inventory and consonant inventory of Korean, (ii) the ratio of obstruents-sonorants, (iii) the number of nasals and glides, and (iv) the frequency of stops(including affricates) based on the place of articulation. On the other hand, Korean has a very unique structure of stops. affricates and fricatives in terms of the manner of articulation.

19세기 콜롬비아 사회와 호르헤 이삭스의 『마리아』,"La novela Maria(1867), unica novela de Jorge Isaacs, se considera como la representante de la novela romantica en America Latina. El fondo y la historia estan basados en las reminiscencias literarias europeas y la propia biografia del autor. En la movela destaca la naturaleza armoniosa en convivencia con un orden social jerarquizado y pacifico. Se considera con frecuencia que el paisaje en Maria tiene por objeto representar el estado de animo del protagonista Efrain, como en la tradicion del Romanticismo. Segun muchos criticos, la novela romantica se caracteriza como el producto del siglo ⅩⅠⅩ, cuando Ametica Latina se desliza politicamente hacia la anarquia despues de la independencia.
En Colombia, el periodo de 1862 comprende los anos de formacion de la nueva Republica y se caracterizo por el conflicto y la crisis. Colombia proclama su independencia en 1810 y la consolida en 1819 con la batalla de Bayaca. Despues entra en una serie de guerras civiles entre los liberalistas y los consevadores. Este conflicto entre dos partidos es el germen del problema politico en la Colombia actual, llamado ""Violencia"".
Maria se puede considerar como una novela que trata del tema del amor entre dos joenes en el paraiso perdido y como un prototipo de la novela del Romanticismo sentimental: la historia del amor y la muerte, Sin embargo, Williams agrega que esta novela se publico para sustentar el proyecto idealogico conservador y crear, particularmente, los balores esteticos comparables a los europeas y c los que las classes media y baja del pais se habian acostumbrado, y que al fin habia logrado describir a Colombia como una verdadera Arcadia Heleno-Catolica. El autor trata del problema social como ideologia, etnia, raza y religion que caracteriza a las culturas latinoameticanas, especialmente, colombiana. En America Latina hay una relacion estrecha y directa entre la historia, politica y ficcion, y el amor sentimental de la novela sirve como paradigma para su construccion.",배지완,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A2096324
한국어 말하기 과제의 상호작용적 실제성 연구,"This study aims to examine interactive authenticity of speaking tasks presented in intermediate Korean textbooks, and to suggest ways to enhance the interactive authenticity. As the core principles of the Korean education, communicative language teaching, task-based language teaching, and learner-centered language teaching are emphasized, and it results that material developers have made great effort to include the authentic materials which reflect the real-world situations. However in order to increase the ability of task performance, the experience of classroom task performance should transfer to a real-world situation, thus more attention should be paid to the authentic process of task performance as well as authentic task itself. Therefore, in this study it is termed ``interactive authenticity`` to refer this authentic process of task performance, and it is specified as follow: i) topic development, ii) turn-taking, iii) response utterance, iv) attitude and gesture. Among these, interactive authenticity of intermediate Korean materials is analyzed based on the framework of topic introduction, topic transition, and topic deepening. As a result, all materials analyzed in this study have devices to teach topic development. Especially expressions and devices to present the way to deepen given topic abound, but topic introduction, which helps to start discourse, and topic transfer, which extend discourse moving to other topic within given theme, are shown relatively small percentage. This study also gives actual example of topic development presented in analyzed intermediate Korean materials. Based on this, more effective ways to lead students to develop a seamless interaction.

In order to understand them, we have interviewed the teachers and parents of the 4 year-old class of the school. Their abilities of using Korean are definitely related to their parents` abilities and their desire to educate Korean to them. Moreover, even though the students are only four year-olds, they are superior to use English to Korean. There are some roles of Korean language school. It should be a field to build their identities, to learn and practice Korean, and to experience Korean culture as a mother country. Lastly, it is important for the students and their parents to establish networks of Korean immigrant community in advance before the public education. Unfortunately, there has not been any Korean language education program for Korean-American children. Therefore, there should be efforts to establish appropriate education systems for the children and teachers alike.

구어 담화에서의 한국어 학습자 요청 화행 실현 양상 연구 -전화 메시지 남기기 과제를 중심으로,"There are relatively many researches on request speech acts of the various fields of Korean education, but many of them employed a questionnaire-type discourse completion test for data collection and thus provided no information on how Korean learners actually made request speech acts in a spoken language environment. Although a discourse completion test is useful for examining the patterns and strategies of using polite expressions by many learners according to their social relationships, it is difficult to get an overall picture of how the primary and auxiliary speech acts are performed in request speech acts with such a test. It is also difficult to discuss whether request expressions learned by many learners can be put to immediate use in a spoken language situation with a discourse completion test since it is a writing task in many cases. This study thus set out to examine how request expressions and strategies learned in the classroom were utilized and whether there would be differences in expressions and strategies according to the content of request by analyzing the materials of learners who performed a task of leaving a message by phone in order to supplement the lacking aspects of a discourse completion test suggested in previous discussions.(Dong-A University)",김지혜 ( Ji Hye Kim ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82420255

칠레 전력산업 민영화의 성과와 문제점,"Chile started its reform process of electricity sector in the late 1980s. As one of the countries with the longest and most extensive privatization experience, Chile provides a good case study. This paper analyses a series of problems that have taken place in the sector since the late 1980s: higher prices by oligopolistic market design, frequent black-outs and rationing by administrative decree, and foreigners' control of the industry.
First, the Chilean case shows clearly how difficult it is to design adequately the structure of the post-privatization market, even though the technological conditions of the industry have been changed by the advent of combined-cycle gas turbine(CCGT) generators. The case illustrates the perils of privatizing an industry characterized by natural monopoly segments and substantial informational asymmetries without implementing a full regulatory regime.
Second, one of the main problems resulting from Chile's privatization of the electricity sector is that it allowed the creation of a large vertically-integrated conglomerate that could use its market power to reduce competition in order to raise its profits. Therefore, the efficiency gains are not distributed to consumers.
Third, and ambiguous and weak regulatory framework makes the generation companies depend heavily on much cheaper hydraulic resources which do not provide stable supply of energy. The generation companies failed to provide electrical power adequately in the times of drier season. Therefore, there were large and frequent black-outs in the 1990s.
Finally, Spanish TNC Endesa has a dominant control over the sector and enjoys higher profits. Appropriation of national rent in the strategic sector by foreign companies shows clearly one of the darker sides of post-privatization debacle in Latin America.",이성형,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82638267
문화권간의 비언어적 의사소통에 대한 고찰,"In a world rapidly shrinking into one small community such as ours, the ever-increasing need to establish a firm foundation upon which cross-cultural communication may be effected successfully is only too apparent. Succsesful particpation in intercultural communication requires us to be more than familiar with culture's influence on verbal interaction. It requires us to recognize and have knowledge of the influence culture has on nonverbal interaction as well.
Nonverbal behaviors consist of messages to which people attach meaning, just as verbal behaviors do. Because nonverbal symbols are derived from among such diverse behaviors as body movement, postures, facial expressions, eye movements, physical appearance, the use and organization of space, and the structuralization of time, these behaviors of ten vary from culture to culture. Conseequently, and awareness of the role of nonverbal communication is crucial if we are going to appreciate all aspects of intercultural interaction.
Culture tends to determine the specific nonverbal behaviors that represent of symbolize specific thoughts, feelings, of states of the communicators, Thus what might be a sigh of greeting in on culture could very well be and obscene gesture in another. Or what might be a symbol of affirmation to one culture could be meaningless of even signify negation in another.
A young Korean high school student newly immigrated to the United States was struck by on of his classmates when he was found rubbing his desk with his extended middle finger, unaware of the implied symbolism in American society. Since such a gesture has no meaning in Korea, he was at a loss to understand why he was struck. It wasn't until later that the meaning of the extended middle finger was explained to him by another Korean student. In America the use of this gesture is considered crude and extremely degrading to the individual, since it implies that the individual can only have sexual intercourse with himself of herself.
Misunderstanding of nonverbal communication of and unconscious kind is one of the most vexing, and unnecessary, sources of international friction. Consider, for example, the hands-over-the-head delf-handshake of Khrushchev which he made in response to Americans' receiving him warmly when he came to America in 1959. Americans interpreted it as an arrogant gesture of triumph, as of a victorious prizefighter, whereas Khrushchev seems to have intended it as a friendly gesture of international brotherhood. Would Pearl Harbor have not occurred if americans had been able to read the ""Japanese smile"" of the diplomats as they left their last fateful meeting with Secretary of the State Cordell Hull?
The term nonverbal communication indicates a contrast which spoken or written language. Unlike spoken languages, which, as nearly everybody in the world knows, differ from place to place, there is a common notion that most of the topics included in the nonverbal area are universal, natural, and not learned. Watzlawick and his colleagues have written that while most speech is digitally expressive, nonverbal behavior is analogical. Nonverbal sighs may be far more analogical than speech, but it is quite apparent that nonverbal expressions are not pure analogies for their meanings.
The distinction between the digital and the analogical marks a difference in the contemporary approaches to nonverbal communication. Unlike spoken language, which is based on a comprehensible system(digital), nonverbal communication may of may not be so systematized. Currently, most academic studies of nonverbal behavior assume that, like spoken language, they are learned and not ""natural"", that they conform to some system, and in time will yield something like grammar, syntax, and vocabulary.
As important as verbal language is to a communication event, nonverbal communication is just as important if not more important. Its importance can be seen from communication research, which indicases that as much as 90 percent of the social content of a message is transmitted paralinguistically or nonverbally.
Most studies of nonverbal behavior across cultures seem to have concentrated on the form of and expression-smiling, eye contact, distance-as this varies or is consistent in different societies. Perhaps a better approach would be to start with the values of a culture and then relate a variety of nonverbal forms to those values. Some understanding of the underlying cultural value orientations should help to make diverse forms of nonverbal behavior immediately more comprehensible, and conversely, sensing patterns of nonverbal expressiveness should give us clues to the underlying value orientations.",박명석,1980,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108146380
한국어 어휘 평가의 현황과 전망 -한국어능력시험(TOPIK)을 중심으로-,"Bilingual Research The aim of this study is on issues of Korean vocabulary assessment in terms of its status and prospects focusing on Test of Proficiency in Korean(TOPIK). Above all, previous studies ware considered in order to figure out Bilingual Research whether it is possible to evaluate vocabulary exclusively, and if possible, what is a good method for it. Even though it is practically hard to evaluate the proficiency of vocabulary independently, it is possible, the studies said, because vocabulary could be improved by education and form the basis of other language functions. In addition, it is easily quantified. This study argued that it is necessary to approach the vocabulary assessment qualitatively, not quantitatively, and finalize the selection of advanced level vocabularies. Up to now the evaluation elements of each level has been classified unclearly. Therefore distinct classification for each level is needed, and the way to realize it is to differentiate between expression and understanding. In turns of communication, evaluating pronunciation and spelling of vocabulary is critical, but the evaluation should contain detailed criteria in speaking and writing, rather than independent evaluation. This paper deals with problems with assessment, especially unclear distinction between reading comprehension and vocabulary. For example, when it comes to level of difficulty, vocabularies of answers have a higher level of difficulty than vocabularies of text do.
