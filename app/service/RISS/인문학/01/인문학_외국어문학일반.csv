
인공지능이 인간을 지배할 때,"Nick Bostrom is concerned that the “existential risks” of the modern world are also increasing with technological advances. He particularly emphasizes the dangers of superintelligence. Max Tegmark is also working on threats to artificial intelligence. Their AI discourse depends on the speculative imagination and scenarios of science fiction (SF). The apocalyptic narrative of AI is part of a posthuman culture in which the boundary between scientific fact and fictional imagination has become meaningless. This interaction and intersection between science and fiction can be captured with the terms “science/fiction” and “scientifictive texts.” Expectations, optimism, anxiety, and fear about AI are greatly influenced by the dramatic narratives of popular sci-fi. It is highly likely that real-world AI technologies and scenarios will be misled by interesting stories rather than rational reasoning. Due to these “narrative biases,” the actual scenario for AI is highly dependent on SF and at the same time requires a skeptical view. The technological singularity proposed by SF writer Vernor Vinge has prospered the SF subgenre called singularity SF. Furthermore, the singularity has had a great impact on technology and industry, as well as academics and education, as in the case of Ray Kurzweil. Modern technoscience and myth coexist in this discourse. High-tech companies can also be seen as followers of the singularity. AI and singularity narratives operate within the logic of money and power, as well as technological and cultural contexts. Singularity narratives can leave you indifferent to the real problems of AI, so critical analysis is required.",노대원,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40042539

On this study, the direction of producing Korean language textbook for women immigrants will be proposed in the both of two aspects, construction and content.
In aspect of the construction, above all, it is important that the system of textbook has to correspond with the producing direction. Second, vocabularies and grammars should be presented with proper amount by each grades considering about learner's learning ability. Third, many visual materials should be inserted in a textbook to help women immigrants study alone giving consideration through their studying environment, and the language in a textbook should be exhibited in various languages. Finally, it is needs to produce various textbooks and teacher's manuals to serve using these materials of teachers effectively.
Then, in aspect of the content, first, in addition to language education, Korean cultures which help to women immigrants for understanding the Korean culture practically should be introduced in the textbooks. Second, contexts that are related to real life of the women immigrants should be presented considering about various situation that can be occur to the women immigrants.

After that they could write a well-organized paragraph furthermore it had clear theme. In the statement method education, learning by repetition of the ‘speaking and writing’ could help to find efficient statement way and raised students’ interest in writing. And speaking with teacher while they’re writing a essay, it helps them to examine their message immediately and less the emotional burden to write.
Speaking have a positive effect on writing though, if the speaking process go sour, writing course is negatively affected by it.

Swag Age: Shout, Joseon!, which has recently been receiving a great response from the public, is set in imaginary Joseon, where sijo (時調) is a national ideology. Initially, sijo was a song of the people, but it was taken away by the ruling class, and the people struggle to regain sijo, which is not only their play tool but also a means to express their emotions. The theme that penetrates this narrative structure can be assumed to be “the sincerity of the song” or “jin-gi” (眞機)’, the term of Korean classical literature. The musical creatively ‘recontextualize’ sijo as a literary branch, such as pointing out the ideal enjoyment group for sijo as “the people” or incorporating multiple works into a single work to give it a new meaning. In addition, various contents and formal characteristics of Korean classical poetry were actively utilized in a number of the original songs.
Meanwhile, Swag Age: Shout, Joseon! can also find its significance in that it evoked a positive response from the public by providing content in various ways in line with the rapidly changing media environment. In particular, we can look at the aspect of “modern use” that diversifies the existing enjoyment methods of Korean classical poetry.

결혼이주여성의 시어머니에 대한 한국어 공손표현 양상,"This study is the research on the aspects of a marriage migrant woman's polite expression in Korean towards her mother-in-law. A marriage migrant woman is a special Korean learner. Also, they also get to be placed as a status of a daughter-in-law who serves parents-in-law, together with the position of a Korean's wife and mother. This study looked into the characteristics of the use of their polite strategies in special relations between a mother-in-law and a daughter-in-law through EBS Program monitoring. As a result, first, this study discovered a characteristic that marriage migrant women use the strategy in a bid to minimize conflicts and collisions that might be caused by the difference in language and culture, and to make the relations smooth through the use of strategies putting emphasis on intimacy rather than the use of honorific speech based on hierarchy. As an example, they are found to repetitiously use an informal appellation like 'Mom', or to use a 'Talk-down' style which is commonly used in close relations. The use of a 'Talk-down' style is understood as a strategy of emphasizing a sense of closeness other than they are not taught to use a 'Haeyo'(polite) style and 'Hapsho'(honorific) style. A speaker, who used to use a 'Talk-down' style towards her mother-in-law, shows the appearance of converting her speech to a Haeyo style(polite style) in the utterance for a request. This can be judged as the use of the strategy of upgrading the honorific speech to a hearer in the act that could bring disgrace on the other party. Also, in the utterance like this, they are found to use the words like 'Just', and 'For a moment' that alleviate the burden of the other party. Second, this study found out that there existed a characteristic of using the strategy of an aggressive explanation of a situation in relation to a request or criticism. In case of Koreans, an avoidant type is conspicuous in the speech act of rejection because they tend to hesitate to do a flat rejection, whereas a marriage immigrant woman was found to aggressively use not only the situation explanation strategy but also the strategy of alleviating the loss of face by converting the 'Talk-down' style to a 'Haeyo' style (polite style). Together with this, this study found that they were also aggressively using the respect strategy, such as 'Praising' and 'Greeting'.; however, it's almost rare to find 'Indirect Speech Act' which is mentioned in relation to politeness in a marriage migrant woman's conversation.",방영심,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102496022
나쓰메 소세키(夏目漱石) 『마음』의 주제성에 대한 고찰,"The Kokoro, published in September 1914, is a masterpiece by the master writer of modern literature, Soseki Natsume(1867～1916). This thesis is a study of subjectivity of the work, The Kokoro.
There are two stories inside the work The Kokoro. One is about a teacher who deceives his best friend and takes his girlfriend. The friend later kills himself and the teacher also commits suicide from the guilt. The other is about ""I"" who feels great affection for a teacher away from home and the affection exceeds the one for the father at home.
The teacher calls himself as ""revelation of selfishness"" and his strategy of love which restrains his friend ""K"" is very egoistic, showing that his act is based on egoism.
On the other hand, ""I"" is in a situation to choose between love for his father and affection for the teacher. ""I"" later chooses the latter and this act is considered to be based on liberalism which is very contrary to general morals because his father was dying.
Both egoism and liberalism are based on individualism. When individualism develops self interests, it becomes egoism and when is develops individual character, it becomes liberalism.
In conclusion, thoughts and acts of both the teacher and ""I"" are based on individualism. The Kokoro is a work which calls this being of licentious self by these two characters to account.
Reference, the Japanese word 'kokoro' means 'mind' or 'heart' in English. But based on the subjectivity of this work, the word 'mind' would be more appropriate for the theme of the work.","부백(Poe, Baek)",2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106829277
한국 몽골학의 현재와 미래,"When an organization begins to form, the corresponding people and countries are created accordingly. Our ancestors, who are located in the east of Eurasia, have been protecting and cultivating their language, history, and culture with the national identity of the Korean people for long time. On the other hand, in the northwestern part of the Korean Peninsula and the central part of the Eurasian continent, the Mongols based on nomadic life have established their own culture and interacted with the surrounding people and countries. Geographically adjacent Koreans and Mongolians were inevitably in contact and had to know each other for mutual benefit.
An area studies is the study to know the other person, and Mongolian studies fall into that category. As Korea has long been neighboring and interacting with Mongolia, it has a high understanding of Mongolia, and several uncomfortable relations have raised interest in Mongolia. Specifically, even after 100 years of Mongolian interference at the end of the Goryeo Dynasty, Joseon Dynasty still learned Mongolian in consideration of its relations with Mongolia, and this tradition continued until 1894 when the ministry of foreign was abolished.
The tradition of Korean Mongolian studies, which was cut off for 100 years due to foreign power and ideology, was restored in 1990 when the Republic of Korea established diplomatic ties with Mongolia, and Korean Mongolian studies returned to previous direct research. Korean Mongolian studies, which have missed the time to lay the foundation for modern academic research, have filled the gap through explosive interest and research over the past 30 years, and at the center were the “Korean Association for Mongolian Studies” and a number of research institutes.
Korean Mongolian studies have continued to make efforts to restore the tradition that has been cut off, and have achieved considerable results. However, Korean Mongolian studies are still lacking in many areas, especially in basic research. In order to expand the base of Mongolian studies in Korea, more Mongolian original text should be translated and high-level annotations should also be made.
A long tradition of Korean Mongolian studies and frequent contact with Mongolia, there are Mongolian-related materials in Korea and have been treated as a central research material for Korean Mongolian studies. In recent years, through joint research with Mongolia, we have also been collecting data that we have investigated in Mongolia. However, we should consider the fact that we are not fully utilizing hard-earned data or materials we have.
Mongolian studies are no exception at this time when convergence is a major academic trend. Only joint research in various fields is a shortcut to understanding Mongolia correctly. In addition, joint research with local institutions and scholars in Mongolia is essential, and exchanges and joint research with Mongolian scholars from various countries around the world will also serve as an opportunity to develop Korean Mongolian studies.",이성규,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732099

재난 유토피아와 증언-하기의 윤리 - 2020년대 SF(Science Fiction)에 나타난 ‘기후/생태 재난’을 중심으로 -,"In this paper, recent novels featuring climate and ecological disasters are analyzed and the nature of the ‘disaster utopia’ created in the ruins is considered. In addition, members of the disaster utopia will review ‘testimony-making’ as an ethical attitude toward the ruined climate and ecosystem. In recent novels, climate and ecological disasters are reproduced as both a description of the reality currently underway in countries around the world and a catastrophe for the future to come. And in this world, when human sustainable life is in question due to climate and ecological disasters, a dome city is built to protect only selected people. People in the dome who are guaranteed survival and people outside the dome who are driven to death conspire to protect the dome. However, a small number of people who have experienced disaster utopia outside the dome try to end the hostile coexistence by tearing down the dome that promotes discrimination and disgust. They hope everyone faces this problem with equality in the face of disaster. When the age of disaster arrives, many values used in the previous era change. Among them, what stands out in the novels is the fact that the reciprocity of the gift form is transformed into an exchange method. People who are guaranteed a minimum life through exchange practice actions to end disasters. And disasters are talked about in various ways such as diary, report, lecture, and oral retelling. And later, when someone investigating a disaster appears, this story is completed as the testimony of an era. As such, the disaster testimony in the novels show that humans faced with mass extinction did not give up the possibility of solidarity in the midst of shame, misery and despair, and struggled to fulfill their responsibilities and ethics not only for the present human race but also for future generations.",황지영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107840330

But due to a forced marriage by the emperor, he had to marry Princess Myunghyung against his will, and when Madam Hyung was expelled to her parent’s home, he started to have a troubled relationship with Princess Myunghyun.

ChatGPT를 활용한 AI 시인의 구현(2)-‘AI 이육사’의 생성과 시적 대화의 가능성을 중심으로,"After Alan Turing disproved the premise that ""thinking machines cannot be made,"" artificial intelligence proposed by Dartmouth scholars has made innovative progress despite a number of existential crises(AI Winter). The development of artificial intelligence in various fields, such as life, research, and sports, is largely due to the increase of user data, the improvement of the performance of computing devices, and the proposal of deep learning methodology.
The publication of SIA's ""The Reason for Writing Poetry"" in 2022 was a practical answer to the possibility of AI-created poetry, which was previously considered impossible (or would take a very long time). Of course, SIA's creations were not completely free from criticism of previous AI creations, but it was confirmed that many aspects were improved by the excellent performance of the underlying super-large language model KoGPT and a huge amount of pre-training data of over 12,000 pieces.
From the perspective of ""AI that writes poetry"", which is developed in this way, this paper tries to train conversational AI(Chat GPT). In the case of conversational AI provided by websites such as Bard or Chat GPT, unlike GPT-3 on which SIA is based, or previous models such as GPT-2, and distinguished models such as BERT, pre-trained models are not publicly available, so training by modeling is not possible. However, it has the advantage of being highly accessible and versatile. It is also excellent at reading and maintaining the context of the prompt entered in the same session.
Through the process of attempting to train “AI Yi Yuk-sa” through Chat GPT (GPT-4), this paper explores the possibility of “AI-based poetic dialog” in conversational language models. Furthermore, it suggests the possibility and expected effects of using it in literature/creative education, and setting the direction of sophisticated poetry creation of AI Yi Yuk-sa in the future.",김태형,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102496025
권력의 기원에 대한 탐색과 주체의 불안 - 이청준 소설 「소문의 벽」을 중심으로 -,"This study examines the way of interpellation of power and the response of the subject to it in Lee Chung-joon's The Walls of Rumor(1971). In standard reading, it is pointed out that the bearers of power, such as the flashlight and the interrogator, represent repression in that they force the protagonist, Park Jun, to choose a particular ideology and prevent him from making an honest statement, and the phobia of statements is the result of such repression. But this study first notices that the interpellation of power in the novel does not take place in a simple form that coerces what it wants. It is an obscure call to the subject that is not clear what the Other wants. Faced with this, Park Jun first infers and presents answers that meet the desires of others, but fails repeatedly. This leads to hysterical doubts about the justification and legitimacy of the power that called him. As other characters show, the subject usually tries to build fantasy in the way that ‘the big Other wants this or that’, and to take it as a standard for his actions. Yet in the case of Park Joon, he pushes his doubts to the extreme. He responds to the interpellation of power in a way that reveals the power and its authority ultimately originate in illegal violence and extortion, and exposes the repressed scenes of the “Korean social contract.” As a result, this study demonstrates that Lee Cheong-jun tried to speculate about the empty space of power by revealing that such power begins with an illegal origin in the 1960s.",조소명,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76263287

There were 37 words in ‘correspondence’ which are level one words that are easy to acquire, 13 words in ‘differentiation’ which are level two words and therefore more difficult to acquire than the words in level one, and 9 words in ‘new category’ which are level three words and considered the most difficult in this classification.

미등재어의 사잇소리 현상과 사이시옷 표기에 대하여,"This study aims at revealing whether the argument suggested consistently in Choi (2008, 2018ㄱ) on not employing ‘sai-siot’ in the case of ‘Sino-Korean + Korean native words’ is applicable to non-listed words. To achieve this goal, using the result of a survey by Choi (2018ㄴ), I tried to show the ‘sai-siot’ orthography of non-listed words, the ’sai-siot’ pronunciation of non-listed words according to ‘sai-sori’ phenomena, and the correlation between the two groups. As a result, in spite of the fact that the ratio of ‘sai-siot’ orthography with non-listed words is much lower than that of ‘sai-siot’ orthography with listed words, I discovered that the whole tendency of ‘sai-siot’ orthography in ‘Korean native words + Korean native words’, ‘Korean native words + Sino-Korean’ and ‘Sino-Korean + Korean native words’ is consistent with Choi(2008, 2018ㄱ). It is more notable that the ratio of ‘sai-siot’ orthography with non-listed words is much lower, even though there were no large differences in the ratio of ‘sai-sori’ phenomena between non-listed words and listed words. These results imply that the application of the ‘sai-siot’ regulation in Korean orthography looses its effect. Therefore the improvement plan for the ‘sai-siot’ regulation in Korean orthography by not employing ‘sai-siot’ as the main point should begin from the ‘Sino-Korean + Korean native words’ and gradually be expanded to other environments.",최형용,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76263281
LGBT 소설에 나타난 포스트바디의 상상력과 수행성,"This paper aims to examine the queer sensibility and literary resistance reflected in post-body. Hence, based on Korean LGBT novels, it intends to investigate the way sex and gender are realized by a body of post-body.
In the recent LGBT novels, performance and practice of the queer identity are shown by selection of a body through post-body and its transformation considering one's taste. Here, it is influenced by the development of technology. For instance, a high-tech body of LGBTs, which is integrated with a mechanical body, or a hybrid body by genetic modification are bodies embodying the performative gender identity. The innovative development of technology actualizes a variety of potentials of a human body and the thing these works suggest is a body which can be designed according to individual taste. The extreme transformation and deconstruction of a body go toward desacralization of a human body. In the conceptual definition of post-humanism, a human being or a body is not the center of the global awareness but the thing partial and arbitrary so interpretation of these works is free and unconstrained.
As such, realization of the queer identity found from the recent LGBT novels is demanding a gender concept as the social temporality. It pursues imploding the existing concepts imprinted on a body and overcoming a conflict, discrepancy and social hatred caused by discord between sex and gender through potentials of post-body. That is, it presents the new ethics and a lifestyle by combining a bodily issue with technology in the post-human era.",김윤정,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100140476

First of all, the consonant system of Vietnamese and Korean were compared, and then phonological phenomena of Vietnamese and Korean were also compared. This content was written particularly considering about which part among Korean consonant and phonological phenomena Vietnamese learners may feel more difficult. Then the influence of staying period on acquisition of second language was searched.
Consequently, the result shows that, for the aspect of consonant pronunciation, the most difficult pronunciation for vietnamese learners are alveolus fricative /ㅅ/, /ㅆ/ among all Korean consonants which are tripleopposition in experimental questions. And for the phonological phenomena, the error rate is high in all experimental phonological phenomena, particularly the phonological phenomena with highest error rate was nasalization, and the error rate of double final consonant is higher than that of single final consonant in liaison rule.
And result shows that the proficiency exists as a variable in acquiring pronunciation. It also shows that staying period doesn’t exist as a variable.
I could confirm, through this study, the consonant system between Korean and Vietnamese are so different from each other, and because of it, various errors occurred in pronunciation of consonants and phonological phenomena by Vietnamese learners.
Considering these, this result implies the Vietnamese learners must acquire consonants pronunciation through systemic and visible reference, and they have to pay attention to and study about phonological phenomena from the beginning. And this study suggested that educators must teach phonological phenomena from easier ones to difficult level step by step in teaching Korean.",이혜정,2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106829284
