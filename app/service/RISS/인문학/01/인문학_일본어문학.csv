His works often use motifs from Japanese mythology, Shinto beliefs, and classical performing arts. This movie even the emperor joins them. However, it would be too simplistic a criticism to point out returning to Japan. Are there any ¡°Japanese¡± elements involved in the ¡°global¡± success of the disaster movie trilogy? The points emphasized in the movie poster are the unrivaled drawings and music, the emotional fantasy adventure, and the rapid development and reversal of the drama. Based on these three viewing points, this paper points out the changes in the relationship between the landscape and the inner world, between Tokyo and the countryside, between the gods and humans, and between the community and the individual.

He also argued that shamanistic beliefs in Korea were considered superstition, and even restricted, since Confucianism originated from the other countries¡¯ suppressed folk religions. On the other hand, he discussed the superiority of Shinto based on the fact that it has become a distinct and unique religion by combining foreign and folk religions in Japan.
However, I argue that Shiba Ryotaro¡¯s shamanistic idea is based on Japanese nationalism, as he discriminatingly described the superiority of the combinatory nature in Shinto, ignoring that shamanistic beliefs in Korea had been combined into folk culture, while the shamanistic beliefs were largely suppressed after the Joseon Dynasty.",ÀÌº¹ÀÓ(ì°ÜØìò),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104561483

According to the tariff HS Code, meat, vegetables, fruits, cereals, marine products, and beverages were selected as independent variables. Exports of Japanese food products reached 1 trillion yen per year as of 2022.
Since import restrictions on Fukushima agricultural and fishery products have continued for about ten years, these results differ from general expectations. The increase in exports of agricultural products in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, and ASEAN countries means the leakage did not threaten Japan¡¯s reputation. Furthermore, China was the fastest-growing market for Japan¡¯s food export. Its preference for Japan¡¯s food increased, and Hong Kong has functioned as a gateway.
South Korea showed a different trend compared to other importing countries.

Overseas employment should be approached in terms of cultivating global talent rather than brain drain. In addition, as the production age population (from 15 to 64 years) is on decline, it is imperative to develop a two-way appoach on how to use overseas employment personnel in the future, such as career certification and data conversion of overseas work experience, as well as strengthening support for returnees.","ÀÌÈ¿¼±(Lee, Hyo-Seon)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100312940

Especially, it has examined factors of popularity and various implications focusing on ¡°Attack on Titan¡±, an animated film, which has been sensational in both Korea and Japan since 2013. There are various reasons behind the popularity, above all, the first factor is that the film has a binary plot between men and giants and diverse symbols. However, a variety of interpretations of the work in Korea, which coincided with this popularity, and controversies about the rightwing trend of the writer caused a decline of the popularity. And it was a momentum for people to ask the essential meaning of Japanese cultural content works. Six years later, although the popularity of the film in Korea is less than that of 2013, it is still gaining its own popularity among the big fans.
To sum up, this paper shows that what kind of strengths of Japanese cultural contents are making the controversial work continue to be popular. Also, it proves that the film has various implications with interesting and exciting symbols like giants, cannibalism, and fear etc. Furthermore, it confirms that the potential of Japanese cultural contents in the active use of traditional Japanese cultural archetype.

To date, the number of traditional Japanese arts so registered totals 21, including entertainment, festivals, and traditional techniques, but not Washoku. In 2010, for the first time in the world, food culture was registered as a UNESCO cultural heritage, including the gastronomic meals of the French, traditional Mexican cuisine, and the Mediterranean diet. Following France and Mexico, Korea applied to list its ¡°imperial cuisine¡± as an intangible cultural heritage, and there has been an effort in Japan to register food culture as well. At first, the NPO Japanese Culinary Academy began the process of registering Japanese food culture as a cultural heritage on its own. However, the academy later sought the government¡¯s assistance, which cooperation they did indeed receive. Experts familiar with Japanese food culture gathered and held four meetings to finalize the application. Attendees of this meeting reported that Washoku is not a dish but a complete traditional Japanese food culture. They also described one of the characteristics of Washoku as ¡°respect for nature.¡± Interestingly, the main reason why the name used by the Japanese to apply to UNESCO changed from kaiseki cuisine to Washoku is the failure of Korea to register its imperial cuisine.",±èÇö¿í(ÑÑúçéï),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430572
