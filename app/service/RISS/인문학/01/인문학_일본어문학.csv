His works often use motifs from Japanese mythology, Shinto beliefs, and classical performing arts. This movie even the emperor joins them. However, it would be too simplistic a criticism to point out returning to Japan. Are there any “Japanese” elements involved in the “global” success of the disaster movie trilogy? The points emphasized in the movie poster are the unrivaled drawings and music, the emotional fantasy adventure, and the rapid development and reversal of the drama. Based on these three viewing points, this paper points out the changes in the relationship between the landscape and the inner world, between Tokyo and the countryside, between the gods and humans, and between the community and the individual. This shows that the artist's interest in post-disaster collective memory and new ways of linking it as a problem is clearly different from the so-called “return to Japan” theory.",배관문,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108665739
한국의 무속신앙과 일본신도(神道)에 대한 연구,"In this article, I studied shamanistic beliefs and Shinto, which are folk religions in Korea and Japan, respectively. I approached these beliefs from the perspective of Shiba Ryotaro. In the literatures, he discussed the differences in cognition of folk religions between Koreans and Japanese, focusing on shamanism and foreign religions. He put emphasis on the similarity of the role of the shaman, which is called as “Mudang” and “Mico” in Korea and Japan, respectively, in that behavior and appearance of shamans are similar in both Korea and Japan.
He also argued that shamanistic beliefs in Korea were considered superstition, and even restricted, since Confucianism originated from the other countries’ suppressed folk religions. On the other hand, he discussed the superiority of Shinto based on the fact that it has become a distinct and unique religion by combining foreign and folk religions in Japan.
However, I argue that Shiba Ryotaro’s shamanistic idea is based on Japanese nationalism, as he discriminatingly described the superiority of the combinatory nature in Shinto, ignoring that shamanistic beliefs in Korea had been combined into folk culture, while the shamanistic beliefs were largely suppressed after the Joseon Dynasty.",이복임(李福任),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104561483

신카이 마코토의‘세카이계’ 연구 - 「너의 이름은」 을 중심으로,"This paper aims to examine the ‘Sekaikei (セカイ系) ’ of Makoto Shinkai through Novel “ Your Name ” and light novel “ Your Name ” which are highly supported as a literary work. ‘Sekaikei’ refers to a group of works that are directly related to the bigger zero, such as the crisis of the world and the end of the world, without the so-ciety or the middle term, based on the bilateral relationship between the hero of the so-called story and the romantic partner. It is no exaggeration to say that the works of ‘Sekaikei’ had changed in 2000s. Tsuneko Uno focuses on the issue of ‘communication’ that Hiroki Azuma didn’t pay attention to in the subculture of Japan since 2000s. the ‘romance’ problem, which can be called the central axis of ‘Sekaikei’, is conceived in principle as the possibility of communication with the other. Makoto Shinkai is looking for the core of ‘Sekaikei’ in you and my ‘communication’. Especially, “ Your Name ”, the two main characters communi-cate using direct language. However, even when they can’t contact each oth-er, they can guarantee that they have “intrinsic communication” that they re-member with their bodies and senses even after forgetting each other’s names. Makoto Shinkai can be regarded as having attempted to build a new “Sekai system” that fuses social issues, memories of the group, and individual emotion based on such communication in “ Your Name ”. The light novel “ Your Name ” that was published after being authorized by Makoto Shinkai is introduced with three more episodes that don’t appear in the original novel. Each episode invokes hidden emotions of the main charac-ter, and describes how the extended communications of the two main charac-ter are being received and influenced by each character. The light novel “ Your Name” is a horizontal story while maintaining the story development of the novel “ Your Name ” as it is, it can say a novel that can be accessed crosswise.","양원석(Yang, Eric)",2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105158046
한국산 스마트폰 게임 ‘블루 아카이브’의 일본 ‘게임 성지순례’ 비즈니스 성립을 위한 조건,"This paper will confirm the representation of Japan revealed in the smartphone game ‘Blue Archive’ and its promotions released in February 2021, by research and analysis of related materials. We look at where the producer and distributor set the stage and how fans shared that information. The roles of both two companies will be considered for the revival of ‘pilgrimage’ after the COVID-19 era.
By conducting the study, the following facts were confirmed: First, ‘Blue Archive’ created a visual likely to be seen in Japanese school anime by using background art that you might have seen in major towns in Japan. Yostar, the publisher released an advertisement anime with Akihabara as the background motif after the game was released. And some friendly fans have come up with the local motif based on this.
Yostar may continue to do its best to manage the public opinion of fans in a friendly way from the perspective of a ‘publisher’ and ‘information spreader’.

후쿠시마 원전 사고 이후 일본산 식품에 대한 한국의 인식 변화 -일본산 수산물 수입변화를 중심으로-,"This paper examines whether the earthquake significantly damaged Japan’s image, which has been proud of its safety and security value. In order to investigate this research, the present study analyzed annual data of UN Comtrade’s world trade export from 1990 to 2022.
According to the tariff HS Code, meat, vegetables, fruits, cereals, marine products, and beverages were selected as independent variables. Exports of Japanese food products reached 1 trillion yen per year as of 2022.
Since import restrictions on Fukushima agricultural and fishery products have continued for about ten years, these results differ from general expectations. The increase in exports of agricultural products in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, and ASEAN countries means the leakage did not threaten Japan’s reputation. Furthermore, China was the fastest-growing market for Japan’s food export. Its preference for Japan’s food increased, and Hong Kong has functioned as a gateway.
South Korea showed a different trend compared to other importing countries. Its import of fish from Japan remained the same due to exchange rates effects and lots of restaurants selling Japanese food. However, beverages showed a drastic decrease in anti-consumption movements based on political conflicts from 2018 to 2020.
This study shows that even if a disaster damages the national image of food confidence, the negative influence may be limited in some foreign countries and foreigners in the same direction.",노지현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103451998

In the past, novels were created online on the Internet without a platform for web novels, which are characteristics the two countries have in common. Web novels have research value in the sense that they are attracting much attention from these countries with a huge growth potential. In addition, popular novels were moved from offline to online, which could change existing popular novels. Considering these, we should complexly explore research methods on existing literature and the relevant environment. Based on this thought, we examined the environment of web novels in Korea and Japan, especially focusing on platforms.

Considering this in mind, I examined three channels; voice calls, face to face conversation and KakaoTalk messages. And, as the use of emoticons and stickers expanded along with the expansion of SNS, I also investigated how emoticons influence on communication behavior and messages.
I would like to sum up the main points of the results as follows; firstly, when Positive Face towards the senders is required, there are tendencies of selecting a relatively larger number of message transmissions using KakaoTalk than voice calls. On the other hand, when Negative Face towards the senders is needed, I can confirm that the number of voice calls increased relatively. In addition, I obtained the result that the use of emoticon affects the credibility in the messages.

회화 속에 되살아난 전통: 서양화가 도상봉(1902-1977)의 조선백자 재현을 중심으로,"Joseon white porcelain is one of the representative works of art of Korea. An art historian, Choi Soon-woo(1916-1984) said “The white porcelain of the Joseon Dynasty contains the richest ethnic sentiment.” In this way, Koreans have had found their ethnic identity in white porcelain and they have eagerly collected, appreciated, and reproduced it in various ways. Korean modern painters also have awakened to the “artistic” value of Korean traditional crafts and used them as materials for their paintings. For example, To Sang-bong(1902-1977), the first generation of Western painters of Korea was the representative man who painted the beauty of flowing curves and the milky white color of it.
Based on this situation, this paper examined the rediscovery of the beauty of white porcelain in modern Korea, focusing on the activities and works of To Sang-bong. I discussed the circumstances surrounding the rediscovery of white porcelain in connection with the activities of Muneyoshi Yanagi (1889-1961), which was carried out in both Korea and Japan. In addition, I reconsidered the background of To’s lifelong painting of white porcelain from the perspective of the “Theory of Orient” in Korea in the 1930s and the “Shinnihon Shugi” in the Japanese art world.
Korean Western painters made it their artistic task to express Korea’s unique sense of beauty using the techniques of modern painting that were accepted through Japan. Also, in seeking cultural independence from the West and Japan, they focused on the material of Korean white porcelain. As a Korean artist and a modern Western painter, To Sang-bong discovered white porcelain as a material while wondering what and how he should paint, and he formed his unique art style while painting white porcelain as his lifelong theme.",신민정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106075692

The culture code of primitive religion in “Princess Mononoke” “Spirited Away” appears in three aspects greatly. There are spirit-of-a-departed-person faith, revengeful ghost faith, and primitive Shintoism.
First, it is a spirit-of-a-departed-person faith has appeared as the natural forest in “Princess Mononoke” that has the intense energy as an object of faith.
Sesond, it is a revengeful ghost faith and curse god that is representation by San and Nagonokami in “Princess Mononoke”. However, a revengeful ghost does not simply surface as an object of fear, or is not denoted by “Princess Mononoke” only as an object of extermination. Moreover, no revengeful ghosts attributed only to wrong.
A third interpretation-that primitive Shintoism has appeared as gods"" world and gods of yaoyorozu-is a lanyard and a sanctuary. The scene into which stone small shrine is thrown away freely appears in the portion of the beginning of “Spirited Away”, and the dry old tree by which the lanyard is stretched just after that is drawn on it.
Although there is a role into which a sanctuary and the world are made to divide in this lanyard, since the lanyard is stretched. Moreover, the sanctuary where the world of the gods who are beyond the tunnel of “Spirited Away” was separated from the world.

In Korea, we can confirm Korea also has Otaku through 1995""s comic market. That time, many people don""t know about Otaku but now, people know who they are.
However, compare to its exposure, study about them is short. There are many studies about Japanese Otaku, but not about Korean""s.
Korean Otaku culture has short history but it spreads quickly through online community. So now, we need to consider Otaku""s meaning in Korea.
When Otaku was used in Korea first time, it was used as a expert. However, now it means those who have enthusiasm for japanese culture, especially anime. In Korea, Pye-In, ~Ppa, ~Deok, O-Deok-Hoo have same meaning with Otaku. Pye-In means those who are obsessed by their interest and stay home at all time. Also, they don""t criticize their interest. At this aspects, Pye-In and ~Ppa have something in common. ~Deok, similar with Japanese mania, means those who have more attention for their hobby more than usual people. At last, O-Deok-Hoo is which pronounce Otaku as Korean and has same meaning. However, O-Deok-Hoo has narrower interest than Japanese Otaku.

Especially, it has examined factors of popularity and various implications focusing on “Attack on Titan”, an animated film, which has been sensational in both Korea and Japan since 2013. There are various reasons behind the popularity, above all, the first factor is that the film has a binary plot between men and giants and diverse symbols.

The application preparation process has been recorded in published proceedings and press releases. In Japan, traditional performing arts such as Noh and Kabuki were registered with UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage in 2008. To date, the number of traditional Japanese arts so registered totals 21, including entertainment, festivals, and traditional techniques, but not Washoku. In 2010, for the first time in the world, food culture was registered as a UNESCO cultural heritage, including the gastronomic meals of the French, traditional Mexican cuisine, and the Mediterranean diet. Following France and Mexico, Korea applied to list its “imperial cuisine” as an intangible cultural heritage, and there has been an effort in Japan to register food culture as well. At first, the NPO Japanese Culinary Academy began the process of registering Japanese food culture as a cultural heritage on its own. However, the academy later sought the government’s assistance, which cooperation they did indeed receive. Experts familiar with Japanese food culture gathered and held four meetings to finalize the application. Attendees of this meeting reported that Washoku is not a dish but a complete traditional Japanese food culture. They also described one of the characteristics of Washoku as “respect for nature.” Interestingly, the main reason why the name used by the Japanese to apply to UNESCO changed from kaiseki cuisine to Washoku is the failure of Korea to register its imperial cuisine.",김현욱(金賢旭),2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105430572
