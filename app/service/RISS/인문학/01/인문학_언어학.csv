In order to write generative grammars of the three children's utterances, analysis of distributional characteristics and underlying semantic relations were made. Thereafter, the following five developmental stages of earlier child language were proposed:
Monoreme stage, which has been traditionally called one-word sentence;
Duoreme stage, in which the first-position word of the two-word utterance functions either as a vocative or a deictic interjection:
Two-word sentence-stage, in which either syntactical relation in grammartical level or case-relationship in cognitive level is explicitly implied;
Three or more words sentence stage, a stage of more complex constructions of hierarchical structures in which semantical relation as well as sentence length is more complicated.",조명한,1975,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19562777

여성의 차별적 이미지 재현과 성차별 언어 표현의 양상 : 2014~2019년 영화를 중심으로,"This study discusses the representation of women and the use of discriminatory language expressions regarding them in movies. This study analyzed female characters and the language expressions used in relation to these female characters in the films between 2014 and 2019. Considering features of each character, the following types of discrimination were observed: “treating women as sexual objects” and “subordinating wife to husband” on the subject of right and violence, “treating women as men’s subordinates” for labor and in positions of leaderships, “excluding women” in terms of race and disabilities, “restricting women to gender-specific roles such as housewives” in motherhood and image of women, and “treating women’s behavior or personality differently’ in abilities and occupations. In the result of discriminatory language expressions, “degrading of women” was most frequently observed. And “treating women’s behavior or personality differently” was observed in few movies, exhibiting the lowest frequency. “Treating women as subordinates to men” and “excluding women” were expressions of discrimination in public spheres against social advancement, and “restricting women to gender-specific roles such as housewives” and “subordinating wife to husband” can be considered expressions of patriarchy.","박은하(Park, Eunha)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108600540

We can access to high-speed internet at anytime and anywhere thanks to the advent of smart-phones which are fully equipped with computer and mobile phone. Such being the case, netizens' language use in real-time has increased significantly in the social network services (SNS) such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. So smart-phones and mobile internet have become an important part of our lives, and the time and opportunities of reading and writing in cyberspace are also rising rapidly. The purpose of this paper is to identify the use of net-language in 2012 and look at the recent research trends and challenges of net-language. In section 2, we introduce the usages of net-language in the SNS. In section 3, the recent research trends of net-language adopted in the SNS will be examined. Then, we present the future direction and challenges of research on net-language. Through this process, it has been confirmed that the reading and writing activities in cyberspace have become a part of our everyday life, and the characteristics of net-language are observed to be transferred to everyday language. It appears to be necessary to study the new phenomena of net-language and linguistic cultures which are emerging with the advent of smart-phones and mobile internet. We want to point out the necessity of research on the new emerging and changing of net-language. In addition to that, the effects of net-language on the netizen should be studied and dealt with in a more serious way.",이정복,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107862769

These categories can then be used to classify language signs into four types: ①[+ related, +authorized], ②[+related, -authorized], ③[-related, +authorized], ④[-related, -authorized]. Whereas naturalism permits ① and ②, conventionalism only accepts ③ and ④ Eclecticism embraces all of the above. I add a fourth point of view, which I shall call strong naturalism, that only deals with ① It introduces a one-language-world in which only an individual`s personal language i.e. idiolect is used.

국내 번역학 기계번역 연구 동향:내용 분석과 키워드 분석을 중심으로,"This study is aimed at identifying the current trends in research on machine translation(MT) conducted by Korean translation researchers. Content analysis was undertaken for forty-nine papers published between 1997 and 2018 in the four local translation studies(TS) journals. In addition, a keyword analysis procedure of corpus linguistics was used to compare keywords of MT research in TS and engineering. It was found that the last two years witnessed a dramatic increase in the size of MT research. Overall, TS machine translation research was divided into three categories: high-level summaries of the MT landscape, MT production-centric research and MT consumption-centric research. MT consumption-centric research accounted for the majority of MT research in TS, positioning TS researchers mainly as consumers of MT systems. The most frequent subject of MT research in TS was the assessment of MT products and systems. The keyword analysis revealed that MT research in TS was characterized by its focus on the “guideline” and “training” of “post-editing” whereas MT research in engineering was distinguished by the efforts to “introduce” and “optimize” machine translation “models”.",최문선,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105456667
한국어 줄임말의 사회언어학적 고찰,"Abbreviation is one of the typical examples of using language. Traditionally, abbreviations are classified into the following four major categories in English morphology: (i) initialism, (ii) acronyms, (iii) clipping and (iv) blending. This research examines types of abbreviatory expressions in Korean from a sociolinguistic perspective. This study first provides a brief analysis of types of abbreviations in Korean, mainly in terms of morphology. The examination shows that in Korean the distinction between initialism and acronym does not hold because of the nature of the syllable-based writing system of Korean, and that acronym is the most widely used types of abbreviation. Second, the study discusses linguistic motivations which are at work in the formation of abbreviations mainly in terms of economic motivation and motivation of distinctiveness. Third, this research explores conditions on the use of abbreviations in terms of sharedness of the information about the referent being talked about. It also shows the property of exclusiveness in the sense that members of a certain speech community share the meanings of the abbreviations. In addition, it explores functions of abbreviations in the following terms: maintaining solidarity, excluding outsiders, novelty, temporariness, and so on. Finally, this paper shows that not only a morphological approach but also a sociolinguistic perspective is necessary in order to fully account for the formation and use of abbreviations in language.","김해연(Kim, Haeyeon)",2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19571186

The comprehensive collection of 754 keywords was extracted from 354 academic journals published between 2002 and 2022. As the result of the analysis, the keywords were categorized into six topics: assessment items, assessment for academic purpose, scoring methods, classroom-based assessment, pragmatic competence, and assessments for other purpose. First, the analysis of the vocabulary frequency revealed that top-frequency words included “items”, “abilities”, “writing”, “speaking”. It indicated that research had been primarily focused on item analysis and descriptions of communicative competence, with an emphasis on writing, and speaking. Secondly, analysis of co-occurring words found that “academic purpose” was the most frequent, followed by “domain-items”, “communication-competence” and “reading-items”. The research before 2014 was mainly conducted on the categories of “communicative competence”, “items”, and “culture”, while the research after 2014 has gradually expanded into the categories of “academic purpose”, “scoring”, and “validity”. Lastly, a paradigm shift towards a learner-centered approach led to a focus on alternative assessment methods within the classroom in the research conducted after 2020.

이다 의 문법범주 재검토,"The purpose of this study is to examine the central issue related to the analysis of -ita (copular be), and to review the grammatical category of -ita. Studis of the grammatical category of -ita can be classified into two large groups: those regarding -ita as a verbal element (verb, adjective, copula, etc.) and those treating -ita as an affix (case marker, ending, syntactic affix, etc.). Among these, we try to show that -ita is best treated as an affix (syntactic affix) for the following reasons: the noun phrase syntactically related to -ita is assigned no case; the noun morphologically or phonologically combined with -ita is palatalized; and no adverb can intervene between -ita and the noun (or noun phrase) preceding it. To explain two prominent properties of -ita - namely, that -ita is dependent on its noun morphologically, and that adnominal elements modify 'N+ -ita', I propose that -ita is combined with its noun in the Lexicon. This is because all affixations are essentially morphological, rather than syntactic phenomena.",황화상,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108269959

통신언어 준말의 형성에 대한 음운론ㆍ형태론적 고찰,"Korean net lingo is a kind of variant caused by PC communication, internet and mobile communication devices. It has several properties that general languages don""t have, and one of them is the reducing phenomena. In this paper, I studied the phonology of the phenomena on many words plus a few phrases and clauses.
On the purpose of this I collected and classified the related data, firstly. And I surveyed the differences between these and the general ones. Lastly, the phonological mechanisms which operates on the generation process were researched. The results are as follows:
(1) There are two kinds of junmal(reduced word) in the net lingo. One is based on the spoken language(=spoken junmal), and the other is generated only in net lingo without relation to spoken or written languages(=net junmal).
(2) ‘Net junmal’ is defined as ‘lingustic form made by phonological or morphological reduction of word, phrase, clause or dependent form in the net lingo’.
(3) Net junmal exists only in the written form, but phonetic and phonological principles as well as visual considerations can be reflected in the generation.
(4) Characteristically, one of consonants between onset and coda in source word may remain in the net junmal as an identification mark.
(5) There a few data that could be explained by analogy.
I guess there may be psychological motivation in the generation of net junmal as well as phonetic and phonological ones. We will learn better net lingo through synthetic understanding which can be achieved by interdisciplinary cooperations.

There are few previous studies of productivity and notions of productivity differ from one researcher to the next. In this paper, I argue against previous definitions and propose a new notion of productivity. This paper focuses on four questions; 1) What is productivity? 2) Does productivity work synchronically or diachronically? 3) Is frequency related to productivity? 4) Is regularity related to productivity? With regard to the first question, I prefer to assign productivity to morphological processes, and not affixes. With regard to the second question, I propose that productivity makes sense only in the synchrony; lexicalization is the result of diachronic change. As to frequency, I propose that neither token frequency nor hapax legomena frequency are related to productivity. Finally, this paper proposes that productivity is a continuum determined by the strength to generate new forms, and is intimately related to the notion of regularity.",시정곤,2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108741508

Lesson plans written by non-native teachers clearly outlined corresponding learning steps. Despite such clarity in guidance, grammar explanations were omitted and insufficient, Also, they are providing grammar information designed in a local way to help Vietnamese learners understand. In the case of open classes, since classes were mainly taught in Vietnamese, the learners' exposure to Korean was relatively limited and there is more controlled practice than meaningful practice.

For this purpose, we investigated the current status of employment-related courses and special courses for inter national students and conducted a needs survey among international undergraduate students. Also, employment-related Korean textbooks were analyzed. The results are as follows. First, rather than liberal arts courses being offered to strengthen foreign students' employment competency, we observed that education is focused on short-term special lectures and job preparation. This suggests that there are not enough opportunities for students to learn the various competencies needed for working life after employment. Second, international students were found to have difficulties in regards to respect, including using appropriate expressions of respect, and establishing relationships with colleagues in the workplace.

To this end, pronunciation error patterns were examined and pronunciation error characteristics were described. Through experiments, the following pronunciation error patterns and characteristics were found. In the case of female Vietnamese learners, there was no significant difference in the pronunciation error rate according to the type of nasalization. As a phonological factors, the second consonant affected the pronunciation error rate. In particular, the pronunciation error rate of 'ㄴ' was significantly lower than that of 'ㅁ' in the nasalization. Female learners were also influenced by morphological factors, which were better applied inside words, and showed a pattern of articulating as the layers, such as morpheme boundaries and word boundaries increased. In the case of male Vietnamese learners, the type of nasalization affected the pronunciation error rate. Unlike female learners, male learners were not affected by phonological or morphological factors, so the pronunciation error rate was significantly lower than that of female learners.

The written corpus of printed newspaper articles from the online Naver News Library that archived newspaper articles from 1920 to 1999 and the news article corpus crawled by the online Naver News portal from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2021 were extracted and analyzed. In particular, this paper analyzed the relationship between collates and keywords based on the corpus linguistic research methodology of the news article corpus for the past eighteen years and how they were being used in official records and press documents by corresponding with the 'dialects, vernacular, and regional languages' in socio-linguistic terms of modern Korean. The results are summarized as follows. First, the concept of linguistic norms that a dialects have terms corresponding to the words or standard languages was established after the 1930s. Second, in the library of newspaper articles published in the 20th century, dialects or vernaculars were perceived as negative objects to be removed in preparation for standard language. Third, it can be seen that the positive value judgment on 'vernacular' has increased in the corpus of news articles over the past decade. Fourth, dialects and vernacular, regional language, and standard language were used to be compatible with each other, and it can been seen that dialects were mainly used in academic contexts and vernacular were mainly used in everyday contexts. Fifth, it can be confirmed that the positive perception of standard language has been maintained in the 20th-century newspaper article corpus and the 21st-century news article corpus for the last eighteen years after the recognition of standard language.",안주현,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99558702

Within the positive discourse context, the live chat and comments are observed in order to discover specific organized structures through a conversational analytic approach. The talker’s positive assessment is revealed in three different aspects. When conversational participants put their positive talk forward, they make the consistent use of repetition, the frequent use of nonverbal marks, and the simplified use of words or sentences. It is also observed whether there exists a discrepancy in the assessed subjects. In the case of YouTube characters appearing in video like hosts or customers, favorable or positive talks are presented at the early stage of live chatting and the length of their talk is mainly short and simple with consistently analogous flow to others. On the other hand, when the assessed subject is the content itself, the participants usually tend to post their opinion at length and more subjectively with little regard to the others’ attitude of assessment.

음성상징과 언어기원,"The connection between sound and meaning is essentially arbitrary. There is, however, growing evidence that language contains many elements which are sound-symbolic-that is, non-arbitrary. Sound symbolism plays a considerably larger role in language than scholarship has hitherto recognized. In terms of evolution, the value of a sound-symbolic basis to communication is fairly obvious, in that it allows greater ease of communication. I propose that sound symbolism can be related to language origin on the assumption that human language should be treated as a representational system rather than just a means of communication likes animal communication and that some traces of the so-called protolanguage in the evolutionary stages of language-such as ouch!, hmm, tsk, shh, psst, etc., which are presumed to have been used symbolically as single vocalizations -remaining in degraded forms of modern language can be shown.",권희상,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108621492

Therefore we examine what kind of social discrimination factors high placed and how these are presented in both verbal and nonverbal expressions. With regard to verbal forms, we examine discriminatory expressions in sentences and conversations including vocabularies commonly used in Korean coursebooks. The result prove that of all other forms of social discrimination found in Korean coursebooks, instances of gender role stereotypes occur most frequently. The second most frequently verbal discriminatory expression found referred to gender personality and behavior, while the third most frequently used discriminatory expression referred to physical appearance and body image. Also revealed in the study was a high recurrence of referencing gender role stereotypes in Korean coursebooks for female marriage immigrants as found through comparing two particular coursebooks. Concerning nonverbal forms, we examine discriminatory expressions in main characters and illustrations. In three types of Korean coursebooks, we observe a high recurrence of gender-biases when discussing job positions. For examples, one coursebook referred to restaurant work as suited for women, while describing the position of doctor as male job. Korean coursebooks for immigrants further reveal discrimination in their descriptions of socioeconomic status as determining so-called higher citizenship status. In illustrations, gender-biases of job and gender role stereotypes were presented more frequently in three kinds of Korean coursebooks than in the other kinds.",박은하(Park Eun Ha),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108640264
사회언어학(Sociolinguistics)의 이론과 전개,"Kim, Hyesouk. 2004. Theories and Developments of Sociolinguistics. The Sociolinguistic Journal of Korea, 12(1). The purpose of this article is to understand a current status of sociolinguistics by reviewing previous studies and attempting to see the future of the discipline as linguistics.
As Milroy and Milroy (1990:485) have defined, sociolinguistics is """"the study of language as it is used by real speakers in social and situational contexts of use."""" It has four characteristics. (1)Those who study sociolinguistics are linguists but they have great interests in adding social variables to pure linguistics. Sociolinguists believe that criteria of correct language usage be based upon not only pure grammatical standards but also societal norms in terms of its relevance and general acceptance. (2)The goal of sociolinguistics is to identify a co-variance between language and society and to establish a theory of language performance. (3)Sociolinguistics regards synchronical and diachronical traits as an identical frame. (4)Sociolingustics pays attention to language usage in societal contexts and extends language competence, which is the main subject of pure linguistics, to communicative competence. D. Hymes predicts that the core areas of linguistics is actually sociolinguistics and, thus, the prefix 'socio' will not be necessary. Although we still have that prefix, it is true that sociolingusitics has already had its own identity and is growing rapidly as an independent discipline.
In conclusion, this paper argues that sociolinguistics will receive more attention from linguists and play a key role in linguistics by explaining variation in language more systematically, and by interpreting and eliminating language conflict in everyday life.",김혜숙,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108378258

It will also probe the way women and men are identified in these ads. Based on 112 women’s, and 56 of men’s ad texts, we examine their sentence patterns, persuading strategies, high frequency words, and red flag expressions. Interrogative forms were preferred in women’s ads, probably to reinforce solidarity, while imperative forms were preferred in men’s ads, suggesting men prefer forceful approach. Women’s ads used far more honorific forms revealing typical character of women’s language. In persuading strategies, [explanation of the products] were mainly adopted in women’s ads, while [women’s recognition] was highly valued in men. For frequency words, it was ‘skin’ which was the most frequently used in women’s ads, while it was ‘man’ in men’s ads. In both women’s and men’s, foreign words were alarmingly adopted in red flag expressions. Exaggeration, deception, and provocation were used much more in women’s ads than men’s, probably due to the fact that women’s ads emphasize explanation of the products’ function or effect. In men’s ads, a vulgarism marked the most, which might have been adopted to strengthen the solidarity between men.","이진성(Lee, Jinsung)",2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108621493

초기 아동의 어휘습득 현상에 관하여,"Die Frage, wie Kinder Wo¨rter erwerben und gebrauchen, geho¨rt zu den zentralen Themen der Spracherwerbsforschung Im Zusammenhang mit der Bescha¨ftigung mit dem mentalen Lexikon innerhalb der Psycholinguistik wird auch dem Erwerb des Lexikons zunehmende Beachtung geschenkt. Der Lexikonerwerb wird als eigener und wesentlicher Bereich des Spracherwerbsprozesses hervorgehoben und unter den unterschiedlichen Gesichtspunkten erforscht und diskutiert.
Zur deskriptiven Darstellung des Verlaufs des Lexikonerwerb steht eine Vielzahl neuer, z.T. auch uneinheitlicher empirischer Befunde aus dem amerikanischen Raum zur Verfu¨gung. Dabei geht es zum einen um altersabha¨ngige Beschreibung des Wortschatzumfanges, die Zuwachsgeschwindigkeit und das bzw. die Muster des Entwicklungsverlaufes. Ein plo¨tzlicher sprunghafter Anstieg, der sogenannte vocabulrz spurt, ist eine ha¨ufig beobachtete Mo¨glichkeit des fru¨hen Wortschatzwachstums. Die Komposition des kindlichen Lexikons bietet ebenfalls Anlaβ zu Kontroversen: wa¨hrend bei der noun bias-Hypothese angenommen wird, dass Nomen die dominierende Wortart im fru¨hen Lexikonerwerb darstellen, kann auch eine heterogene Zusammensetzung des kindlichen Vokabulars vorliegen. In diesem Zusammenhang wird untersucht, ob das jeweilige Wachstumsprofil mit einer bestimmten Wortartpra¨ferenz in Verbindung steht.
Obwohl eine fru¨he Nomendominanz auch in anderen Sprachen als im Englischen zuna¨chst besta¨tigt werden konnte, haben sprachvergleichende Untersuchungen der letzten Jahre Zweifel an der Gu¨ltigkeit einer strengen Version der noun bias-Hypothese aufkommen lassen. Eine Diskrepanz zwischen Nomen und Verben im Spracherwerb ko¨nnte sich zum einen als zeitliche Asynchronie in der Erwerbsreihenfolge und zum anderen als quantitative Dominanz einer Wortart niederschlagen. Befunde aus indoeuropa¨ischen Sprachen zeigen, dass Nomen zwar oft zeitlich vor Verben auftauchen (z.B. Bates et al. 1995 fu¨r Englisch, D'Orodico et al. 2001 fu¨r Italienisch, Kauschke 2000 fu¨r Deutsch), damit jedoch nicht die erste Wortart im fru¨hen Lexikon von Kindern sind. So sind insbesondere personal-soziale und relationale Wo¨rter fru¨he und stark vertretende Kategorien des kindlichen Lexikons (Gopnik 1988 fu¨r Englisch, Kauschke 2000 fu¨r Deutsch).
Eine besondere Herausforderung fu¨r die noun bias-Hypothese stellt eine Reihe von empirischen Studien dar, die sich vor allem auf asiatische Sprachen, insbesondere auf Mandarin-Chinesisch und Koreanisch, beziehen. Crosslinguistische Ergebnisse unterstu¨tzen die Beobachtung, dass die Reihenfolge des Auftretens von Nomen und Verben und der Anteil dieser Wortarten am gesamten Vokabular in Abha¨ngigkeit von der Muttersprache variieren kann. Kinder, die Mandarin, Koreanisch oder auch die Mayasprache Tzeltal erwerben, produzieren schon in fru¨hen Phasen der Lexikonentwicklung einen substantiellen Anteil an Verben, die morphologisch markiert werden und als produktive Bestandteile fru¨her Mehrworta¨uβerungen erscheinen (Brown 1998, Choi 1998). In diesen Sprachen wird das Verblexikon simultan zum Nomenlexikon und damit fru¨her als im Englischen aufgebaut (Gopnik & Choi 1995). Der Anteil der Verben am Gesamtlexikon ist dabei mindestens so hoch wie der der Nomen, in Studien zum Mandarin u¨berwogen die Verben sogar (Tardif 1996). Bei koreanischen Kindern fand sich ein Nomenanteil, der dem englischer Kinder vergleichbar ist, jedoch ein ho¨herer Verbanteil als bei den englischen Kindern (Kim et al. 2000). Auch bei Tardif et al. (1997, 1999) produzierten Mandarin sprechende Kinder signifikant weniger Nomen und mehr Verben als englische und italienische Kinder. Die Klasse der Nomen erweist sich in den genannten Studien weder als eine fru¨her erscheinende noch als eine quantitativ u˙berwiegende Wortart des fru¨hkindlichen Lexikons.
Das Ziel dieses Beitrages ist es, Einflu¨sse kognitiver Faktoren einerseits und der zu erwerbenden Einzelsprache andererseits auf den Erstspracherwerb des Kindes abzuwa¨gen. Pra˙zisiert heiβt des: Folgen fru¨he Erwerbsprozesse - wie z.B. die zeitliche Abfolge des Auftretens verschiedener Wortarten im Lexikonerwerb - generellen kognitiven Gegebenheiten oder reflektieren sie von Anfang an spezifische Charakteristika der Muttersprache?
Am Beispiel des Erwerbs der grammatischen Kategorien Nomen und Verb habe ich exemplarisch der Frage nachgegangen, ob die Erwerbsreihenfolge dieser Wortarten eher kognitiv dominiert ist und damit sprachu¨bergreifende Muster zeigt oder aber eher sprachlich determiniert ist und damit je nach Einzelsprache variiert.
Bei koreanischen Kindern fand sich ein Nomenanteil, der dem englischer Kinder vergleichbar ist, jedoch ein ho¨herer Verbanteil als bei den englischen Kindern.
Die Klasse der Nomen erweist sich in den Studien weder als eine fru¨her erscheinende noch als eine quantitativ u¨berwiegende Wortart des fru¨hkindlichen Lexikons.
Befunde aus indoeuropa¨ischen Sprachen zeigten, dass Nomen zwar oft zeitlich vor Verben auftauchen, damit jedoch nicht die erste Wortart im fru¨hen Lexikon von Kindem sind.

Korean pansori Jeokbyeokga is a classical work with high literary value, created based on the contents of Chibidazhan(赤壁大戰, the Great Battle of Red Wall) in Chinese novel Sanguoyanyi(三國演義, Story of Three Kingdoms). Yangzhou pinghua, a kind of Chinese art of Shuochang(說唱, storytelling and singing) also includes Huoshaochibi adapted from Chibidazhan in Sanguoyanyi. By comparing the two works addressing similar subjects, learners can discover the common points and differences between Korean and Chinese literature and develop their understanding of the literature of the two countries.
In chapter II, the basis for comparing Jeokbyeokga and Huoshaochibi was revealed by applying the method of contrast research among the methodology of comparative literature. In addition, before comparing the two works, the development of Korean pansori and Chinese Sulchang, the formation of Jeokbyeokga and Huoshaochibi were discussed in general in order that the basis for comparing the two works can be prepared.
Chapter III analyzed the similarities and differences between the two works in three aspects: the narrative composition, the characters, and the theme. Based on the result of analysis, the contents of education was presented.
In terms of narrative composition, Jeokbyeokga focuses on macroscopic events whereas Huoshaochibi concentrates on microscopic narrative worlds. The characters are also different in that Jeokbyeokga is characterized by ‘caricature of the characters’ and ‘addition of new characters’, while Huoshaochibi is characterized by ‘secularization of the character’ and ‘glorifying of the evil’. With regard to theme, Jeokbyeokga emphasizes people's life and familism, the values of loyalty(忠) and righteousness(義), while Huoshaochibi values comprehensive egalitarianism, embracement and secular utilitarianism.
Chapter IV referred to an educational plan of Jeokbyeokga for Chinese advanced learners of Korean language, based on the result of analysis in Chapter III. The contents of education comprises the performance method of Pansori and Yangju pinghua, the narrative worlds and characters of Jeokbyeokga and the understanding of its theme. The methods of teaching and learning were divided into the following procedures: activation of schema, utilization of audiovisual materials, understanding of Jeokbyeokga through comparing with other works, and writing review.",곽자청 ( Guo Ziqing ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108728543

The original webtoon succeeded in overturning the message of good and punishing evil that appeared in the hell through modern transformation of traditional narratives and delivering a new social criticism message suitable for our times. Moving the focus from individual behavior to the social structural environment, the message was shifted from individual ethics to social structural ethics. However, in the adaptation film <Along with the Gods>, the message is returned to individual ethics. The original webtoon criticizes the aspect in which a device such as familism ideology is used to produce an individual as a ‘sinner’, and the adaptation becomes an example of carrying out what the original criticizes as it is.",송태미,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100264562
한국어 공손성의 언어사회화 관습 연구,"This paper examines language socialization practices regarding politeness in a Korean preschool. In particular, it analyzes linguistic and paralinguistic features of politeness that teachers emphasize in their everyday discourses with children, and examines the ways that children reproduce or reconstruct these features and other linguistic resources in their peer talk. The analysis of teacher-children discourses shows that teachers emphasize pragmatic features of politeness such as polite forms of request, politeness routines, soft voices, high pitch, and rising intonations while not correcting inappropriate and ungrammatical uses of honorifics. Moreover, the analysis of children's peer talk demonstrates that children strategically use various linguistic and paralinguistic features of politeness to address goals of their culture-laden peer worlds such as pursuit of power and authority, alliance formation, or evasion of adult control. These findings are discussed in relations to language socialization research, studies on Korean politeness, and research on peer talk.",안준희(Ahn June hui),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30052963

ACAD is a meta-theoretical framework for understanding and improving local and complex learning situations, which consists of Social Design, Epistemic Design and Set Design.
As a result of the case analysis, in the case of Social Design, interaction was achieved by appropriately utilizing online class tools according to the proportion of students participating both on and offline. As for Set Design, it was confirmed the pattern changed according to the conditions of the classroom environment in conducting hybrid classes. Lastly, in Epistemic Design, Flipped Learning and Mobile-assisted Language Learning (MALL) were applied to help learners understand the contents in situations where online and offline classes were conducted simultaneously.
The class targeted by this study was conducted in a space where a hybrid teaching and learning environment was prepared relatively early from the point of change to a hybrid education environment. Therefore, this study is meaningful in that it actually proposed considerations for the educational environment and teachers and learners for conducting a hybrid Korean class.",한혜민,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3104102
"""세종학당용 초급 한국어 표준교재""개발을 위한 교수요목 설계 방안 연구","This study aims to develop a syllabus of ``Korean Language Textbook for Sejong Hakdang; Beginner level``. which will be distributed and used as a main teaching material in Sejong Hakdangs in overseas. Sejong Hakdang is a brand of Korean educational facility and program for Korean learners found by the National Institute of the Korean Language. Educators and Students at Sejong Hakdangs has demanded textbooks customized according to their curriculum and educational environment, ``Korean Language Textbook for Sejong Hakdang; Beginner level`` is being developed to this needs. This study will demonstrate the principles and process of designing the syllabus that is the framework of ``Korean Language Textbook for Sejong Hakdang; Beginner level``. And the study will also examine and analyse the current state of overseas Sejong Hakdangs focusing on their curriculum and teaching hours so as to apply the their needs to the syllabus design. The syllabus that will be presented in this study consist of 26 units excluding 3 preliminary units. The 26 units are divided into 2 modules, one with 12 units, the other with 14 units. This ``2 modules 26 units`` system is designed to maximize the instructional efficiency considering current curricula of overseas Sejong Hakdangs in the perspective that overseas Sejong Hakdangs has a need of the textbook with smaller teaching units for their limited teaching hour. This study will discuss more characteristics of the syllabus related to the other constructs of the syllabus.",김정숙 ( Chung Sook Kim ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100518344
言語記號의 恣意性,"Nous voudrions expliquer ""l'arbitraire du signe linguistique"", pre´sente´ comme premier principe de la linguistique ge´ne´rale par Ferdinand de Saussure.
Notre point de de´part est de distinguer le niveau de langage(le langage, comme faculte´, activite´, phe´nome｀ne humain global) du niveau de langue(la langue, comme code du syste｀me de communication, que l'homme utilise dans cette activite´ et avec cette faculte´). Le langage est une partie privile´gie´e de la faculte´ se´miologique on ge´ne´ral. De quelques faits prouve´s par l'expe´rience, nous pouvons conclure que l'essence de la faculte´ se´miologique(donc du language) est d'unir arbitrairement un contenant et un contents, qui n'ont aucun rapport ne´cessaire entre eux. Cette faculte´ est commune a｀ toutes les espe｀ces qui peuvent avoir de la connaissance. Aussi la phrase saussurienne ""Le lien unissant le signifiant au signifie´ est radicalement arbitraire"" doit-elle e^tre explique´e sur ce niveau de langage, croyons-nous.
Ensuite, pour expliquer ""l'arbitraire"" sur le niveau de langue, nous portons notre attention sur l'individualite´ absolue, unique, de chaque acte expressif, que Saussure a appele´e parole. Et nous pouvons constater que tous les actes de parole sont irre´vocablement dissemblables au point de vue phone´tique et se´mantique. Mais nous admettons une identite´ entre les deux re´alisations d'un me^me signe linguistique qui ne sont pas identiques. Pourquoi admettonsnous une identite´ entre les deux, malgre´ pas mal de diffe´rences objectives? Pour re´pondrn a｀ cette question cruciale, nous divisons un signe linguistique par le plan de l'expression et le plan du contenu. Et a｀ l'aide de cette division, nous pouvons constater que le signifiant est forme´ par la segmentation qu'il introduit dans la masse de re´alisations phoniques, et le signifie´ est aussi forme´ par la segmentation qu'il introduit dans la masse de re´alisations se´mantiques. Or, ces segmentations ne de´pendent pas du tout des caracte´ristiques propres et inhe´rentes aux re´alisations phoniques et se´mantiques, de plus elles ne sont pas naturelles, ni logiques. Donc elles sont arbitraires, c'est-a｀-dire qu'elles ne se fondent que sur le syste｀me, que les signifiants ou signifie´s d'une langue organisent, et sur les oppositions et relations, qu'ils ont dans leur syste｀me.
Ainsi nous pensons expliquer ""l'arbitraire"" sur le niveau de langue, car ceria veut dire que les signifiants et les signifie´s d'une langue sont forme´s arbitrairement, par la segmentation qu'ils introduisent dans la masse de re´alisations ou dans la re´alite´. Et, nous soulignons que ""l'arbitraire saussurien"" doit e^tre explique´ par cette segmentation ou formation arbitraire du signifiant et du signifie´, bien que l'arbitraire sur le niveau de langage intervienne aussi sur ce niveau de langue.",宋起炯,1985,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108654264
"국어교육에서""구어, 문어""와""구어성, 문어성""의 구분 문제","Korean language art education curriculum in the area of language understanding and expression classify language activity from the perspective of language, ``listening, speaking, reading and writing`` are separated. However, this dichotomous classification scheme is hard to describe various aspects of the language. In Korean language art education, in oral and written language activities of the general perspective of how the current use of the language, as well as not properly reflect the contents of the Korean language arts curriculum and bring chaos in the system. Korean language art education should need rethink about system of method have been doing well for correctly use of language in a actual. Korean language art education`s contents system needs a sight to see as ``orality`` and ``literacy`` which is the different between of mentality. Orality and literacy done collectively not only efficient use of language skills but also today`s rapidly changing electronic media to communicate the point of view can be called acceptable.",지은희 ( Eun Hee Chi ),2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76485080
