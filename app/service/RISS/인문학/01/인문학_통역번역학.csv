This study investigates the features and differences of ChatGPT, a natural language processing (NLP) tool, in comparison to Google Translate’s translation engine, specifically between the Korean and Japanese language pair, with the purpose of exploring means to leverage ChatGPT’s capabilities in the context of interpreter training in said pair. For this purpose, we will first analyze ChatGPT’s translation of idioms and proverbs to identify whether it is capable of paraphrasing polysemous connotations and implications. We will next analyze ChatGPT’s ability to translate unstructured colloquial utterances. Finally, we will analyze whether ChatGPT’s translation output displays translation universals such as simplification and clarification. Based on these analyses, this study will discuss how ChatGPT may be used toward interpreter training.",박미정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732059
챗GPT 출현 이후 기계 번역과 인간 번역 간의 번역 문체 차이 변화 연구,"The present study explores whether new shifts have developed in the stylistic landscape of human vs. machine translation in the wake of ChatGPT’s arrival. For this purpose, it conducts a series of principal component analyses (PCAs) on a normalized frequency dataset comprising 67 morphological and syntactic linguistic features borrowed from Biber’s (1988) research on register variation. The dataset is derived from a corpus of Korean editorials from three Korean newspapers, their human English translations, and English translations generated by four machine translation systems (Papago, Google, DeepL, ChatGPT), including ChatGPT’s self-proofread versions. The analyses indicate that human and machine translation remain distinctly differentiated in terms of style, as demonstrated in previous studies. However, among the machine translation systems, ChatGPT, both in its translations and self-proofread versions, deviates significantly from the others. A closer examination of the linguistic features strongly associated with ChatGPT reveals that this difference can be attributed to the model’s intrinsic preference for a formal, written style. Notably, there are no substantial stylistic divergences between ChatGPT’s translations and its self-proofread versions.",이창수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108761961
챗GPT를 적용한 번역수업 실천 사례 연구: 학부생 번역 과제를 중심으로,"This study aims to produce preliminary translators who can skillfully use ChatGPT in the era of artificial intelligence. In this study, we note that ChatGPT, unlike machine translation, can be used efficiently for large amounts of translation because it can correct errors with less human intervention using continuous prompts. We designed an experiment and analyzed the results to use it for translation education. In the experiment, undergraduate students majoring in translation and interpretation were asked to translate a portion of the novel Kim Ji-young, Born 1982 into Japanese using ChatGPT on two occasions. ChatGPT made frequent errors in the first task, such as not understanding the instructions, reversing previous instructions, and mistranslating cultural elements. In the second task, however, ChatGPT was assigned a role as a condition for writing prompts, informed of the type of text and expected audience, and provided detailed information such as strategies for translation. As a result, the quality of the translations was much higher than in the first task. The students’ survey also showed that ChatGPT still has significant potential, such as expanding the scope of revision through conversation, diversity of information, and ease of operation and storage.",이선화,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108761954

웹툰과 신조어 번역 전략 - 웹툰 ‘여신강림’을 중심으로 -,"Neologisms have been widely used in Korean webtoons in order to appeal to Generation Z readers, as well as to assert the genre's unique identity and provide enjoyment to readers. This study analyzed the translation of Korean neologisms found in “True Beauty,” and whether the translation strategies satisfy the needs of overseas webtoon readers. The analysis found that semantic translation was applied to all four types of Korean neologisms analyzed. In terms of lexical choice, localization was performed by translating neologisms in the Korean source text into plain English words. As a result, the English translations of neologisms are easy for readers to read and understand, but lost the fun, trendy and unique feeling of the source texts. Considering that overseas readers of Korean webtoons enjoy foreignized translations of culture-specific items as reported in previous research, the direct use of a target language's neologisms or even a literal translation could be viable strategies in translating neologisms in webtoons.

드라마 <오징어게임> 속 비속어 번역 양상과 격식성 변화,"Korean cultural contents, collectively referred to as “K-Contents” in Korea, have been drawing growing interest since a Korean drama titled “Squid Game” gained immense popularity across the world after its release by the OTT (over-the-top) media service provider Netflix in September 2021. Subsequently, the violent and sexually suggestive content of “Squid Game” became a subject of controversy. While the degree of acceptance toward its violent and sexually suggestive content differed from country to country, the level of verbal violence and sexual suggestiveness expressed in the characters’ lines also differed by language, which is an important factor to consider in the context of translation. This research paper compares the Korean script of “Squid Game” with its Japanese subtitles with a focus on the use of swearwords, as well as English subtitles to further identify significant differences, and analyzes how formality changes in line with the level of profanity. The outcomes of the comparative analysis indicate that both the Japanese and English translations showed a higher degree of formality than the original Korean script. However, the analysis of the actual translation of swearwords in each language revealed that differences in translation stemmed from the patterns of how such swearwords are used in practice in the culture associated with each language.

The Korean adverbial particle ‘e’ encompasses various usages and meanings. At the beginner level, learners typically acquire its usage in relation to places, times, and other contexts. Its Uzbek counterpart ‘-da’ offers a relatively clear parallel form. However, at the intermediate and advanced levels, as various examples not covered at the beginner level emerge, learners often make substitution errors and encounter challenges in understanding ‘e’ beyond its roles as locative and temporal markers. The analysis results reveal that instances where ‘e’ corresponds to Uzbek ‘-da’ are predominantly observed in the context of location and time, with diverse usages and equivalents becoming evident at the advanced level. Notably, the most frequent correspondence is identified between ‘e’ and Uzbek’s ‘-ga’.

중한 정치 뉴스 텍스트에서의 은유 번역 연구,"The purpose of this study is to examine strategies in Chinese to Korean metaphor translation, centered on conceptual metaphors in political literature. This seeks to determine whether the translation helps readers to reach optimal relevance. 362 metaphors were collected from political news articles published by Xinhuanet.com and People's Daily Online between January and May 2023 with the use of the MIP metaphor recognition algorithm. Based on these collected metaphors, this study conducts a quantitative analysis of the different types of metaphors and metaphor translation techniques, as well as a relevance theory-based evaluation on the efficiency of these techniques. The findings of the study are outlined as follows: Six translation techniques, including ""retaining metaphor"", ""explaining metaphor,"" ""retaining metaphor + explanation,"" ""substituting metaphor,"" ""omitting metaphor,"" and ""adding metaphor,"" are employed when translating metaphors in political news in China and South Korea. This study examines the efficiency of metaphor translation techniques based on relevance theory and concludes that ""maintenance"" is the best metaphor translation technique to attain the optimal level of relevance when the original readers and the target readers have similar backgrounds and cultural experiences.
The perfect equivalence between the original readers and the target readers is challenging to attain from the context effect standpoint, making it impossible for ""metaphorical interpretation"" to achieve optimal relevance. Translation tactic for domestication texts include the two translation techniques of ""replacement"" and ""addition."" This procedure, while efficient, also allows the target readers to quickly understand meaning and visual representation in metaphor. ""Omission"" drops the original metaphor, which may overlook or alter the meaning, image and information contained in metaphor, hence, we should pay more attention to it.",CAI QIUYAN,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108220921

Interpreting and Translation Studies 13-2, pp. 29-44 The translation of idioms often invites headaches in the process of translation, as idioms possess non-literalness and culture-specific elements in nature. Nevertheless, there are a number of translation strategies that can be employed to transfer such linguistic devices. In this paper, five specific translation strategies, which enable the translator to seek equivalence, are presented. The focus of the discussion will be on how such strategies can be deployed and what attentions should be paid in the process of translating. It is worth noting that each strategy exhibits its unique features and has both strengths and weaknesses when applied. The translations that serve as the bases for the explanation of translation strategies are taken from literatures that contain a number of idioms, thereby requiring the translator to employ active and diverse translation strategies.

After the translation, errors found in each article were systematically compiled and categorized by type, including message, language and grammar, structure. The analysis showed a significant frequency of errors, especially in legal terminology and punctuation usage. Although the study is limited by insufficient data for thorough analysis constructing an extensive corpus of legal texts and scrutinizing their characteristics for a highly specialized machine translation in the legal domain would result in a more apparent domain-specific effect. The changing landscape of the legal market, resulting from factors like legal market liberalization, emphasizes the need for specialized machine translation within the legal domain to keep up with significant demand for legal translation.

"번역과 전문용어학, 전문용어학과 번역학","While “terms” refer to technical terms which are defined within a discipline or specialized field, “terminology” is the study of terms and their use. The foci of terminology are to document how terms come into existence and their interrelationships within a culture, to analyze words being used in specific contexts, and to promote their correct usage. Although terminology can be limited to one language, multilingual terminology, including bilingual terminology, is an invaluable discipline which can help enhance the quality of translation by enabling the translator to use appropriate terms to befit the context, target readership, and subject domain of the text to be reformulated in the target language. This paper aims to establish two needs: first, an application-oriented need to exploit bilingual term databases in the process of translating in order to facilitate the translator's translation work, and a more theory-focused need to make the most of terminology in translation studies as an interdiscipline where standardization of terminology is urgent in order to promote more effective discipline-internal communications amongst scholars with different theoretical and conceptual backgrounds. Thus, the first part of this paper briefly discusses the theoretical background underlying different approaches to terminology. Secondly, different forms of electronic term storage and dissemination systems are introduced, followed by a case report of a Swiss-headquartered multinational term database company.

The result of research has shown thattranslators of the “Major Speech Collection” complied with sentenceboundaries and markers of ST as far as possible, but minimized theirsegmentations when inevitable. Since the structure of Chinese complexsentences is longer and different from that of Korean, sentencesegmentation was more generally utilized in Chinese-Korean translation. In Chinese, sentences were segmented where the meaning of a sentencewas altered, such as topics, comments and relations rather than tangiblemarkers. In Korean, however, it was confirmed that sentences weresegmented at connective endings or adnominal endings. These featurescan be used as references for other translators or future translators. Nonetheless, in terms of the use of connective markers in betweensegmented sentences, readability is somewhat lessened as a result offollowing the ST, therefore supplementation of connective markers isrequired after altering boundaries.

추리소설에서의 인식양태 번역분석: 에드거 앨런 포의 모르그 가의 살인 을 중심으로,"This study analyzes the translation method of epistemic modality in the translation of detective stories, focusing on four Korean translations of Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, ‘The Murders in the Rue Morgue.’ In order to examine the translation method of epistemic modality, first, the concept of modality and the system of modality were explored, second, English modal operators and Korean modal operators were categorized, and then translations ons of modal expressions were compared and analyzed. This story has been described as the first work to see Poe's writing style and form shift from Gothic novels to modern detective stories, or ratiocinative stories in a Poe’s preferred nomenclature. These detective stories are distinguished from other works in that they solve mysteries by reasoning. The ground of reasoning is propositions, and the factuality of propositions can be manifested by modality that generally refers to a speaker’s opinion about the truth of a proposition expressed by a sentence. Particularly, epistemic modality which expresses the judgment of the degree of truth of the proposition, such as speculation, conviction, and possibility, can influence the reasoning process, suggesting the wrong or right directions towards solving the mysteries in detective stories. Epistemic modality is an effective way to bring suspense and curiosity in detective stories by hiding and revealing clues. Consequently, realization of epistemic modality has a critical role in detective stories, in turn;the translation of epistemic modality is one of the important factors in translated detective stories, to influence the reasoning process and bring suspense and curiosity to the readers. Epistemic modality may be a general concept but its realization is language specific. It is realized by using various epistemic modal operators including auxiliary verbs, adjectives, adverbs, nouns, combined expressions, and orders of lexical components. The degree of commitment to the truth of a proposition, represented by modal expressions, may not be exactly the same in the source language and the target language. Given that the translation of epistemic modality is one of the important factors that influence the reasoning process and bring suspense and curiosity to stories, recognition of epistemic modality systems and their different realization in the source and target languages is essential, particularly for translating detective stories.",이경희,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108399983

Against this backdrop, significant attention has recently been directed toward machine translation post-editing (MTPE), where a text pre-translated by an MT engine is post-edited by a human translator to meet client needs. In this study, a text translated from English to Korean via MT was post-edited, and the post-edited output was analyzed to identify any errors that were not properly corrected. The accuracy of the post-editing process was then quantitatively analyzed against HT of the same text. The HT group was found to spend approximately 1.5 times more time on average compared to the MTPE group. The post-editing accuracy, i.e., the ratio of corrected errors to the total number of errors, tended to increase as more time was spent on the task. The average post-editing accuracy of the MTPE group was 39.6%, significantly lower than the translation accuracy of the HT group at 73.6%.

목표지향적 번역이론과 ‘용인성’,"“Acceptability”, related to its opposite “adequacy”, is a concept that is first defined in translation studies by Gideon Toury. In this field of research, adequacy can be connected with literal translation whereas acceptability may be related to free translation. We can therefore consider this concept as one of two binary concepts of translation studies, along with 'formal vs dynamic equivalence (Eugene Nida)', ‘documentary vs instrumental translation (Christiane Nord)’, etc. The researchers mentioned above, as well as the Paris School (ESIT), are known to develop target-oriented theories in Translation Studies. How, then, can their theories be connected with “acceptability”? This study tries to reconsider these three theories around this concept. On one hand, Nida's comprehension of acceptability seems to have been defined by “dynamic equivalence” as the identical response from readers of TT and ST. On the other hand, Skopos theory emphasizes acceptability for the translator. Finally, the ESIT considers this concept in the boundary of TT and ST.

The analysis of the English translations of Korean statutes consisting of 41 dual subject clauses reveals some similarities between human translation and machine translation. In human translations, either N1 or N2 of the source text served as the subject and N1 was often omitted in the English translation, whereas in machine translations, either N1 or N2 of the source text was translated into the subject and N1 was often omitted when N2 served as the subject in the English translation. However, machine translations differed from human translations in that machine translations unduly omitted N1 or N2 and the syntactic structure of machine translations was not as diverse as that of human translations. This study also suggests that machine translations produced by the two distinct engines were similar in terms of the usage of N1 and N2 in the English translation.

한태 문법용어 번역의 문제점,"It is very important to maintain unity and consistency of grammatical terms in teaching the Korean language in Thailand. In this study, the errors arising from the interlinear translation work of Korean grammatical terms, which is being conducted by the National Institute of the Korean Language, are analyzed and corrected, and with regard to the inadequate analysis, more appropriate interlinear translation terms were presented.In the terms related to the sound system, the interlinear translation terms and explanations for the ordinary sound and the tense sound, the vowel harmony and the consonant harmony were revised and supplemented. With regard to the vocabulary system, uninfected words and nouns, predicates and verbs, adnominal phrases and adjectives were distinguished and appropriate interlinear translation terms for each were found so that the unity and the consistency can be maintained. And for affixes and postpositions and ending, the interlinear translation terms that are easy for Thai students to understand were presented, and the list of the Korean terms for the parts of speech, postpositions, and endings and the Thai interlinear translation terms was presented. Finally, in the terms related to syntax, the accuracy and the intelligibility of the translations of the case and the mood and the style of writing related to the honorific mood were enhanced through conducting necessary correction and supervision.It is very important in teaching the Korean language in foreign language to explain the grammatical terms with the native language of the learners. It is because this not only enhances efficiency in studying the Korean language as a foreign language but also enables the learners to understand and approach more easily the language system of the Korean language that they are to learn.",정환승,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107894675
"한국 통번역 교육의 과거, 현재와 미래 - GSIT를 통해 본 한국 통번역교육의 발전사","Korea’s T & I education began when Graduate School of Interpreting and Translation(GSIT) was established in 1979 at Hankuk University Foreign Studies(HUFS). GSIT has been developing through 3 stages of T&I education (initiation, transition and evolution). In the initiation period, GSIT mixed foreign language education with that of T & I, during which the faculty recognized that the two fields are quite different from each other. GSIT introduced and implemented the European model of T & I curriculum, but witnessed certain limits due to the lack of teaching materials, expert faculty, training facilities, etc. In the transition period, expert professors took up the education, back home after studying T & I or linguistics in Europe and other regions abroad. They took the process-oriented approach which was apt for the first stage of T & I education, focusing on the curriculum itself, rather than on the final T & I products. In the final and evolution period, GSIT’s education encouraged the critical thinking of the students, listened to their various viewpoints and let them set up their own conceptual framework. During the same period, T & I research became active, publishing a total of 1,011 papers in 3 top Korean T & I journals until the first half of 2014. At the same time, demand and supply in the T & I market also underwent a lot of changes. T & I curriculum has been sensitive to the market changes and it is now divided into translation major and interpreting major. Korea’s T & I experts should carefully consider the desirable direction of T & I education, curriculum, market and research activities from now on.",김진아,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106303116

From an abductive perspective, this paper organizes data according to Hall’s classification: gestures, facial expressions, and silence as nonverbal communication elements and time and space as nonverbal communication bases. These are not extra-messages created during the communication process, but the messages themselves.
This study also discusses some cross-cultural differences in the body expression elements ranging from the head to legs. Facial expressions were disserted with smiling and eye contact. Silence was disserted in the categories of positive/negative. Time was disserted in the category of modern/premodern. Spaces were disserted by dividing in spacial sensibility itself and spacial sensibility with men, seating space.

유튜브 댓글 토픽모델링 분석을 통한 봉준호의 통역사 샤론 최(Sharon Choi)에 대한 수용자의 인식 연구,"As Director Bong Joon Ho’s film “Parasite” made history at the Academy Awards, becoming the first non-English language film to claim four oscars, his interpreter Sharon Choi also came into spotlight. This study aims to see how the public perceives interpreters on social media through the case of Sharon Choi by sampling the video-sharing website Youtube(www.youtube.com). A dataset of 4,192 comments was collected from the top 10 most viewed youtube videos on ‘Bong Joon Ho’s acceptance speech’ using Selenium, a Python library.
Keyword analysis, association analysis and LDA topic modeling were conducted on the dataset to derive insights on users’ perception of the interpreter. The results show that the most frequently mentioned keyword in the comments was “tongyeok” meaning both “interpretation” and “interpreter” in Korean. The analysis of keywords associated with the word “interpretation” revealed that the interpreter’s delivery skills, expressive skills, understanding ability, and quick wits were the main reasons for the positive response towards the interpreter from the viewers. The four main topics derived from the comments were “Bong’s human qualities and acceptance speech”, “interpreter’s appearance and language ability”, “interpreter’s interpretation skills”, and “general comments about Bong’s award-winning and interpretation”.",권상미,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40063477
한국 영화 영어 더빙본의 평가어 분석,"The film dialogue helps guide the response of the spectator. Often dialogue is a tool for controlling viewers’ evaluation and emotion. And appraisal theory is the most fully developed model of evaluation. Thus it can show how viewers understand and evaluate specific situations or characters in films. This study aims to put forward the quantitative and qualitative shift of appraisal between Korean films and their dubbed versions. The findings show English-dubbed Korean films have far more appraisals than original Korean films do. The study presents three classifications where the use of appraisal comes into play: appraisals in the target text replace culture-specific items in the source text; appraisals evaluate situations in film; or appraisals evaluate film characters. By using appraisal much more in the target text, dubbed versions provide the target audience with a more explicit understanding of source culture, film plot and characters.",윤미선,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107881339

The data for this paper was collected through the Korea Citation Index (KCI) website (www.kci.go.kr), and the data collection period was from 2014 to 2022. For the data search, we targeted five representative journals each on interpreting and translation and cinematography, and a total of 17 keywords were used as search terms. After analyzing the collected articles by year, research topic, language, language orientation, and theme, we found that two main characteristics are emerging in the field of audiovisual translation research: first, research topics have become more refined and specific, and new areas of interest are emerging within them. The second is that approaches to research have diversified. This is likely due to advances in video technology, the emergence of new media, and the changing perceptions of translation studies in society at large. The emergence of new video technologies and media will further increase the need for in-depth research on audiovisual translation, and it will be important to determine the appropriateness of audiovisual translation in different languages and cultures.

AI시대 인간번역과 기계(NMT)번역의 공존 - 경영학 ‘확장(Augmentation)전략’ 중심,"Human translators are deeply worried that they might be replaced by machines capable of translating and interpreting through deep learning and big data analysis. This paper takes a complementary mindset rather than either-or mindset to shift translation’s relationships with machines from automation to augmentation. The objective of this study is to set out specific areas of works where humans can coexist with intelligent machines, turning this challenge into an opportunity to expand the scope of translation rather than diminishing it. This paper adopts a model from the business administration field as a framework. It is “five-paths toward employability” (Davenport & Kirby, 2015) based on “augmentation strategy” and “complementarity” (Autor, 2014). Based on the characteristics of translation in this changing world, I could derive employable areas for human translators in the age of AI: human translators can ‘step up’ as managers establishing a platform, overseeing the whole translation process, building corpus database and coordinating collaboration among participants; ‘step aside’ as communicators catering to the linguistic and cultural needs of each party; ‘step in’ as revisers conducting pre-editing or post-editing for translations done by machines; ‘step narrowly’ as translators doing works only humans can do like literary translation; ‘step forward’ as innovators or entrepreneurs creating new areas of business such as combining language service with voice recognition, applying augmented reality technology into translation.",김순미,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106303120
고전 영화의 영한 자막 번역 고찰,"The purpose of this study is to examine the difference in subtitle translation according to the time the movie was screened and the delivery platform. To this end, the study compared Netflix's subtitles and the DVD version of the movie “Pride and Prejudice” to see if there were any differences in the translations and discussed their implications. Specifically, the analysis was carried out according to two main criteria, focusing on scenes that depicted the themes and characteristics of classical works. The first criterion was the economical efficiency and readability of subtitles, which are the most representative characteristics of subtitle translation. The second criterion was fidelity to the original text. The findings showed that DVD subtitles were faithfully translated while retaining the format and tone of the original. On the other hand, the Netflix translation used concise, short sentences and figurative expressions using a modern tone compared to the original text. This may be attributable to the difference in the age group of the main viewers of DVD and Netflix, and in particular, the difference of more than 10 years in time. It is important to improve readability with a simple and modern tone and to satisfy the needs of the audience depending on the screening platform, but caution is required in using the translation strategy as it may otherwise undermine the characteristics of classic films.",배유진,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76497925

The current research is based on both automatic and human evaluations of Otran’s English translations of Korean statutes and Korean titles of invention and abstracts extracted from patent gazettes. In automatic evaluation, both BLEU and METEOR scores revealed that legal translation outperformed patent translation. Human evaluation results confirmed the automatic evaluation results, showing Otran’s legal translation receiving better evaluation than its patent translation. According to the error comments provided by evaluators, terminology and other errors, mostly stylistic issues, were the most prevalent error types in the legal translation, while terminology and syntax errors were the most frequent in the patent translation. In the legal translation, accuracy and fluency errors were far scarcer than in the patent translation. The results suggest that the domain-specific NMT engine needs improvement in handling terminology in both legal and patent translation, and its legal translation output proved to be good enough for gisting. The findings from this case study cannot be generalized and thus call for further research.",이지은,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107881341

The majority of previous studies, however, largely focused on the impact of machine translation (MT) on L2 writing. Building upon the theories and practices of pedagogical application of MT, and by adopting the concept of translanguaging that legitimises learners’ deployment of full linguistic repertoire including L1, this study explores Korean EFL learners’ perceptions of MT and frequent errors in English-into-Korean post-editing. According to the results of a survey and students’ self-reports of their experience with MT, the use of MT in EFL learning was perceived by the learners as an innovative and positive learning experience. The learners highly appreciated the use of MT in their reading practice and post-editing by pointing out that the use of MT reduces stress and increases motivation to learn English. This study also reveals that post-editing practice can help learners understand deficiencies in free online MT output and raise their awareness of the linguistic structure and subtleties of language.",박혜선,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107939765
<해와 달이 된 오누이>에 나타난 호랑이상,"<A Brother and a Sister who become the sun and the moon>(after this, A Brother and a Sister) is representative national tale which is transmitting in all the area of Korea. Its other titles are <A Brother and a Sister who go up to the Sky>, <Hae-Suk, Dal-Soon, and Byoul-Ok>, <Sun and Moon>, <The Origin of the Sun and the Moon>, and <The Origin why Indian Millet is Red>. It has only a little changes less than other folktales.
This writing overlooks a type of tiger in <A Brother and a Sister>, and then compares it with its adapted ""jeonraedongwha""(fairy tale is transmitted from past ; korean original fairy tale).
Folktales express tiger which is cruel, crafty, stupid and humorous. It also has various characters which is transformable or image of sexual exploiter. But almost ""jeonraedongwha"", which is conscious of children, decrease cruelty, stupidity, and humor. Especially image of sexual exploiter is eliminated and isn't transmitted.
Such a transfiguration derives from changing process from oral literature to written literature. And it begins from indigenous characteristic of ""jeonraedongwha"" which is different from folktales. Primarily oral statement focused story line. As changing from oral literature to written literature, it is under the influence of modern literature which is taking a serious view of realistic description on character and background, and rational causality of event. Therefore ""jeonraedongwha"" writers eliminate or reduce detailed description of cruel scene, because modern reader extremely read it more than before; specially for children.
""Jeonraedongwha"" is not genre which has same condition of existence and literary trait, but modern genre which is reconstructed in modern view on the child and literary outlook. Therefore we should newly set up its Phase.",염희경,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82508790
『구렁덩덩신선비』와 외국 뱀신랑설화의 서사구조과 상징성에 대한 비교문학적 고찰,"The tales of the snake or serpent husband can be found in a good many countries throughout the world. They can be generally classified as Aarne-Thompson folkta1e type 425 (Search for a lost husband). To date, the 35 different versions of the tale of the snake husband have been nationwide collected in Korea. Some of those tales have been retold and adapted by a number of children's literature writers and studied by such Korean literature scholars as Seo Dae-sok and Shin Haejin. However, there does not seem to have been any significant comparative study of the Korean folktales of the snake husband and their foreign counterparts except for Seo Dae-sok's comparison between Roman myth and Korean folktale, that is, Apuleius's myth ""Cupid and Psyche"" and ""Gur ngd ngd ng Sins nbi"" (The Fairy-scholar Serpent).
The present essay is an attempt to locate the Korean tales of the snake husband in the context of world literature by comparing ""Gur ngd ngd ng Sins nbi"" with the foreign tales translated into English or Frenrh. In so doing, I have focused on the narrative patterns and symbolism between the tales of the snake husband in Korea and other countries, especially the Korean tale ""Gur ngd ngd ng Sins nbi"" with a French folktale titled ""The Serpent and the Grape-Grower's Daughter.""
The main part of the present essay consists of the three chapters: first, a comparative study of the narrative structure between ""Gur ngd ngd ng Sins nbi"" and the 19 foreign tales of the snake (or animal) husband; second, a detailed comparative study of the narrative patterns and motifs between the two texts, ""Gur ngd ngd ng Sins nbi"" and ""The Serpent and the Grape-Grower's Daughter; last, a depth psychological approach to the symbolism of the snake and such motifs of skin shedding, burning of the animal skin, the heroine's search for her husband, and redemption.
The results of my comparative study of the tales of the snake husband in Korea and other countries, especially of ""Gur ngd ngd ng sins nbi"" and ""The Serpent and the Grape-Grower's Daughter,"" show that there are many common narrative patterns and motifs between the Korean tales of the snake husband and their foreign counterparts: the third daughter as the snake's bride, the importance of the father to the marriage, the shedding of the animal skin, the older sisters' jealousy towards the newly weds, the destructive burning of the animal skin, the disappearance of the husband, trials and tribulations of the heroine, her competition with another woman for winning the husband, and a joyful ending with the reunion of the couple.
When taking into consideration these common narrative patterns, motifs, and symbolism, the Jungian arguments seem to be very persuasive that ""Fairy tales are the purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes"" and that ""in fairy tales there is much less specific cultural material and therefore they mirror the basic patterns of the psyche more clearly"" (The Interpretation of Fairy Tales 1, 15). Following the views of such Jungian analysts as Rhi Bu-yong and Marie-Louis von Franz, the human wife's search for the snake (or animal) husband can be interpreted as a woman's process of individuation, that is, the synthesis of consciousness and unconscious elements. The heroine, the snake's wife, can be conceived of as a model for a ""functioning of the ego in harmony with the totality of the psyche,"" to borrow Franz's terms; the serpent husband as an archetypal image of the animus, the inner masculine side of a woman; the search for the husband as the process of individuation; and the reunion of the couple as a synthesis of the feminine and masculine elements in a woman's psyche (Redemption motifs 20).
In conclusion, the basic narrative patterns and motifs which the tales of the snake husband in Korea and other countries have in common can be said to show the woman's aspiration towards the totality of the self by turning her destructive animus into an ""invaluable inner companion who endows her with masculine qualities of initiative, courage, objectivity, and spiritual wisdom"" (Franz, ""The Process of Individuation"" 206).",김환희,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A87021842
"베누티의 이국화와 자국화, 그 적용을 위한 고찰","Korean researchers frequently applyVenuti’s concepts in analyzing translation practice. This paper poses three aspects which need to be considered during the application of those concepts. First, domestication and foreignization are not either-or alternatives. For Venuti, domestication is translation reality rather than a translator’s choice. Second, the two concepts cannot be regarded as linguistic strategies. Intentions and effects are more essential than linguistic intervention itself. Third, it is necessary to consider contexts of Korean translation history and market. Applying theory toseverely different socio-cultural contexts could result in inaccurate analysis and inappropriate domestication.

『피터 팬』에 나타난 네버랜드의 공간적 위상,"Since James Barrie`s Peter Pan(1911) appeared, its hero, Peter Pan has been an object of love and desire to the people around the world. For children, Peter is a child never grows up; but rather, remains innocent, with a pure heart and always plays. For adults, he evokes childhood anxiety. However, Peter is an ambivalent character. He has not only a youthful and innocent image, but also a child/ he has adult qualities who seeks for power, despotism and control. Leaving home, he wants to be an eternal child. And he lives in the Neverland as a child, where he is portrayed as a boy/adult. Far from being innocent and peaceful, ironically the place is full of brutality, unmerciful retribution to enemies and despotic rules. After several years Peter returns home. But his mother has already forgotten him. His parents installed iron bars in his nursery so he is not able to return to his mother. Leaving home crying, Peter never returns home and to his mother. And he has an ambivalent emotion to his mother-longing for mothering and rejection of mothering. As a result of that Peter becomes a boy, who cannot recognize women`s emotion and love. Consequently, the figure of Peter Pan is the particular product of Barrie`s disturbed childhood. In the life time Barrie had been longing for the mother`s love. But his mother could not really see Barrie. Her eyes were befogged with the image of dead son David. Barrie`s feeling rejected from mother is represented in Peter Pan. Neverland is the place where the inner world of Barrie`s unsatisfied, repressed childhood is reproduced.",이수경 ( Soo Kyung Lee ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103322572
목적(skopos)에 따른 텍스트 내적 요소(intratextual factors)의 변화 - 자기계발서 중심으로,"In the past decade, the Korean self-help book market has grown dramatically. Two major characteristics of the Korean self-help book market are: the majority of bestselling self-help books are translated books; and publishers try to cater to the social/ cultural needs of “readers” by conducting market research and creating a relevant text format. As readers and publishers take such an important place in self-help books, Skopos theory which emphasizes the roles of readers and publishers in translation process is best suited to explain the internal mechanism of self-help book translation and publishing.
Skopos theory says the form and content of a translated text can be adjusted according to its function: and there are 8 intratextual factors(subject matter, content, presuppositions, composition, non-verbal elements, lexic, sentence structure, and suprasegmental features) which can serve as major factors in analyzing a text(Nord, 1991: 81). This study analyzed and compared characteristics of 5 texts originally written in Korean language and another 5 texts translated from English into Korean, and studied how translated texts reflect genre conventions of target language texts in terms of intratextual factors.
