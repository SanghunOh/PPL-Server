Among them, watching a movie is a factor that always dominates the surveys asking about leisure or hobbies, but the theater performance of Korean films rapidly contracted due to the limitation of the movie screening time. OTT is a term that originated from the set-top box of an existing TV, but recently, with the development of networks, real-time video streaming became possible. OTT refers to a system that allows you to freely view dramas, movies, entertainment, and entertainment from video service providers such as YouTube, Netflix, TV, and Wave. The current situation is that the COVID-19 outbreak of just two years has brought the Korean film industry back to what it was 20 years ago. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand how the continuously growing OTT platform market can change the future of the theater-oriented film industry. This is because movie-related companies and visitors are watching the media trends led by OTT to see what will happen to the movie industry in the future in line with the current situation where Corona 19 has not yet ended.

Third, it is expected to contribute to the growth and development of horizontal films and the film industry by revitalizing independent films and diverse films and increasing investment in original content. Fourth, changes in viewing patterns and movie promotions due to the increase in real-time streaming. OTT allows you to watch movies through real-time streaming, and this change in movie viewing will bring changes to the area of publicity through OTT service homepages, etc.",육정학,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108142440
시대에 따른 스트릿댄스의 개념과 범주 변화,"This study examined changes in street dance concepts and categories according to the times. About 70 years have passed since 1960 when Locking, considered the most historical and oldest in the street dance category, and in order for street dance to evolve and enjoy like ballet and be recognized by everyone, academic consideration and reproduction of the resulting value must coexist. Literature research was conducted based on prior research and interviews with related experts, and the results are as follows. The word street used in street dance has a symbolic meaning of a space of culture that is not just a street, but an informal and freely formed, and based on this, the concept of street dance in the early days was formed. The music, fashion, language, and social background enjoyed by those who formed the culture during the time of street dance were combined to form a new subculture. And before hip-hop music and culture occurred, street dance of the time, popping, locking, and waacking, belonged to that category. Since then, the break beat generated by DJing, the established street dance, and the current B-boying have become known through the media under the name of break dance. Soon after, hip-hop music occurred. Soon, the culture was defined, and break-dancing became known as a dance of hip-hop culture, and the distinction between hip-hop dance and street dance became unclear. The identity of hip-hop music and culture will be solidified, and new dances such as house dance and voguing, which were born in a separate background from freestyle hip-hop, will fall into the category of street dance. Due to technological development and changes in society, the space for forming an informal culture was expanded to online, and a new dance field emerged based on this. This new dance had a similar development pattern to established street dance in the early days of its occurrence, but experts in the field are now opposed to belonging to it, citing the characteristics of the field. However, the characteristics of the field they claim are common phenomena in all established dance fields that have appeared in the past and are changing according to changes in society. Currently, so-called ""choreography"" does not have its own characteristics different from street dance that has changed with changes in society. If you continue to insist on the distinction, the distinction between cultural perspectives on dance creation and enjoyment methods such as ""practical choreography"" or ""free choreography"" is clearer, not as a dance genre. In this study, the movement form of the dance field is considered to belong to the category as a new detailed genre such as Practical Freestyle, which is not limited by the evolved form or movement form of the established street dance detailed genre. And after this study, it is suggested that conceptual exploration of the detailed field of street dance should be conducted, and that research on the concept and identity of the new dance field should be conducted in more detail.",정지원(Jung Ji-Won),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108735476

고대 이집트 신앙과 내세관 연구 -오시리스 신화와 장제 문서를 중심으로-,"The Pharaoh civilization is one of the oldest civilizations in human history and the cradle of human civilization conceived of Pharaoh.
The Pharaoh civilization laid the foundation for the development of the future civilization across religion, writing system, mathematics, medicine, art, astronomy, architecture and so on.
The mental culture and academic achievements established by the ancient Egyptians became the basis of civilization and cultural development not only in Egypt but also in the Mediterranean region and the whole human society.
In particular, the ancient Egyptians tried to solve their curiosity about life, death, and the afterlife and they had a primitive and religious system.
Egyptian thoughts, understandings and ideas about the afterlife created numerous Egyptian myths, mummies and pyramids.
The Egyptians’ imagination seems to have had a profound effect on the customs and thought systems of Abraham’s religion, such as Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Therefore ancient Egyptian mythology has more historical value than mythology. The various myths and manuscripts recorded in ancient Egyptian tombs became a vivid record of ancient Egyptian society.
For the ancient Egyptians, myths and patriarchal documents are not just stories of gods or imaginations of the afterlife, but another kind of historical document that contains their perception of the universe and their understanding of life and the nature that surrounds them.
Therefore, in this study, through the Osiris myth and the funeral texts, a representative myth among ancient Egyptian myths, I try to analyse the belief system of the ancient Egyptians and their perception of the world and the afterlife
In particular, I research the perceptions of their lives and the influence of customs on future Abrahamic religions.
