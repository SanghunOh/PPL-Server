AI is no longer only considered in engineering and medicine, and it has a lot of influence on the art world. This research analyzed the possibility of image generation artificial intelligence, focusing on beauty model photography among advertising photography. First, analyzing the current utilization status of artificial intelligence and conducted a total of two surveys on consumers who may consume beauty products. The survey provided both the actual beauty and artificial intelligence images which was produced as a Midjourney program. In the first survey, the sample group was asked a subjective question, and in the second survey, a total of 10 images were randomly presented to conducting a preference survey was conducted. As a result of the first survey, positive and negative answers were presented as to whether advertising photography could be replaced with artificial intelligence images, and the results of the second survey showed high preference for artificial intelligence images in most Questionnaire. This study is focused on artificial intelligence in advertising photography, and it is expected that many photographers will be interested in the development of artificial intelligence as well as the advertising photography industry in the future.",장유진 ( Youjin Jang ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108702902

이미지 생성 인공지능의 가능성과 한계 - 한국 초상화 기반 생성사진 제작 사례 -,"This study examines the performance and limitations of image-generative artificial intelligence through actual generative photo production. The goal is to identify the possibilities and problems of generative artificial intelligence by generating images that are visually no different from photographs based on machine learning of Korean portraits. The images produced using generative artificial intelligence based on Generative Adversarial Networks not only maintained similarities with portraits, but also showed very realistic visual characteristics. However, although the generated image looks like a photograph, the Chosun's hat expressed in the portrait were not synthesized properly. In other words, generative AI has revealed its limitations in transforming and distorting elements that are not in the learning data. In addition, when the GAN value is set to 100, in short, in the case of fully automatic generation, all portraits showed convergence to the stereotype. It means that the characteristics of individual characters disappear. After all, the direction of generative artificial intelligence has been decided, and the ultimate result is the world of robots. To combat this contradiction and grim prospect, active human intervention is required.",박평종,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108714572

"기술매체 기반 미술의 근본문제 - 사진, 뉴미디어, AI -","This article deals with the main issues of art based on technical media leading to photography, computer based new media, and AI. Photography, which was born as a technical medium in the 19th century, became an important axis of contemporary art by combining it with digital technology and computers that quickly spread in the late 20th century. The so-called “AI project,” which started in 1950s, was rapidly developing into the 21st century, and is encouraging the evolution of the technical medium. Digital technology and computer engines are now at the center of contemporary art. The direction of this change is clear. In other words, the automaticity of the program is becoming more advanced. Photography, the first technical medium, started with 'low-level automation', but through computers and new media, 'high-level automation', such as an AI engine, is rapidly progressing. In this process, the original intention of human beings who planned the program disappeared and only 'functional automatism' remained. This is why the criticism of the technical media should consider this issue of “self-exclusion” as an object of reflection.",박평종 ( Park Pyungjong ),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107844196
영상커뮤니케이션 방법론에 대한 고찰,"The theorization of the artistic representation of anamorphosis is rather recent phenomenon. The first sustained theoretical conceptualizations, though not yet full-length studies, of visual studies example of the visual images were undertaken in the late 1920s by Walter Benjamin. After him, the processing of looking has been more widely theorized, and full-length studies have now been dedicated to this subject. Of all contemporary theories that can help us understand how viewers make meaning, psychoanalytic theory has addressed most directly the pleasure we derive form images, and the relationship between our desires and our visual world. One of the fundamental elements of psychoanalysis lies in its demonstration of the existence and mode of operation of unconscious mental processes. According to psychoanalytic theory, in order to function in our lives, we actively repress various desires, fears, memories, and fantasies. Hence, beneath our conscious, daily social interaction there exists a dynamic, active realm of forces of desire that is inaccessible to our rational and logical selves. The unconscious often motivates us in ways which we are unaware of, and, according to psychoanalysis, is active in our dreams. One of the primary elements of the concept of the gaze is a kind of. split that viewers experience in looking at images. This is related to Lacan' s notion of the alienation that results from the split between seeing the images as oneself and also as an ideal - as both the same and not the same as oneself. This can also be understood as the split that results from being simultaneously the surveyor and the surveyed, in looking at oneself through the implied gaze of others. The split self of the viewer is always connected to the idea that the gaze is omnipresent. In this article, I have focused on the role of the viewer in making meaning of the images, and theories about the gaze as the signifier of a trauma in visual communications.",손병돈,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45041458
다큐멘터리 영상 분석 방법에 관한 연구,"A study on the analytic method of documentary image - centering on the Television documentary ""Nakdong Gang"" -
The far - reaching influence of visual communication media can be considered as one of the most important factors among modern cultural phenomena at the time of incoming 21st century. Television documentary has its own distinctive meanings among visual communication media which have broad influence.
The purpose of this thesis is to study analytic method of documentary image. In order to achieve this purpose, television documentary ""Nakdong Gang"" which was broadcasted by Daegu MBC from 18:40 to 19:30 Jan. 1st in 1996 was chosen as a analysis text
To examine the intrinsic nature and characteristic of image as a visual language this thesis have 2 issues as follows.
Subject 1: What kinds of elements is the image expression of television documentary ""Nakdong Gang"" composed?
Subject 2: What is the function of image and how is the image expressed?
It is based on not by sensuous theory but by perceptual theory.
Color, shape, composition and movement were chosen as analytic factors. Every image is made by light. Without light, no image can exist. Light is perceived as color and color reflects reality because shadows also have their colors.
And these factors can be perceived by our eyes in the form of point, line and plane. Perceived image is expressed by a composition. The intention and meaning of cameraman can be exposed from this point and the cameraman uses movement to enhance the effect of visual image.
This thesis analysed image components to understand the characteristic of TV image, one of the most important mass media. The essential object of this study is to find the meaning of image. That is to speak, every image uses multi-meaning image language to achieve successful communication.
Most people think it is very difficult to analyse images because it is perceived naturally. However, We can understand the intrinsic meaning of image expression by finding some rules in the images.
This researcher started this thesis with a critical mind about what function expressed image factors have, to analyse image documentary and tried to find out 4 factors to suggest the possibility of image analysis in the Subject 1.

Bazin defined the photography as an auto-generated image, and Flusser defined it as the first technical image and saw the property as the program’s automatism. The core of the image production method using computer programs and algorithms, which are rapidly evolving in recent years, is automation. In this regard, it can be said that the artificial intelligence image inherited the automaticity of photography. The problem here is that humans are excluded. The same problem occurs not only in the production process of images, but also in the process of receiving and distributing images. This is because it automatically accepts information that is automatically calculated.

Even when the subject of photography was women, the degree of exposure differed from medium to medium. The main contents of the photo report were “physical athletic ability” and “the joy, pleasure and cheers of victory.” However, the Chosun Ilbo showed a lower percentage of reports related to COVID-19 than the other two media companies. The theme of all newspapers was “victory advantage.” However, the increase in the proportion of humanism is interpreted as meaning that the tendency to report gold-oriented past Olympics is changing.",안준철,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107923943

Stockings are more than a simple consumable and have a duality that makes them accept the inconvenience of wearing to supplement the desire for body beauty. Photographer Hyejung Yang deals with the subject of passion and obsession for beauty as a two-sided psychological action projected on stockings through this work. However, she no longer used stockings to symbolize the oppression or the complex produced by obsession. Instead, Yang tried to reproduce the psychological desire for a slender leg shape as a positive photographic image combined with joy and freedom. In the process of contemplating, photographing, cutting, attaching, and assembling stockings of various designs, the obsession that has been secretly working so far begins to appear healthy to the outside.

빌렘 플루서의 ‘無 의미’를 통해 본 디지털사진의 푼크툼 연구,"Flusser regards human history as the historical change in codes of images, texts, and technical images. He says, “decoding the meanings of technical image is jumping into the empty universe and will never been decipherable.” This study is intended to find the clues that he left in hope of their being decoded and consider how the meaning of empty universe is decoded through photography, the first technical image.
First, photography is a device based on gaps. The nature of thinking in text that has a desire for “personal narrative” is inherent in technical image. Taking Wolfgang Iser, an aesthetician of reception, as an example, it can be said that a work is reified by filling up the gaps and indeterminate elements through “personal narrative” of the recipient. Second, the symbol used for classifying the history of codes by Flusser is divided into ‘a sign agreed upon’ and ‘a sign to be agreed upon’ according to the consideration on Peirce, a semiotician. Decoding ‘a sign agreed upon’ is available through unilateral acceptance while decoding ‘a sign to be agreed upon’ is available through “metonymy by recipients.” Third, following the texts by Flusser, the character of empty universe is defined as “to have infinite potential, possibility and inevitability, no unchanging truth or objective meaning.” Here Flusser himself says: “The value of truth in photography is meaningless.
Probability calculation and indeterminacy are dominant.” Based on Flusser’s theory, classical photography and digital one have the same position in ontology. It was observed that their principles and processes of decoding are identical, and therefore, digital photography also owns studium and punctum. Conclusionally, it can be seen that decoding technical image, especially photography, derives from the recipient-oriented interpretation and the recognition of potentials of its infinite meaning.",오철민,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108203039
포스트모더니즘 시대의 불확정성의 역할,"The Role of Indeterminacy in the Post-modern Era: Focused on Inter-disciplinary Art Works
Sohn, Byoung-Dohn
With my thesis paper, I am intending to the question 'do-construction', which has been said by Jacqes Derrida who is one of the contemporary French philosopher about post-modernism, that involved a way of reading that concerned itself with 'do-centering' with unmasking the problematic nature of a center. It has been reinforced the notion that we are prisoners of our personal perspective(called Certainty), and so it has been paid attention to the subversive practice of reversing ones perspective. Both reverse (and re-reverse) have been opposites such as subject/object; truth/error; moral/amoral which are called 'binary opposites', with one term of the opposition central and the other marginal. Keeping an eye on the idea of post-modernism, I try to analyze Indeterminacy, one of the factor being made up post-modernism, into art area how to have an effect on it.
This thesis paper, therefore, focuses on comparing inter-disciplinary art works, and then revealing the structure of aesthetic distance between modernism and post-modernism. In the modern era, inter-disciplinary art works assumed parody aspects. It connotes that through borrowing other disciplinary works or the part of them, they have an intention in which they overthrow the aura of borrowing objectives as well as make firmly the position of parody ones, but rather cooperates with other disciplinary works or the part of others. In that point, I argue that there are both the reform and the conservation of modernism ironically in a sense, the mixed denotative sense and connotative one of modernism.
Another powerful influence on Indeterminacy in recent years has been post-structuralism. This is a diverse movement, but I shall mention Just two of its most influential strands: Derrida's 'deconstruction', I have already mentioned above, and the work of Foucault. Foucault's work is also based on a rejection of modernism. He stresses the fact that society is a socio-historical phenomenon, one which functions as part of the process of surveillance and control, which he sees as the central feature of modern society, Its products reflect its social character, rather than representing some world that is independent of it. Foucault argues that different 'regimes of truth' are established in different contexts, reflecting the play of diverse sources of power and resistance. Thus, what is treated as true and false is constituted through the exercise of power Like philosophical hermeneutics, Foucault also led to questioning of the idea that we can capture the meanings even on the basis of which people act, and it did this on related grounds: that meanings are not stable. Thus I have tried to fill in the void in various ways, have tried to establish a new center: with Modernist art, with myth, with music, with poetry, with absolute scientific certainty, with structuralism, with Modernism.",손병돈,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40093750

Computer is considered as a tool to create photographs and since photography become the part of multimedia, it is really hard to distinguish it from animation, virtual reality and so on. As a result of that, not only people in photography industry but also photographic education are confused to choose right way to go. No one can prospect the future of photography with confidence but if we anaylize the tendency of industry related with photography, that might be the one way to get an answer.

평면적인 피사체에 입체감을 부여하는 추상적 사진 표현에 관한 연구,"Like painting, photograph as a planar art is to represent a three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional surface. In this process, some graphic methods such as overlapping, vertical, diminution, and aerial perspective are applied to give a sense of space. Once in painting, camera obscura, which became the prototype of modern camera, was used to apply realistic expression and the precise perspective. A three-dimensional object is concurrently expressed with a sense of space when represented on a photographic surface as perspective is naturally applied to it. However, a planar object has no way but to be shown in two-dimensional on a photograph. All objects are essentially not plane even if they look flat, but there are some occasions to feel a sense of space on the mental level. This experimental work aimed at representing planar objects on the depictive level with a sense of space so that it can work on the mental level as well. In the methodology, we used light and dark contrast according to the push and pull theory of Hans Hofmann and sharpness and blurriness in focus based on the nature of photographs of Stephen Shore.

Through this, this paper examins how the identity of documentary photographs that fight to reveal the ""truth"" in the turbulent digital age can be maintained and changed.Manipulated photographs affect our perception and attitude toward an event. This is why reports after the incident should be accurate. This is because even readers with accurate information can change their perceptions and attitudes by distorted photos reported later. Documentary photographers must create a true relationship of 'consideration and care' with the person who is the subject of the photograph, and we who see the photograph must also strive to hear their true voices. Readers who see a picture of someone's pain must coexist in the same time as the person in the picture.

At that time, the meaning of the picture can be alive and breathing.",김성민,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108714574

5 . 18 광주민주화운동 관련 기록사진의 발굴 및 분석,"It could be seen through this research that the formal photo records were very few and feeble for 5.18 Kwangju Democratic Movement in 1980 considering the historicity and the great influential power which the movement itself possessed. Particularly, as for the photo records of domestic newspapers which stood at the point of an advance guard, the photo record itself and report were extremely few though there were periodic limitations. If the newspapers at that time had recorded and reported the movement thoroughly with photos, the problems of Kwangju would not have ended simply as the problem of Kwangju itself. Moreover, the way which could get access to disclosing the reality could have been opened.
Compared with this fact, the efforts of the partial photo reporters at the front line who tried their best to be faithful to keep the periodic records should be highly appreciated. Though their photos could not be shown in the media of those days, the fact that they could make it easy to get access to the fact of 5.18 Kwangju Democratic Movement in 1980 later through photos was very important. They were very faithful to their inherent duty of recording the fact through records at the circumstance which bore a close resemblance to the actual warfare. It can be said that they again proved the attribute of verifying the fact which photos possessed by means of their photo records.
On the other hand, as seen in the frame of photo analysis of <If The Day of May Comes Again> or photos by the reporter, Na Gyeong-taeg, the ongoing process and problems of 5.18 Kwangju Democratic Movement in 1980 could be seen. Furthermore, the fact that Kwangju citizens were not the mob but the people who had resistance spirits which had earnest desire for democratization and mature citizen consciousness could be recognized through the analysis of photos themselves. In addition, the efforts of the social organization such as <Justice-Peace Committee of Kwangju Head-Parish of Catholic Church> which gathered photo records at that time and actively utilized them for disclosing the real situation and for the movement to publicize the actualities of the struggle should be highly appreciated.
Particularly, 225 photos, which were printed in the <If The Day of May Comes>, including 14 photos which were put in <Schuern>, which was the German weekly News magazine, and 75 photos by anonymous citizens, and 153 record-photos by Na Gyeong-taek were the photo records which could reveal the actual substance of 5.18 Kwangju Democratic Movement in 1980 photographically. And, besides, photos of the foreign press such as AP and UPI can be considered as important records which should be accessed, if possible.
Photos have been positively considered as the best media which can reach the reality of the history and the fact through the role of faithful record of the fact from the very time they were invented. Man had made continuous efforts to develop the value of such photos. We could recognize the importance of the photo records once again through this fact.

영화에 있어서 표현의 자유와 제한상영관의 도입,"Freedom of Expression and Restricted Film Theatre
Yang, Young-chul
The purpose of this essay is to investigate whether or not the Film Rating system in Korea is violating the constitutional Freedom of Expression. Since Movies are a form of mass-communicative art, Freedom of Expression should be applied to it even though it is a form of entertainment and industry as well.
But under our rating system, certain films are limited of the possibility to be showed to the mass. Films of grade R(Restricted Permission-not the same as R of the American rating system) only can be showed at Restricted Film theatres and these theatres are not existed yet. The current Motion Picture Act authorizes the Rating Board to decide Whether or not a grown up person can watch a certain movie and it's explicitly unconstitutional.
So the Board should classify only the movies which they are able to, and those movies which they do not are permitted to be shown at the theatres for 'No rating Movies'",양영철,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40093753
이미지의 컬러 조절에 따른 JND와 선호도 분석; 인물의 피부색을 중심으로,"The purpose of this study is to draw out types of colors and the color adjustment values to enhance portrait photographic images. It is achieved by analysing individual preference and sensitivity changes of test subjects when low latitude facial colors were controlled. Samples has been made with a portrait picture with an average color and brightness, which is varied by six digital colors, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta and yellow. And the properties of each color has been also gradated. Two experiments were done with the samples. First experiment was a JDN test, which is to find out whether and to what extent test subjects can distinguish the color gradation when the samples were presented. Second experiment was to analyze changes in sensitivity, which is done by subjective image quality tests with differed colors and gradation samples. The sensitivity changes were recorded with given descriptive adjectives. The results of experiments showed that heavy variations in color and gradation leads to decrease in preference. And tolerated range of the variation to maintain the same preference with the original image was narrow. Heavy variation may increase artistic value, however such varied images are not preferred since the variation lowers harmony, aesthetic impression as well as capability of the image. Therefore color and gradation change with a portrait images is not recommended and must be applied cautiously.",노연숙 ( Noh Yeon Sook ),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102060019
HDTV 방송 프로그램 제작 환경 변화에 관한 연구,"Nowadays, all the countries are putting their whole energy into the adaptation of the digitalized broadcasting, confronted by a great revolution in the television broadcasting. The change of the system environment foretells somewhat a change in the form of real production. The digital broadcasting with a new media concept (on the basis of HDTV broadcasting), unlike the existing analogue broadcasting, shows a great change in its function and can supply audience with more advanced service. It is different from the past that audience can select to get more various and stereoscopic information through multicasting, excellent sound effect and vivid picture of high definition and quality.
The high definition of HDTV(High Definition Television) broadcasting resulting from this systematic change, however, can't be stably settle down only by the emphasis upon its mechanical characteristics. Therefore, only way through which media of a new concept can be loved by so many people is to satisfy their new desire which they have never experienced by making the most of the characteristics of HDTV. In order to meet the demands of audience, proper programs should be created for HDTV from the stage of their production so that broadcasting can be well operated. In this respect, it would be suggested that staffs related to the actual production of programs must research in advance for the active improvement of changes in the various elements which are significant to the determination of image.
This study also aims to find out some problems concerning changes appeared in the process of transfer from analogue system to digital system, with special reference to the techniques of producing programs, and to draw up a plan to solve those problems. In order to discuss problems in this area, it is necessary to survey a brief history of television as media in Korea and the process of its development with the change of the times, to analyze the situation of the age when the present television has been forced to change with the transition of the various elements to determine image. Thus, it is observed that the progress of HDTV showing promise as a new concept absolutely depends upon the production and the broadcasting of programs fir for the characteristics of HDTV.
Futhermore, it can be expected that a great change would appear in the production of programs in the process of transition from analogue broadcasting to digital broadcasting. In this respect, in order to analyze this, the frame must be fixed with particular respect to camera, light, and set which are significant elements to image making. HDTV has a peculiar ratio of its screen; 16:9, unlike the existing television, and this feature forces the perspective of angle and camera work to be rearranged. As for light, unlike the style of the existing analogue system, it is required to have so much light, and further study concerning this must be continuously conducted. Because much light is required to this system on the basis of high definition. Under this light system, the detailed scenes such as unnaturalness of unrefined set can be clearly observed, and this can cause a deterioration of quality in broadcasting. All the descriptions and performances that have been concealed on the stage are availably presented as they are. In this respect, all participants in the test broadcasting commonly contend that the imitated wooden set must be replaced by the actual furniture or tools.
Therefore, this study attempts to suggest a more affirmative plan about the improvement of techniques in production, because it must be activated in order to play an important role in high definition and quality broadcasting at a minimum of trial and error.",정우근,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30019284

It was in the pursuit of aesthetic view that interpreted the recognition of an object in the organic relationship of human life and society. The photographer insisted that genuine photographs come from the recognition and investigation of the relationship between man and society. The artist advocates that photographs can not inevitably make dodge because of their mechanical duplicate. On the contrary some artists emphasized artistry of salon photographs and photographs of plasticism. The groups had some changes in the tradition that came from the age under the rule of Japanese imperialism. But there was no integration of photographic modes.

I will examine the documentary <My Octopus Teacher>, which contains the special meeting, communion, and healing process between humans and octopus, and analyze its characteristics. Craig, the protagonist, regained his lost purpose of life through the communion of nature, and his surrounding relationships were restored. And through this, it gives healing and comfort to the audience, and makes them look back on the relationship between nature and humans.
Although the documentary does not directly talk about the risk of environmental destruction or animal protection, it conveys another message on how humans should live in harmony with nature as members of the Earth, not owners, by drawing sincere communication between humans and creatures.
In this paper, I would like to examine the content and formal characteristics of the documentary <My Octopus Teacher>, which contains a special connection between humans and octopus. Communication with Craig and Octopus is the main theme that penetrates the entire work. This stage of exchange is analyzed by alternating analysis, and <My Octopus Teacher> also examines that the stage according to the time structure of alternating analysis, which is gradually moving toward the intimate stage, is progressing. And Craig, the cast and producer of <My Octopus Teacher>, was co-founder of the Sea Change Project, and the documentary was produced as part of the Sea Change Project.

흑백과 컬러 사진에서 깊이 지각의 차이,"Expression of depth is one of the most important factors in constructing the creative vision of a photographer. To emphasis the feeling of depth, photographers tend to choose black and white processing. This is because there has been a myth: color photography is flatter than black and white. This experimental study is performed to investigate the effect of the presence of color as a photographic technique on depth perception. The stimuli were taken in color using major factors in changing depth impression, which were then duplicated and transformed to gray scale images. In the result, the smaller aperture size and the longer focal length decreased depth perception in both chromatic and achromatic images. Color severely decreased depth impression at variations of focal length. In the mean time, the flattening effect of color was relatively weak along aperture variations. This implies that spatial frequency is a strong factor in giving a feeling of depth even in color photographs. Black and white process is still common in the field of photography as fine art. From the results of this work, the relatively intense feeling of depth can be one of the reasons for that.",신수진,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45041451

현대미술에서의 사진 매체의 역할,"This paper intends to study the interplay of two media from the perspective of art history as a function of photographic media.
In modernism, photography wanted to build its own aesthetic of photography. Photography is an era expressed in the characteristics of time, quality, and existence of photography. Painters treated photography as an auxiliary means of their work as a material that ensures the modernity of their work. Artists treated photography as an auxiliary means of work as a material for securing the modernity of their work. Modernist photography has moved closer to the essence of the photography media and relied more on the external function as an indicator of the existence of things. In the conceptual art age, photography and art were viewed from the point of view of the use and recognition of the photo media. In particular, even photography has entered an era when the presence of photography is not important in the form of the texture, but should be fully conscious of the mental basis. So, on the contrary, deviations and experiments in which photography mixes with other arts are allowed. This is why photography has become a conceptual art.
In the conceptual art, the dichotomy of photography and art became meaningless. The bigger problem is the realization of ideas, the overthrow of existing ideas. In conceptual art, each medium was borrowed from each other’s needs.
In postmodernism, photography is no longer a dichotomy between art and photography. Because photographic images are the language of the imaging era itself, they become everyday words in themselves. So modern postmodernism contains everyday ideas and photography is applied with non-aur, cultural image, and replicas that symbolize everyday experiences in the mass media era. As discussed above, photography had a great influence on contemporary art history. Since the attempt of photography to resemble painting art in the early days, photography has been sublimated to the art of independent photography, but it is emerging as a genre that provides many stimuli and moments for modern artists.",이용환 ( Lee Yong Hwan ),2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106506293
시각장애인의 자기 표현 수단으로서 사진,"Since the invention of the photography, it has been used by people who are not visually disabled. Even no one has imagined the possibility of the use of photography by the visually disabled. Light makes photography possible. Photography is said as the art of light and the drawing by light. It means that if there is no light, photography can not be made. However it does not mean that people who have trouble with seeing can not take pictures. Until recently, taking pictures by the visually disabled is almost unfeasible, but the development of digital camera makes it possible. In this sense, the idea that the visually disabled can take picture is the change of a way of thinking. In other words, whether people can see or not is not that important. The most important thing is that how people use well photography as a method of self expression on his or her thought. So, to find out what makes the visually disabled take pictures and how it can be used to improve their life, I will sort out photographs taken by the visually disabled and examine the contents of the pictures.",한상일 ( Sang Il Han ),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76543765

The most basic point of views are `low angle`, `high angle`, and `eye level` ones. They are important factors that define characters of an object. It is very important to find the point of view in shooting, too. And characters of an object are defined by relationship with it and the character of viewpoint itself. In the long run, a good landscape has a good-looking position and size for us to see. But it can be seen differently depending on the position of point of view, even if it is the same landscape.

This paper also aim to reveal the physical properties of photography, which make possible photographical resemblance and identification through photography. In an attempt to clarify the relation between photography, resemblance and identification, I don`t want to lean on a semiotic, philosophical approach, nor on a socio-historical one, but rather on both historical and technical one. From here I come to three conclusion. First, photographical resemblance is due to the specific mode of production of photography, and to the structure of human eye and memory of watcher. Second, identification through photography reveal the different mode of visual perception between recognition of face and profile`s. Lastly, identification of two photos signify not only the identity(similarity) of two photos, but also the identity(uniqueness) of the reference of two photos.",박상우 ( Sang Woo Park ),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76543753
디지털카메라의 감도변화에 따른 노이즈증가와 색 재현에 관한 비교 연구,"This study investigates the sensitivity of digital cameras. Digital cameras provides easy adjustment of sensitivity and allow to take high sensitivity pictures. However, more high sensitivity pictures means higher noise. Everybody might experience bad pictures due to noise generated after pictures were taken. If we investigate pixels of dark object, we can notice that noise consists of pixels and is produced by a random color on pixels. If the exactly same color we see in real world can be reproduced, there is nothing to be a problem. As a result of this, the importance of high sensitivity is re-emphasized in taking a picture of an object in a dark place. Recently, it is widely distributed in the cyber world that a new Nikon camera shows lower noise. The real effects of noise on color reproduction and range of changing color according to the changes in sensitivity have been identified.

"참여적 자화상으로서의 인물사진 : Being a Queen, Face of Face 시리즈를 중심으로","The requirements for portrait photography are premised on the fact that the photographer and the subject are together in one space. In other words, a photographic image is formed as a single overall result through small and large interactions and empathy in space and time where the photographer and the subject person coexist.
The two photographic series to be introduced in this article both have the structure of the process of acting (performance) and the image as their result. And the process of making a photo is not aimed at capturing any moment or finding and recording the characteristics of a person, and the conditions for who the subject will be are given regardless of their appearance. Rather, it is made up of voluntary ‘choice’ and ‘participation’ by those who want to understand and participate in the conditions given by the artist, and as a result of their act of participation, the characters ultimately experience the way they see themselves. The author sees these processes and technical conditions as the meaning of ‘self-portrait as participation’.
In this paper, Korean and foreign theorists introduced and interpreted the process from the conception stage to the production process and exhibition in Europe and Korea of the project Being a Queen (2007/2009) realized in Denmark and Face of Face (2016) produced in Korea.

광고사진의 미니멀리즘적인 표현에 관한 연구,"Minimalism emerged in the 1960s after World War II. This was influenced by environmental factors such as economic collapse and social culture after World War II. As a proposition expressing the characteristics of minimalism at the time, German modernist architect Mies van der Rohe Schule described the characteristic of minimalism as “less is more.” Afterwards, it was challenged by Robert Ventury’s “Less is Bore,” but minimalism continues to this day along with the deep-rooted oriental beauty of blank space.
Modern people live in fast rhythms, high frequencies, and constant visual and nerve tension. Therefore, as a reaction to these environmental factors and as a result of enrichment and confidence, the trend of minimalism is spreading, abandoning falsehood and decoration and pursuing a philosophy of simple and simple emptiness. In other words, minimalistic expressions that promote simple beauty by preserving deep inner emotions are spreading.
The effect of minimalism expression in advertising was found to be relatively effective in advertising attitude, brand attitude, and purchase intention. In particular, advertising photos are an important means of disseminating product information and facilitating product distribution. Therefore, advertisement photos should reflect the product's shape, structure, performance, color, and purpose to stimulate customers' willingness to purchase. Therefore, the expression style is very important in advertisement photography. In this study, the meaning of minimalism expression in advertisement photography was found by analyzing the representative minimalism style advertising photography works and analyzing the expressive characteristics and rules. In other words, the simplification pursued by minimalist advertising photography and the rich information contained in it correspond to the modern pulse seeking energy conservation and efficiency. In addition, the characteristics of minimalism advertising photography are: First, it has a sense of taste and beauty, and second, it uses blank space rationally. Third, it has a pure and clear purpose. Fourth, the screen is readable and meaningful.",포정달,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108571843

영화 <하얀 리본>의 폭력에 관한연구 - 문화인류학과 정신분석 이론을 중심으로 -,"This study researches various “nature of violence” seen in the film < White Ribbon (2009) > by Michael Haneke. The direct reason to start this study was that the term “violence” in everyday life contains various implications, but that there aren`t many specific studies. In verbal sense, the term violence refers to different concept according to the one who says the word, and in the words shared by attacker and victim, it refers to opposite concept. “White Ribbon”, the major subject of study is a film set in Northern Germany before WW1. The film contains verbal and physical violence as a black education. Haneke explored the “root of evil” which penetrates the film with such education, connected violence in modern family culture with the origin of German fascism and caught the link of violence. This became the clue to historically interpret the relationship between German fascism and family culture, and even expand such idea to the problem of European society. As for the theoretical tool, the study examined Rene Girard from cultural anthropological approach, and confirmed the influence of violence to human psychology from psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan to Slavoj Zizek. As for the “root of evil” which is the background of violence, philosopher Hannah Arendt came to help. Five fathers in the film resort to verbal and physical violence in front of family and public place in common. In this part, Michael Haneke said in an interview with Mongrel media about the connection of his film to current issue of Europe regarding the verbal violence as below. There is nonstop fascism in France, Austria, Germany, everywhere you look, in how people treat each other. The verbal violence they use. They don`t treat the person as a person but as someone to be manipulated: this is daily fascism. According to Rene Girard`s logic, violence of father is delivered to children as the form of “violence reciproque”. The interesting part is that excluding the accident where the doctor fell from horse because of rubber band among the violent accidents that children plotted, there was no direct physical violence against adults. It can be interpreted as children who are used to violence and discipline of adults are not assured enough to face the adults. Also, it is another problem that the children`s crime is very close to realistic violence occurring in society. As the result, according to Lacan`s psychological analysis, there was sadistic Jouissance of father, the center of symbolic authority in film “White Ribbon”. To children, father`s authority is transcendental power which they cannot come close to. The influence of suppressive violence in church, school and family to man was traced. As for the result, the crime of children occurred without any ethical awareness or guilty conscience. Children who are the being of instable ego boundary are too conscious of others and use violence to others because their ego boundaries are unclear. Therefore, fathers are completely responsible for children turning into ugly criminals.",김석원 ( Kim Seok Weon ),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103182809

포토저널리즘에 있어서 소셜미디어 스토리텔링에 관한 연구 -오바마 정부의 백악관 사진을 중심으로-,"This paper investigates the structure of `social storytelling`, a special case of social media, analyses the media environment surrounding photo journalism, and predict the future of the photo journalism. To do this, the paper takes into account the `photos of the Obama administration in the White House` as a representative examples. The paper performs `strategic` research by looking over Obama`s communication behaviors with the public. And then it goes to the `structural` research to deepen the understanding of mechanism of social storytelling.The main result of the two-stages study on the photographs of Obama in White House is that, the photos maximize effect of communications with the public by utilizing `private` social media, based on the traditional White House photographs. The `private` photos that captured Obama`s frank and intimate everyday routines successfully appealed the public`s favor. This way of communication was successful mainly because of the grassroots democracy of the American society that prefers `individual` and `communication`, and this horizontal and bilateral communication culture is the fundamental main driver for the social media and the Obama`s pictures to have private and participating properties.The democratic structure of the social storytelling is explained by the concept of`Kommunikologie`, argued by Vilem Flusser. According to the concept, The Obama`s `private` pictures in White House has a `communicative` property that `reproduces` more information in the process which is produced and distributed by individual agents. This is contrasted with the `discourse` that aims to distribute an information in a closed way to preserve it. The communicative property is a fundamental base for `Network conversation`, the structure of opened and bilateral communication. The pictures of Obama have been a symbol of social storytelling by `communicating` with `individuals` and thus they finally created the new dimension of delivering information in a social network, the opened network.",김보령 ( Kim Bo Reung ),2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103182811
