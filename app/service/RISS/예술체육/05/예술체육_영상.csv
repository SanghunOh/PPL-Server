Virtual YouTubers are a new content that is similar to characters in animations with stories and fixed movements, but seems active and interactive through real people moving behind the characters.
In order to recruit famous influencers and celebrities, there are many interesting aspects or considerations. However, if you use virtual characters, you can not only greatly reduce production costs, but also be free from negative images (school violence, drinking, etc.), and above all, you can use them without restrictions on schedules. In addition, it is surprising that among the real-time live broadcasts on YouTube around the world in 2021, the first to ninth places are 2D-produced virtual YouTubers. For this reason, virtual YouTubers are actively used for publicity not only by individuals but also by companies.
With the development of SNS, there are more opportunities for anyone to easily promote themselves, allowing them to produce media in their own way using various platforms. Virtual YouTubers are attractive in that they are members of the popular society but can escape the group’s restraint by not revealing the face of the actual person and ensuring anonymity. If an individual can produce a virtual character, the service is expected to be developed in more diverse forms in the future due to the advantage of being able to communicate with the public through characters that can replace them based on anonymity.",박영우,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108411573
대체 현실 게임과 리얼리티 쇼의 결합- TVING 오리지널 콘텐츠<여고추리반>을 중심으로,"Recently, mystery game reality shows are being created during different season using various game designs. This study investigates how an alternate-reality game can be used in game design, focusing on High School Mystery Club, which has been produced up to season two as the first original content by the TVING network. Alternate-reality games are divided into the transition stage that connects the game to reality before the game is played, the stage of the running of the game, and a sharing stage that connects the game experience to the real world after the game is played. By applying this to a reality show that includes a pre-meeting of trailers into a special episode, we developed a model and applied it to High School Mystery Club. The transition phase includes the first game played in the pre-meeting and the opening mission. In the stage in which the game is run, a girls' high school and the entire village serve as the stage for the game, with the cast members interacting with characters such as students and teachers to uncover hidden background stories. Various forms of media, including social media, are mobilized to break down the boundary between the game and reality, as if the schools and characters actually exist. The cast members act as group detectives and acquire new identities, and the audience also interacts with the different forms of media, becoming closer to the participants of the game. In the sharing stage after the game progresses, reviews from the production team, cast, and audience are shared, and behind-the-scenes stories are shared through student characters' SNS accounts after the show ends. They connect and extend the game experience to reality. This mystery game reality show using the design of an alternative-reality game break the boundaries between the game and reality and thus immerses the cast in the show and broadens the range of opportunities for the audience to participate by moving inside and outside of the show. This study will be helpful for future researchers of the formats of mystery game reality shows, which play an important role in broadcasting content.",이영수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108193944
메타버스 기반 가상박물관의 사용자 참여유형에 관한 연구,"This study aims to categorize user participation methods centering on interactivity and relationships in a Metaverse-based museum exhibition. Recently, several museums at home and abroad have introduced cases that induce user participation while providing an immersive experience through a new type of exhibition on the Metaverse platform. Metaverse-based exhibitions using museum artifacts or works tend to embody actual exhibitions in the virtual space as they are. Accordingly, this study seeks to explore the types of user participation in Metaverse-based exhibitions in order to propose ways to increase user participation. As theresearch method, the method of user participation was investigated through a literature study ofStogner's theory and Simon's participatory museum. Based on this, the intensity of users' participation in exhibitions in museums was classified into active interactivity and passive interactivity, as well as social participation and personal participation according to the method of the relationships with others based on museum exhibitions. By synthesizing these criteria, user participation typesin the Metaverse-based museum exhibition were divided into four types: spectators, explorers, followers, and creators. In addition, examples of museum exhibitions corresponding to each type were found, described, and organized. In a case analysis, the audience type involved the experience of appreciating digital heritage, the explorer type has the experience of acquiring information about digital heritage, and the follower type hasthe experience of communication using digital heritage. It was also found that the creator type provides a space for creation using digital heritage in the museum. Hence, it is hoped that by specifically organizing the types of user participation in a Metaverse-based virtual museum, this study will serve as a reference for those seeking effectively to implement different methodsof user experience into a Metaverse-based virtual museum.",이은아,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108661019
"카메라 앵글과 Perspective로 바라본 봉준호 영화 연구 －영화 <살인의 추억>, <마더>, <설국열차>를 중심으로－","The purpose of this study is to examine Bong Jun-Ho’s three movies “Memories of Murder”, “Mother”, and “Snowpiercer” from the viewpoint of camera angles and perspective. Basically, camera angles refer to high, low, and eye-level angles. In this study, however, these will be outlined in more detail, and thus the eye line, the Rule of Thirds, and the Golden Ration will be discussed and the extreme One-Third Rule, which is additionally derived from the earlier elements, will be used as a basis. There are differences in the law of perspective between the East and West. In this study, among the Western laws of perspective, only the linear perspective, aerial perspective, overlapping planes, and reflection will be used as analysis tools. Among the movies directed by Bong Jun-Ho, the three movies, which were selected as the texts of this study, expressed different types of murder based on murder as a basic material. In these movies, director Bong Jun-Ho portrayed the murder selected as a material in different feels using camera angles and perspective. In this study, the implications of the changes in camera angle and perspective adopted by director Bong Jun-Ho will be suggested in terms of how they were used at which points of the flow to produce which expressions, and the moods created as the result of these attempts will be examined by means of the camera.
This study is likely to provide film students with a guideline on the effective use of camera angles and perspective in the pre-work to convey meanings and feelings simultaneously.",김성훈,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104858613

코로나19 한국영화산업 통계 분석,"The Korean film industry collapsed due to COVID-19. This is because most of the ‘theaters’ generate sales. Theater sales in 2020 are KRW 510.4 billion. It decreased by 73.3% compared to 2019. Sales of Korean movies are 350.4 billion won. It decreased by 63.9%. Sales of foreign films are 160 billion won. It decreased b y 83.0%. Due t o the pandemic, the theater did not have a screen monopoly or an opening war. COVID-19 threatened the survival of the “theater.” The traditional distribution and distribution method of the Korean film industry has also collapsed. “Time to Hunt”, “Call”, and “Seungriho” were released on Netflix to recover production costs. Sales of TV and Internet VOD also declined. TV VOD sales are 336.8 billion won. It decreased by 17%. Internet VOD sales are 78.8 billion won. It decreased by 15.3%. The Korean film industry went down to the 2000s.
In order to leap again, it is necessary to identify industrial problems. And it needs to be improved. COVID-19 has also changed the laws of the market. New distribution and profit models are also needed due to market changes. Normalization of theaters is also important. It is also necessary to change the theater fare for the audience. The theater structure that gathers in space is a disadvantage. There is a need for a solution. OTT platforms continue to grow. We need to make good policies for domestic OTT companies to grow. The biggest victim of COVID-19 is a movie star. Government support measures are also important.
The Korean film industry faced a big crisis. However, the power of Korean movies and the influence of Korean content were also confirmed. There is a saying that a crisis is an opportunity. The government and industry must work together to develop Korean films.","김은주(Kim, Eun joo)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108018888
"<벌새>, 1994년 서울과 폐허의 풍경","This study examines how the allegory of ruins is constructed through the romance narrative of a girl who (in)directly experiences the Seongsu Bridge Collapse in 1994. The subject of the study is the scenery of Seoul, as walked through by Eun-hee (Park Ji-hu) in House of Hummingbird (2018). Throughout the cinematic staging of Seoul, the cityscape is embodied as a landscape with ruins as a symptom in the wake of the Seongsu Bridge collapse and Eun-hee's daily life before the event. The research methods are based on the poetics of ruins and the allegory of ruins. In House of Hummingbird, the landscape with ruins is a visual expression of the shaping of a girl's mental landscape throughout the stageization of Seoul. Achronicity explains the time in a city where has undertaken compressed modernization. The landscape with ruins then reveals Eun-hee's mental landscape, which allegorically takes the shape of togetherness, 'being with,' throughout an ambivalent emotion concerning a shining moment and a traumatic moment. House of Hummingbird reveals the mental landscape of the young girl Eun-hee in Seoul, which undergoing the process of compressed modernization, through the landscape of ruins. It includes transgenerational trauma, that is, post-memory, based on the memory as a generation and as an individual, experiencing the shining and painful times of Seoul. For example, the landscape of ruins, such as an area demolished for redevelopment, creates a crack inside Eun-hee. She then briefly encounters the official history beyond her own personal story to mourn a historical loss and suffering through aesthetic means. The landscape of ruins in House of Hummingbird can be an allegory that reflexively reveals togetherness in the suffering of humanity's history.",남승석,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108057774
게임 튜토리얼의 정의 확장과 유형 분류체계 개발 - F2P게임을 중심으로,"The primary purpose of a game tutorial is to familiarize players with the rules, objectives, procedures and world of a game. This enables them to learn how to play the game and understand its fictional universe, thereby increasing their immersion. By utilizing the taxonomy of educational objects, game tutorials were categorized and structured with the aim of teaching users game contents. This study analyzedthe components of game tutorials based on Bloom's revised taxonomy theory framework, classifying them as educational objects that rely on remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating and creating. Based on this categorization, representative examples of game tutorials were then divided in accordance with the educational aims and objectives and an investigation of the development process of each tutorial element was conducted. An analysis of tutorials in representative games found them to be neither temporally nor spatially isolated from the gameplay nor distinguished from it. This represents a departure from segmented game tutorial design, in which each piece of content is presented uniformly in its introduction,as teaching game content to users cannot solely be achieved by explicitly segmented introductory tutorials. Tutorials are explicitly created and continually offered based on the actual content of a game. They exist in a form that is inseparable from the core game content,and lower-level game content can act as a tutorial for higher-level content. The transformed form of tutorials suggests that there is a need for greater comprehension of what is implied by them. This study has made it evident that tutorials must be designed as a type of curriculum permeating the entire game-playing experience of the user and must have clear educational objectives.",장영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108661021
마블의 트랜스 미디어 스토리텔링 전략 : 완결성과 확장성을 중심으로,"In the recent breaking down of boundaries between content platforms and the rising importance of expandability in the content market, the concept of transmedia still remains in the spotlight as a leading genre of multiplatforming. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has perfectly authenticated the concept and potential of such transmedia storytelling. A well-woven transmedia content has a relatively stable fanbase, with one content acting as a gateway for fans to visit other contents. In addition, the producer can construct his or her own original fictional world by creating and expanding upon the fictional world of the story line based on such fanbase. The characters in this fictional world becomes an original IP, crossing over medium to medium, and comes to possess an industrial value even be yond the content itself. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has perfectly authenticated the concept and potential of such transmedia storytelling. This thesis proposes specific method and direction for a successful transmedia storytelling by analyzing Marvel movies and their transmedia storytelling strategy based on Henry Jenkins’s transmedia theory which consists of four parts: 1) the establishment of an independent platform(multiplaforming); 2) the independent completeness of the story; 3) the connection and expandability of the story; and 4) the potential to promote audience participation as a trend. First we will examine the successful cases of Marvel Studios, focusing on the story’s completeness and expandability which is necessary at the early stages of the content development process. Most movies from Marvel Studios take the form of a 3 act 5 point structure, and has an innate completeness, displaying the conflict, transformation, and growth stages of the characters. The stories created in this way are merged using the method of spin-offs and crossovers to contribute to other stories. Moreover, the expanded story line and the underlying clues planted in each story call forth an active participation of the audience, forming another trend in the market. This thesis is expected to act as a checklist in developing multi-platforming content in the Korean cultural industry market where successful cases are yet to be seen.","송예진(SONG,Yejin)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107894541
AI-인간 협응 영화 제작에 관한 연구- <썬스프링> 분석을 중심으로,"AI (artificial intelligence) has been developing in recent years with a focus on machine learning. In this paper, AI is not regarded as a tool or material but as a co-worker in which creative work is carried out jointly. First, I investigate the trends in AI projects for artistic creation. In the history of AI, attempts to apply this technology to art started in the 1970s and have continued to this day. AI has also been utilized in various areas such as music and literature as well as art. I analyze Sunspring, which was scripted by AI Benjamin, as a research subject for AI-human coordinated producing cinema. The script by the AI Benjamin was an abstract and incoherent text that was difficult to read. However, a human film director adds his own interpretation to the given script to make the seemingly meaningless script meaningful. The director uses filming, editing, and various video techniques to turn an unconscious, fragmented corpus into a continuous image stream of consciousness. AI Benjamin created the script for Sunspring using the artificial neural network of the RNN LSTM model. Although artificial neural networks started by mimicking the brain, there are aspects that can be learned from machine learning, even if we (humans) are not familiar with them. Instead, the unfamiliarity was lifted from the realm of meaninglessness and unconsciousness that had been usually overlooked due to bias. Consciousness and unconsciousness coexist with continuity and discontinuity, akin to a zoetrope or movie. Consciousness can emerge in the flow. Through the collaborative creation process between AI and humans, humans will have an opportunity to mirror their self-image on AI.",김정한,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108193322
청각장애를 소재로 한 영화에 나타나는 셔레이드 기법 분석 - 사운드 오브 메탈을 중심으로 -,"Since the production of films, the image expression technique called ‘Charade’ has been settled down as a means for delivering meanings in silent films. Originally, the root of Charade could be found in the ancient pantomimes as one of the popular games in medieval Europe. Among the expression methods of Charade, the delivery of meanings and situation through gesture and facial expression was not only an essential element to silent film actors, but also a measure for evaluating actors’ ability.
The development of the film industry and the diversification of film genres led the evolution of film language and grammar, which was led to the expansion of the concept of Charade that used to be limited to gesture and facial expression. Not only the means of mise-en-scene such as costume, props, venue, camera movement/composition, and lighting technique, but also the auditory elements were additionally included in the range of Charade. Especially, considering the recent trend of films, the sound is realizing Charade in the almost-equal relation with the visual area.
Darius Marder’s <Sound of Metal>(2019) is a film based on deafness, which effectively used the Charade technique mentioned above. This film is realistically describing the agony and its overcoming of a young street performer who unexpectedly lost his hearing, in connection with the condition of sound.
This thesis analyzed the narrative structure of this film, and also extracted and deeply analyzed the Charade technique reflected into this film. Especially, this thesis considered the cases of applying the counterpoint of vision and hearing in the aspect of sound, situation according to the movement of hearing point, and internal change of characters, which could work as a sight of films with the motive of hearing in the future.",박지훈,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108411582

아키비스트로서 마르셀 뒤샹 연구,"Archives began to appear after the 2000s in relation to strategies and discourse focusing on contemporary art. Recently, large-scale exhibitions by international curators such as Okwui Enwezor and Massimiliano Gioni have used archive strategies and methodologies, proving that archive discourse is a hot topic. In a general sense, archives are a system that physically hosts historical information, materials, and objects according to a certain system and method. The well-known artist Marcel Duchamp, a pioneer in contemporary art, actively used the principles and systems of archives. Although active in cubism, Dadaism, and surrealism, he also inspired pop art, conceptual art, and minimalism, in particular revolutionizing art by creating what was termed 'readymade' through his 1907 work Fountain, created with a urinal. By implementing archival art that reproduces and reprocesses works, he broke away from modernism's originality and uniqueness and opened a new paradigm of art by destroying the stereotype that art should be formative and artistic through text-based archive art. This represents building another narrative by reprocessing works while borrowing an archival format. In other words, it can be considered that another work is produced and a multi-layered context is derived from various archive methodologies and strategies, such as reproduction, placement, display, collection, recording, preservation, measurement, accumulation, and repetition. Just as archives became an investigation in art and art criticism at the end of the 20th century to express diversity in multi-layered areas, including interactions with history, it is believed that Duchamp's archive strategy influenced the foundation of this movement. This study will be meaningful in that it analyzes the art world of Duchamp from the new perspective of an 'archivist'.",조사라,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108194503
