As an idol product in the virtual world, cyber idols serve as a natural emotional connection. Fragmented entertainment due to the pressure of people’s work, marriage and love, and housing has become popular among cyber idols, and beautiful cyber idols have the advantage of unique emotional involvement for the MZ generation. Rich cyber-idol products have met people’s urgent needs for diversification of mental entertainment in the Corona era, and cyber-idols have exploded over the past two years.
In 2022, more than 30,000 cyber idols registered on the Chinese social platform Bilibili and did live broadcasting activities.
As a commercial product that requires a lot of money and technology, how to proceed with cyber idol products and viewers’ emotional design is a problem to be studied in this paper. American scholar Donald Arthur Norman proposed three phases of the emotional design system and distinguished three phases: instinctive, action, and reflection. These three are closely intertwined in the emotional system, which comprehensively affects human emotions and psychology, and each influences design in a specific way. This paper observes and analyzes three cases of virtual singer, virtual YouTuber, and virtual influencer based on the ‘three stages of sentiment’ theory, and concluded that virtual influencers should focus on the design of the reflection stage while focusing on the behavior stage. The first purpose of this paper is to fill the gaps in theoretical research and design in this field by providing more intuitive theories and methods for the design of emotional systems of cyber idols. The second is to provide references to cyber idol product producers and to improve the economic benefits of the product.",두이루,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660376
왓챠의 다양성 전략과 오리지널 콘텐츠에 관한 연구 -<시맨틱 에러>와 <조인 마이 테이블>을 중심으로-,"Securing diversity in the media can be considered a social value or philosophy to pursue. In today’s rapidly changing media landscape, this paper traces how the increase in the number of platforms contributes to internal and qualitative diversity. It pays particular attention to Watcha, which stands out for its pursuit of diversity among OTTs (Over-The-Top platforms). In the current highly competitive OTT environment, Watcha demonstrates agility and independence by venturing into different themes, materials, genres, and formats. It also explores subculture and minor genres, as well as approaches to minority representation in a sensitive and unique manner. This approach aims to shed light on suppressed or invisible characters and phenomena that go against mainstream ideology and expand perspectives and tastes. The paper’s structure is as follows: In Chapter 2, we examine how the quantitative increase in the number of platforms correlates with securing diversity.
We also discuss Netflix’s efforts to build a differentiated brand image through a long-tail strategy. Additionally, we explore the conditions and motivations driving domestic OTT platforms to seek their own paths. In Chapters 3 and 4, we delve into Watcha as a prime example of diversified content. Chapter 3 focuses on the background and evolving trends of the BL genre, with a detailed analysis of Watcha’s first original drama series, “Semantic Error,” based on a popular BL web novel. We identify the factors that contributed to the success of “Semantic Error.” In Chapter 4, we analyze each episode of “Join My Table,” a food travel program that explores the lives and culture of immigrants who have settled in Korea, highlighting its unique approach. Finally, in the concluding section, we summarize the discussions thus far and include a mention of additional original content from Watcha that is relevant to the same context. Through this exploration, we aim to identify emerging perspectives, aesthetics, and dynamic possibilities in the media landscape.",서영주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660372
웹툰의 장르 변화 양상에 관한 연구,"With the distribution of smartphones, Webtoon has become popular as a pop culture content for the one-person media age. And it leaped into a consuming cultural content which is known as the 'Snack Culture Trend' in a very short time. Webtoon is growing rapidly with the development of social media. Because it can deliver informations and interests more easy and quickly than complex text through images, and because of its openness people can participate and share by comments. As the environment of media moves to the web and mobile, a lot of changes occur in the webtoon market these days. In particular, genres are rapidly changing because teens and twenties become major consumers and their tendencies and concerns are reflected in the contents of the webtoons. A new form of genre evolution is taking place, because their attitudes that constantly reproduces and creates the fashion, newly-coined word, and social issues are expressed in this social media world through parody. And these are reflected in the system of Webtoon. This kind of active attitude leads to a change of new form of genre which is reflected in Webtoon system.
Genre is a common element in popular culture contents and it is one of the most important role in commercial distribution system. One of the genre is succeeded and also it is created by a consumer's demand. In the webtoon industry system, the reader 's taste and reaction, the genre, is very important. The current webtoon industry system has changed a lot from the existing market of published cartoon. More various concepts and materials of works are emerging because the environment for selecting and participating in the work which led by the reader has been set off from the one-sided distribution structure of the publishing company. This kind of active attitude leads to a change of new form of genre which is reflected in Webtoon system. Therefore, the unilateral genre division that has been classified in the existing publishing cartoon market is too difficult to apply as it is in the era of webtoon.
The genre of webtoon is changing to a new aspect as it becomes more subdivided and mixed because of the reader's active intervention. Despite these changes, however, because of the ambiguity of genre division, most platforms still follow the genre division way of the publishing cartoon era. Therefore, new research is needed according to the change of webtoon.
This study analyzes the changes in the current genre of webtoons by comparing the genres of comics and webtoons. Based on this, I'd like to suggest the necessity of distinguishing new genres of webtoons.",김세종,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106519412

중국 애니메이션 <나의 붉은 고래: 대어해당(大漁海棠)> 속 캐릭터의 중국전통문화 형태적 요소 분석 연구,"The traditional cultural archetype is transformed as a source of source, containing abundant historical and cultural resources, and is being recreated as cultural contents of various media. In particular, the animation industry is one of the fields that can discover various traditional cultural prototypes of each country and actively develop and utilize them as source sources. There is an example of successfully combining traditional culture archetypes with content by succeeding and developing such traditional culture. This is the animation <My Red Whale: The Great Fish Party> released in July 2016. In this paper, the cultural archetype of traditional Chinese culture strategically used in <My Red Whale> was analyzed based on formative factors. <My Red Whale> used a traditional costume worn by the character of the character for a fantastic and oriental expression as the representative red color of China, and the modeling of the character was also reinterpreted by borrowing from the classics and myths. In addition, many elements including dreamy and strange landscapes and beautiful flower trees give off the unique Chinese style and atmosphere, its beauty and artistic mood that has been passed down for many years. As such, <My Red Whale> is a work that shows the respect and respect for traditional culture by appropriately grafting and reinterpreting Chinese tradition while using many traditional Chinese cultural elements in image expression, material, and story. The traditional Chinese cultural elements expressed in the animation express Chinese cultural characteristics and not only leave a strong impression in the minds of the audience, but also evoke ethnic impressions. Therefore, this study intends to study the formative elements that appear in the characters of <My Red Whale>.",서한풍,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106950739
TV 애니메이션 매체의 폭력성이 아동에게 미치는 영향에 관한 연구 -<부니 베어>를 중심으로-,"Media violence has always been a hot issue in media effect research. In the process of information globalization, the whole mass media is full of a large number of violent content, even cartoons have violent scenes that seriously affect the physical and psychological health of children. As an important form of visual culture with its unique audio-visual characteristics and aesthetic characteristics, TV animation conforms to needs of children's psychological development in creation and is deeply loved by children. Animation is able to develop children's thinking, cultivate their imagination, satisfy their thirst for knowledge, purify their minds and promote their socialized development. While enjoying the happiness brought by animation, children are also impacted by some negative factors, such as the imperfect broadcast censorship classification system in the spreading channel of animation, excessive violent scenes in animation content, and excessively adult plots involved in animation. Studies have shown that watching violent content of animation (physical violence, verbal violence, violence, horror music), can increase the aggressive behavior of children. Young children have the feature of imitation ability, and imitation during this period is children’s main way to study, in which they obtain learning content by imitation of things. This kind of imitation is conscious imitation, and proactive, and the main way is to “see“ and “hear“. But children in this period lack the ability to distinguish things, so they cannot distinguish and control the content of imitation. At present, the Chinese animation market presents a lot of commercial atmosphere, which makes the concept of children-oriented missing. Too many adult language and violence elements appear in the animation, which violates the original beauty and purity of the animation. The boundary between children and distinguishing information is fuzzy, and animation not only affects children's cognition. Emotion and behavior play an important role in shaping children's outlook on life and values.Based on the consideration of children's imitation characteristics, the society, the government, the school and the guardian should work together to conduct conscious guidance so that children can distinguish right from wrong.
In this Article, we will take the recent Chinese popular animation ""Boonie Bears"" as an example, take samples of and analyze the content of the series, and objectively and clearly illustrate the ""high risk"" violence content in ""Boonie Bears"" in the form of charts. According to the national TV violence research report of the United States, there may be high-risk violence against preschool children in animation. Its main characteristics include: heroization of the subject of violence, surface justice of violence, impunity of violence, no harm to the victims, and very real violence. According to these characteristics, this article analyzes the subject and frequency of violence, the means and nature of violence, whether the perpetrator is punished, and whether the perpetrator is hurt. In order to explore the impact of violence content in the animated work ""Boonie Bears"" on children's high-risk violence, and summarize the corresponding countermeasures.",낙곤,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106640376

This study firstly extracted the representative personality types that make up modern superheroes by exploring two representative branches of the modern superhero genre, Japanese animation and Hollywood superhero movies. Second, through several contexts surrounding modern superheroes, this study The topographical map of identity was specifically traced. The typical personality type of modern superhero characters is created at the point where the physical personality (psychic/ mutant/cyborg/powered person) and the social personality (apostle of justice/antihero/ monster) intersect and combine.
The modern superhero topography is built around four contexts: between humans and metahumans, between saviors and professionals, between protectors and destroyers, and between homo faber and homo deus.
Superheroes in the above two genres are the first generation of superheroes based on digital virtuality, and in this respect, this study is, strictly speaking, a study of the early topography of modern superheroes, which is also an attempt to build a database of modern superheroes.",서수정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660369
동물애니메이션의 원작과 실사화된 영화에 관한 비교 연구 - <라이온 킹> (The Lion King) 을 중심으로,"This study aims to analyze the pros and cons of Disney's remake of animal animation as a live-action movie. As a research method for this, I found out why the first Disney produced the original animation as a live-action movie. Second, I analyzed the work of <The Lion King> (The Lion King, 2019) by dividing it into pros and cons. The analysis was divided into four elements: camera angle, directing aspect, character's emotional expression and dialogue, character's role and appearance. As a result of the study, it is judged that Disney is making the original animation live-action due to its box office performance and ease of creation. The advantage of The Lion King (2019) is that, above all, animal animation is made into a realistic CGI close to documentary. The disadvantages are that the camera angle emphasized for portraying the situation used in the original animation, the imaginative output, the rich character's expression, and the character's traits mostly disappeared. Therefore, it is not desirable to ignore the characteristics of the original work in order to emphasize only realistic movements in remake of animal animation as a live action film.

상호텍스트성에 기반한 스토리세계 확장 전략 연구 -‘히어로즈(Heroes)’ 유니버스에 구현된 트랜스미디어 스토리텔링 사례를 중심으로-,"to secure a large IP using transmedia storytelling.
Nevertheless, in Korea, only media mix strategy-based adaptation of original webtoons proven in popularity is active, whereas the true advance in transmedia storytelling is still very slow. This study diagnoses the reason for such situation as a lack of understanding of the characteristics of transmedia properties, especially the intertextual characteristics, at the content development and production phase.
Transmedia storytelling, which requires participants to traverse multiple media, asks them to recognize the intertextuality between intertexts belonging to the transmedia network and cross as many intertexts as possible.
In view of such situation, this paper intends to provide implications to local media & entertainment practioners by analyzing the intertextuality between the intertexts that make up the “Heroes” universe based on one of the highly successful North American TV shows in the late 2000s. The “Heroes” universe is also a representative example of successful transmedia storytelling which effectively exploited webcomics as a hypertext in constructing transmedia properties. As a result of examining the concerned universe using Howard’s storyworld extension strategy and Ruffel’s ‘migratory cues’, it has been confirmed that webcomics Heroes seamlessly expands the storyworld of the entire universe through strategically structured intertextuality, and induces users to discover and assemble missing puzzle pieces in the vast universe’s timeline through optimized migratory cues. In addition, in order to optimize participants’ immersion, the webcomics is successfully inducing them to feel willing to navigate additional intertexts such as TV shows and alternative reality games. It is expected that the implications of the strategic intertextuality of the “Heroes” universe will provide meaningful insights in improving the monotonous pattern of media conversion currently found in Korea.",조희영,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660373
애니메이션에서 나타나는 여성 영웅 캐릭터의 변화 연구 - 디즈니애니메이션의 여성캐릭터를 중심으로,"In modern society, the media has been used as a way of conveying ideology to the public. Among them, animation is the favorite visual media for all ages, so the ideology delivered through animation has a great impact on the general public.
Disney has produced works based on social and political ideologies that have been the background of their production. They divided gender into dichotomy and made characters to play a gender role based on male chauvinism. However, as the status of women rose, gender discrimination was criticized. Disney also had to change their character. In order to understand Disney's production methodology to reflect the social change, it is necessary to analyze their intentions, features, and character changes. To study this process of change, we first selected Disney's female characters and analyzed their social attitudes, goals, and final behaviors.
As a result, Disney's female characters are now self-directed and show the independence through women's associations, expressing their willingness to pioneer their destiny, and developing themselves through growth. This results show the social leader unlike the past, which was subordinated to men through the system of marriage. But the completed world at the end of the story both past and present is expressed as the result of the completion of the family, and conveys the maintenance of the existing governing system as a message. In other words, Disney placed the women in the position of men in patriarchal ideology, but the completion still expresses the vertical class society as utopia. As a result, Disney's heroes, whether male or female, convey the central message that they must maintain the existing governing system through regression rather than individual freedom.
As the case analysis shows, animation conveys the atmosphere of society. In the past, it was used to maintain the ruling class's power and conveyed specific ideologies. However, with the development of media and the introduction of digital technology, the production and delivery became easy to reflect various opinions of the public. If we analyze animation as a popular culture reflecting the times and learn the methodology, it will facilitate the production of works aimed at the target, which can lead to an example for success.",이혜원,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106519418
영화와 애니메이션의 여성 캐릭터를 중심으로 본 타자와 여성 은유,"Objectifying female characters to express them sexually is a general attitude and custom in visual media, such as animations, and not limited to a specific genre. This is clearly shown especially in the expression of visual image, as one of the individual elements constituting the media. As known already, the expression of women in Japanese animations includes sexual elements even when the audience is not limited to adults. The physical body of female students is visualized in such a sexually suggestive manner that the school uniform they wear would be put into the shade, and realistically highlighted through the angle of the camera and the edition of the images. Such a manner of expression is repeated like an idiom even when the targeted audience is younger. In a greater or less degree, consuming the body of female characters as extreme close-ups and fragmented spectacles is commonly found in all visual media including the Japanese animations. The sexual objectification of the physical body of women seems to be related to the recognition of women in the entire society. In a real world also, women are fragmentally evaluated with the external elements and consumed as visual spectacles as in visual media. In extreme cases against common sense, the victims of sexual violence are found fault with and blamed, unlike other types of crime. In this way, women have been objectified as characteristics of things by the social norm, excluded from the subjects, and placed in the position of the other. This study focuses on the distorted recognition of women that is hidden and hardly detected but extensively spread in the entire society, discussing that the expression of women in the animations has the same problem in the same context as the reflection of the society and culture. From such a viewpoint, the present article analyzes the expression of female animation characters based on the Levinas’ feminine metaphor and the concept of the other, and discusses the relations between the society and the media expression.",오진희,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106640373
가족용 장편애니메이션<인사이드 아웃>에 나타난이행대상(transitional object) 캐릭터의 서사적 활용 연구,"It can be assumed that the reasons why the animation characters, ‘Olaf (in Frozen Kingdom)’ and ‘Minions (in Super Bad)’, etc., which were very successful in the merchandising market while having won the popularity better than the main characters are very popular even though such characters appeared only by playing a funny role while assisting the adventures of the main characters are not only because of their cute appearances but also because such characters have their own core features in their inner world as the transitional object-characters. Simply expressing, a ‘Transitional Object’ as a concept suggested by a child psychologist, ‘Donald Winnicott’, means a lovey doll or an imaginary friend which temporarily replaces an infant’s mother during the procedure when the infant is mentally separated from its mother. However, in case that the theory of transitional objects was applied directly to many narrative content characters for doing a study, there must have been done some studies in advance for establishing some new criteria and indexes related to the transitional object-characters of such narrative contents. Accordingly, while thinking that the ‘emotional relationship’ between a growth-subject and a growth mediator must be dealt with as the most important content in order to define a transitional object-character in a narration clearly, this researcher established some emotional index for judging the propensities of a transitional object-character on the basis of such way of thinking. The index is composed of 4 kinds of emotional roles (quasi-family member, growth mediator, lovey doll, an imaginary friend), 6 kinds of emotional supports (hugging, protecting, accepting, giving the initiative, improving the relationship and mutual supervising) and 4 kinds of emotional impressions (impression by contacting, impression to protect and impression accepting an attack). In case that some main characters of a family feature animation, ‘Inside Out’, are analyzed while the index mentioned above is applied, it was found that ‘Bing Bong’ and ‘Sadness’ have a high propensity as a transitional object-character. Especially, it could be inversely inferred in which ways some good transitional object-characters can help the narrations on growth of a family feature animation by taking a look at the character, ‘Sadness’ that has the highest propensity as a transitional object-character. The transitional object-character, ‘Sadness’ assists the narration on growth internally and externally by helping the internal maturity of a growth-subject in a way of projecting the tasks for the internal maturity of a growth-subject while helping the growth-subject to be successfully externally in a way of providing the growth-subject with some kinds of facilitating emotion.
As the results from this Study, since such kinds of emotional experiences provided by such transitional object-characters are displaced to not only the relevant growth-subjects but also the audience who are emphasized with such growth-subjects as they are, such transitional object-characters play a role of hidden benefactors who induce some immersion into the narrations and provide child and adult audience with various layers of emotional satisfaction.",박형동,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104985818
"내셔널 시네마로서의 <변호인>, <택시운전사>, <1987>","This study has tried to identify the concept of national cinema and its constituent, to diagnose whether the films of the democratization movement such as The Attorney, A Taxi Driver, 1987: When the Day Comes can be viewed as national cinemas. In this study, I have defined national cinema as the film that represents national characteristics and peculiarities by means of showing common historical experiences and memories through the narrative and stylistic aspects and/or that contributes to reconstruction and adjustment of various national identities changing under different political, economic, social, and cultural circumstances. The conditions of national cinema has been discussed with the following categories: ‘what kind of stories were told by what kind of characters? (the issue of the narrative and the character),’ ‘what kind of actors did play?(the issue of actors),’ ‘how did the films represent?(the issue of styles),’ and ‘who did make the film?(the issue of the ownership and anti-Hollywood).’ As the results of the applied analysis of the conditions into the above three films, they transformed the historical moments to historical memories by filming the national resistance of the democratization movement with the national characters representing the period, and at the same time, they have taken the position of Korean national cinema by supporting the audience’s identity reconstruction as a member of the imagined community who did advocate and participate in the democratization movement. The films can be said as a new sort of the democratization movement film in that the narratives based on the real people and true stories directly criticize the cruel past. It seems to be significant that this study applied this new kind of films to the standards of national cinema and added the vocabulary of the democratization movement to Korean national cinemas.",류재형,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105995186
트랜스미디어를 활용한 게임 마케팅 콘텐츠 연구,"In the digital environment, transmedia has become a key concept that encompasses both media content producers and users. Games are indispensable to the discussion of transmedia. This is because the interactive media can create a participatory and procedural character of the game and a place for player interaction. Like alternative reality games, this can be seen in the form of a methodology for transmedia storytelling, or in the form of media converging a fragment of a story while dividing one story world into multiple media. However, the discussion of the transmission media centered on game media does not take much weight in the field of industry and research. In the game media, the transmedian approach except for the expansion of IP is mainly focused on game marketing contents. The purpose of this study is to analyze the transmedia aspects of the game's marketing contents and to examine the direction of the transmedia contents in the game media.
This study looked at examples of marketing content in <League of Legends> and <Fortnite> through Mar Lo Ryan's concept of transfictionality. Unlike the game's transmedia content, which was focused only on expansion and transformation-oriented transfiguration, like general transmedia content, the game's marketing content organizes the content and teaches the media around substitution and citation. This provides the player with a meta-world experience formed at the boundary where reality and imagination intersect. The transmedian approach that appears in the marketing content of games aims to blur the boundaries between virtual and reality created by substitutions and citations, rather than filling the gap in the story world aimed at expansion and transformation. This goes beyond marketing attempts and suggests how game-centric transmediary approaches can be made.",이진,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106519415

Although Pixar’s 2017 production, narrates how to face death as a “growing up” theme. <Coco> uses a relaxed narrative style and a unique “growing up” narrative structure to raise the heavy topic of “death”, making the audience immersed in the film while watching the animation.
Through the transmission of deep meaning, the film reflects on death again, understands death from a positive perspective, and tells the story of growth. In this regard, the researcher will focus on the “theme of death” in Coco and analyze the meaning of death from different perspectives. Chapter 2 analyzes the commonality of the spatial composition of Pixar animation through the Greimas’ semiotic square, that is the vinary spatial structure of human space and non-human space. After that, the space-time background of <Coco>is deeply eoplored, and the commonness and personality are analyzed. In the context of binary space, the different contradictory relations of the protagonist Miguel, driven by different desires, are analyzed by Gremas’ actantial model. The third chapter explores the diversity of Pixar animation “growing up” themes by analyzing the themes of Pixar’s different works. And eoplore the “death” theme of <Coco> narrative, use Roland Barthes’ punctum as a bridge to find the recipient’s “growing up” opportunity. In conclusion, the analysis of the commonality and individuality of Pixar’s work in the previous two chapters, Five characteristics of Pixar’s growth theme are summarized 1) Embody the special dualistic way of space, 2) Construct isotopic relationships between characters, 3) Highlight the character’s personality through the contradictory relationship between the characters, 4) Enhance theme sublimation by changing the central character requirements, 5) Strengthen the role of surrounding characters.

미디어 프레임에 등장하는 이상적 아동 -중국 애니메이션 숏폼 동영상 <베이비 버스>에 대한 콘텐츠 분석을 중심으로 -,"As a popular children’s animated short video series in China, BabyBus is showing a huge number of clicks and add-to-favorites on all major video platforms. Taking Tiktok as an example, as of December 27, 2022, BabyBus had had 40.349 million likes and 7.475 million followers. It can be said that its popularity has become a social phenomenon that cannot be ignored. It seems that BabyBus caters to the interests of children and therefore is very well received by many of them. However, What the reasons lie behind this phenomenon? This study takes BabyBus as a case and conducts classification and organization of its short videos according to the theme. Through theoretical perspective of media frame, the BabyBus video collection is evaluated on three levels: theme, content, and form to determine how it shape the image of child as a media framework, and what kind of image of child is shaped.
The study has revealed that the strategy of shaping children’s images through animated short videos for children, represented by BabyBus, involves the following three aspects. First, its theme selected caters to parents’ expectations as seen in the shaping of an idealized child image through a wide range of topics. Its content is aligned with the interests of children. By using gamified story plot and scenes and interweaving some catchy children’s songs, the content is conveyed in an lively and interesting way. Third, the introduction of animation intellectual property (IP) images, which are popular among both parents and children, combined with a presentation in an appealing style of bright colors and cheerful music, has led to significant success. Therefore, through the carefully crafted image from BabyBus, an idealized child image has been conceived: a well-behaved child with a sense of safety, healthy growth, a passion for knowing and exploring the unknown world, the capability of working with others as a team and a willingness to help those in need. The idealized image of children created by BabyBus primarily meets the expectations of parents. However, under the construct of the animated short video media frame, this image has the potential to solidify and raise the public’s expectations of children. Therefore, the study proposes that: Regarding the selection of themes, there is no need to put forward excessive requirements on children in terms of “knowledge and enlightenment” and “emotional intelligence and family affection”. And In terms of content, parents’ expected standard of a well-behaved child should be lowered and the ideal all-round child image should not be overly rendered in the videos.
Formally, the design should be in diversified forms of animation to allow children to enjoy the wonderful realm of the senses.",완쥔,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108660368
