This has resulted in efforts for eco-friendly design, green design, and eco-design, and has led to concerns about sustainable values, resulting in a new category called upcycling. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of environmental awareness of female college students on purchasing behavior of up-cycling cosmetics. In conclusion, the environmental education should be systematically implemented in order to raise the actual environmentally friendly behavior level according to consumers' environmental problems. This has been mentioned continuously in previous studies, and various programs should be supported so that consumers' environmental awareness can lead to environmentally friendly behavior. There is also a need for more active promotion of environmentally friendly activities of cosmetic companies. While eco-friendly behavior of companies contributes to ensuring the sustainability of society, the low level of consumer awareness is that environmentally-friendly activities can negatively impact society's sustainability and expansion. In addition, while the value of consumers who value the environment has a positive effect on the purchase intention, the formed purchase intention does not affect the actual purchase. In this way, in order to induce effective purchase through eco-friendly activities, it is necessary to meet basic product attributes such as quality, safety, and price more than other competing products rather than just ‘eco-friendliness' and ‘up-cycle'.",강명주,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106495117

Dissolving Microneedle Channeling System and ultrasonic treatment have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional treatments such as laser skin resurfacing and Microneedling Therapy Systems (MTS). To address the disadvantages of Dissolving Microneedle Channeling System and ultrasonic treatment, a Sucralfate 0.5% and Vitamin K 3% solution is applied to the Dissolving Microneedle Channeling System, which is known as KS-DMCS, to facilitate wound healing caused by the microneedles. Additionally, an external serum (Ceutisome Serum) containing liquid oxygen cosmetics is used to activate skin cells. Experimental results confirm that the combination of ultrasonic treatment and Dissolving Microneedle Channeling System demonstrates significant improvement. The feasibility test confirms the stability of the Sucralfate 0.5% and Vitamin K 3% solution with the needle array. It is also confirmed that the serum, which contains liquid oxygen cosmetics, diffuses to the target depth without interference from the Sucralfate 0.5% and Vitamin K 3% solution.

외모관리 동기가 네일 소비자 만족에 미치는 영향 : 발톱 관리를 대상으로,"Appearance plays a symbolic role in the judgement of a person s gender, age, socioeconomic status, occupation, etc., and acts as an important aspect for determining overall impressions during interpersonal relationships. In modern society, the importance of appearance is continually increasing, and as a result, people are becoming more sensitive to fashion, and are sparing no effort toward actions that may improve their appearance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to understand the effects of appearance management motivation on customer satisfaction in pedicures, as well as to analyze the differences in influences according to the pedicure method. For this purpose, we analyzed the responses of 368 women in their 10s to 30s who experienced both nail shop and self-nail pedicure methods. As a result of the analysis, first, it was found that trend-oriented and convenience motives of appearance management had a positive effect on customer satisfaction. Second, in nail shops, mood rejuvination motives had a greater influence on customer satisfaction than self-nail, while fashion-oriented motives had a greater influence on customer satisfaction than in self-nail. Based on these results, it is suggested that nail shops need to create an environment for consumers to relax, and self-nail manufacturers need to develop various product designs.",김혜영(Hye-Young Kim),2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107875911
여대생들의 MBTI 유형별 외모 관리 연구,"Female college students actively and boldly reflect their various personality tendencies in developing their appearance. As the MBTI personality type test is openly used as a means of sharing their personality and self-branding, female college students understand their personality type, identify themselves, and express themselves with standardized indicators. A total of 259 copies were collected and used as final data through an online survey of female college students who knew their tendencies through the MBTI test, and the results of the study are as follows. According to the MBTI type, the E-extrovert type showed higher appearance interest than the I-introverted type, and the emotional makeup behavior showed a significant difference among the makeup behavior, but the sympathetic makeup behavior and the social makeup behavior did not show a significant difference. A correlation analysis between appearance interest and makeup behavior by MBTI type showed a statistically significant static (+) correlation in all factors in the order of emotional, sympathetic, and social makeup behavior, and a simple regression analysis was conducted to analyze the reliability of each factor. Based on the results of these studies, it was confirmed that the higher the MBTI propensity, the higher the appearance interest, the more significant the interest among the sub-factors of makeup behavior, and the correlation between appearance interest and makeup behavior. Through this study, we tried to find out the difference in appearance interest and makeup behavior according to the MBTI type of female college students. However, studies on differences in appearance interest and makeup behavior by MBTI type are still insignificant for various classes and subjects, and detailed studies are needed, and this study is expected to be helpful as data to support the revitalization and information establishment of the beauty market in the future.",노은우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108650545

화장품 문화 동향과 특성에 따른 K-뷰티의 맞춤형 수출 증대 방안 : 중국과 동남아를 중심으로,"Recently, the world has shown a great interest in Korean cosmetics under the influence of Hallyu (‘Korean Wave’), and the export volume has significantly increased accordingly. In contrast, the export performances in China and Southeast Asia have sharply decreased, causing a crisis in ‘K-beauty’. Under these circumstances, this study attempted to discuss changes in cosmeceuticals, halal cosmetics, and distribution channels as a way to reinvigorate exports to China and Southeast Asia. Regarding the increase in revenue by penetrating the cosmeceutical markets, products need to be developed which can appeal to young consumers who are highly interested in slowing down the skin aging process; this would also sell with old rich people in China. In the Philippines and Vietnam, on the contrary, it is required to promote differentiated strategies customized for local consumers, such as the development of cosmeceuticals with some medical benefits such as brightening, wrinkle care, and skincare. For this, a technical alliance between cosmetics manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies is essential. To penetrate halal cosmetic markets, it is essential to exclude cosmetics made with the materials strictly prohibited in Islamic culture and develop and distribute halal products that meet the Muslim consumers’ needs. There have been changes in distribution channels across China and Southeast Asia due to a trend shift from conventional distribution structures to online channels, such as the Internet and mobile services. In terms of an entry barrier, online channels have less than conventional offline distribution channels. Hence, it is important to handle both markets by comparing the strengths and weaknesses of both online and offline channels. In general, cultural trends and the characteristics of China and Southeast Asia can have a considerable influence on the export volume of K-beauty.

Collagen provides skin with tensile strength, attachment sites for skin cells, elasticity and hydration, helping maintain mechanical stability or regeneration of skin. The importance of collagen is increasingly recognized as a key source of biomaterials for cosmetics. Commercial collagen has been traditionally extracted mainly from terrestrial mammals such as cattle and pigs. However, recently, marine collagen has attracted much attention, as a mammalian collagen substitute, from biomedical researchers to the cosmetic, food, nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and biomedical industries, especially because of its easy extractability, water-solubility, safety, better chemical and physical durability, and wide availability. Thus, marine collagen is now become a valuable and widely used component in cosmetic formulation due to its significant beneficial effects on human skin. Collagens are usually extracted by acid and pepsin. Its popularity in cosmetology and dermatology is primarily associated with proven ability to enhance skin hydration and elasticity, and exhibit anti-skin aging activity. Moreover, marine collagen also has the potent antioxidant properties, thereby protecting skin cells against oxidative stress caused by free radicals and ultraviolet radiation on the skin.

네일고객의 자아존중감과 외모관심도가 네일 관리행동에 미치는 영향,"This study attempted to find a way to encourage nail care behavior after investigating potential customers’ characteristics to boost the nail care industry in Gyeongsangnam-do. For this, it analyzed differences in nail care behavior, self-esteem and interest in appearance by general characteristics among major nail salon customers from their teens through 60s. In terms of general tendencies, the assumption of normality was met in nail care behavior, self-esteem and appearance satisfaction while nail care behavior was low in ‘those in their 50s or older’, ‘housewives’, ‘extended family’ and ‘large family’. In other words, as the number of family members increased, nail care behavior became less common. Even though there was no statistically significant difference in appearance interest between groups, low nail care behavior was observed.
In other words, self-esteem was low in ‘housewives’. The above results show a possibility that nail care behavior could have a positive effect on self-esteem improvement. They also imply the need for further study of marketing techniques that can prompt housewives to be more voluntary and active in nail care behavior. Since general characteristics create significant differences for progress from high appearance interest to nail care behavior, it is necessary to launch diverse marketing methods such as ‘Buy One, Get One Free (mom + daughter)’ and ‘Housewife Day Special Offer’ to prompt passive groups to be more active in nail care behavior. It’s anticipated that if such potential consumers’ nail care behavior can increase their self-esteem, it could be a positive signal to attract more customers.",홍다검,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106374214
