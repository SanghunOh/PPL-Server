To overcome such limitations, we try to identify the focal points of violent games. This study aims to explore the critical debate about violent games from research result in terms of heading in opposite directions. Furthermore, we analyzed the discourse of the violent game based on catharsis theory and cognitive neoassociation theory. Catharsis theory predicts that 'venting' aggression through exposure to violence will reduce the risk of later aggressive behavior. On the contrary, cognitive neoassociation theory posits that aversive events produce negative affect such as aggression. Several recent studies found little evidence for a relationship between violent games and aggression or violence. Given that aggression is not negative, it is reasonable to study the potential benefits of violent games. Therefore, we suggested several ways to application the violent games based on prior literature.",이혜림,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100158330
A Study on Effective Unreal Interactive Level Implementation Using Stable Diffusion,"This study analyzes and proposes various types of interactive level design implementation methods using Stable Diffusion, a representative system of artificial intelligence visualization in a virtual environment based on Unreal Engine. Stable Diffusion is a representative artificial intelligence visualization system along with Midjourney and is applied to various programs and tools. It is an artificial intelligence visualization system that naturally applies text to image and image to image based on prompt input, as well as body motion changes with simple additional work. . Unreal engine is a representative game engine that has been updated up to 5.2, and 5.1 was used in this study. Unreal Engine is widely used not only for games but also for animation, film CG, architecture, and digital twins. Although it is a game engine, it is a program that is increasingly being used as a content authoring tool other than games. This paper analyzes and proposes a process that can implement an effective interactive level by combining this Stable Diffusion with the Unreal engine. It can be said that artificial intelligence is already being applied to various 2D and 3D contents, leading to actual publishing. This study analyzed the methodology of implementing visual results by effectively integrating the current Unreal Engine and artificial intelligence, and confirmed the foundation for effective construction.",조옥희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635224

Rule-Based Sports Game Framework for Creating Sports Game AI Models: Focusing on Soccer Games,"With the development of Deep Learning (DL), artificial intelligence (AI) models are being created and used in various fields today. Today, with the development of computers and DL algorithms, DL-based AI models can learn a lot of data and find rules by themselves. DeepMind's Alphago shows the possibility of self-determination of game rules and high-level game play with only learning data. Although these various DL algorithms are applied to the game field, there are limits to successful play with only a single AI model in areas where team tactics and individual play coexist, such as sports games. Today, high-quality sports games are readily available. However, game AI researchers may need to receive game code sources or provide test simulators from game companies in order to develop AI models suitable for such high-quality sports games. In order for game AI researchers to develop AI models in the field of active sports games, a test environment that reflects the rules and characteristics of sports games and is easy to access is required. In this paper, we propose a rule-based soccer game framework that can create and test AI models in sports games where team tactics and individual play are important",박형석,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108635223
‘게이미피케이션 PX(플레이어 경험)’을 위한 ‘게임의 인문학’ 연구,"The purpose of this paper is to research on humanities in real games and electronic games for PX(player experience) in gamification. The humanities are academic disciplines that study human culture. The humanities include anthropology, archaeology, history, law, languages, linguistics, literature, philosophy, performing arts. As a well-designed game brings the most powerful and sophisticated user(human) experience, a well-designed gamified application can provide players with the supreme user experience, aka PX(player experience) causing playful behavior and a positive mindset. Recently ‘gamification’ has been broadly accepted as a powerful motivator in various fields and the definition of gamification is expanding to take into consideration, ‘PX(player experience)’ because gamification is the idea of using game-thinking and game mechanics to solve problem and engage players.

게임의 인문융합 스토리텔링 연구,"Play for mankind was evolved into the current era of digital media found in a monitor, so-called ‘game’. Along the current trend of broadly expanding the users of game, the collision is frequently occurred from the issues associated with balance between the proper and reverse function melted in a terminology, “game”. However from the perspective of writer, the existence of game, if it is in an inseparable relation with the mankind, should be fully accepted, rather than be blamed, therefore, our life should be settled down as a cultural trend in the age of “cultural prosperity”. The writer also realizes that game should be settled down as advanced cultural contents as high-edge, comprehensive cultural arts. Therefore, the writer strongly argues that the convergence of engineering and humanities imaginations should be achieved for the unity of knowledge in game industry. Humanistic element is required for the convergence of engineering and humanistic imaginations. In-depth consideration is highly required to find an approach how two afore-mentioned elements, that are totally different each other but in the neighborhood, are to be well-mixed and integrated for story- telling, which is the ultimate motivation for this study. Therefore as a result, a key to dilute the dysfunctional issues associated in game industry was the convergence of humanities; accordingly, this study was to seek a methodology what humanities can be integrated with the components of game, such as character, event and background.",이재홍,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100158317
A Study on Prediction of Balance Patch Standards for MOBA Genre Games (Focused on League of Legends Game),"Today's game industry is in a trend of continuous growth. Game users are experiencing various game genres in this background, and they are also very interested in various activities to increase the winning rate in the game.
Game users collect various information such as win rate and pick rate of game characters they enjoy through internet searches and show a lot of interest in balances of game players. It was judged that it will be helpful for users to utilize various balance patches and establish game strategies based on the standard in the process of exploring various balance-related studies if there is a standard for balancing the game and it is possible to predict the standard. This study focused on establishing the prediction criteria for balance patches, focusing on MOBA genre games where players' balance patches are recognized as important. In particular, it is very meaningful to present a system that can take into account the subsequent patch roadmap according to changes in character's characteristics, developer's patch comments, win rate and pick rate, etc. during the balance patch process. This will make it easier for developers to balance players and help players execute more efficient game strategies by predicting balance patches, transmitting beneficial information strategically to all stakeholders in MOBA genre games. make it easier for developers to balance players and help players execute more efficient game strategies by predicting balance patches, transmitting beneficial information strategically to all stakeholders in MOBA genre games. by predicting balance patches, transmitting beneficial information strategically to all stakeholders in MOBA genre games.",박종관,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108074409

RPG 게임 배경 콘텐츠 제작 과정에 관한 연구,"This study proposed game background content production according to game genre characteristics. Above all, this study classified game background characteristics according to game genre for game background production. Game background intuitively displays a whole game and interfaces with game players. Game background is the player’s space significantly important because it gives interest and immersion of the game to the player. This study analyzed Dungeon background content production for online game PRG genre. For production of Dungeon game background contents, it is necessary to consider periodic, cultural, historical, artificial, virtual, environmental elements including periodic backgrounds and fantasy elements as background environment set elements. And it is necessary to collect related materials, establish content images, and actualize them. After completing establishment and actualization, it is necessary to finish background work by producing 3D contents based on the original picture. This study produced 2D Dungeon background contents with Photoshop and 3D with MAX, resulting in satisfactory production. From the results of analyzing Dungeon game background contents, it was found that most of content production was conducted under dark and fantasy tones with the sense of medieval weights.

게임 기획에서의 조작적 조건화 분석 가이드라인,"Operant conditioning has been acknowledged as a powerful force in game design. There have been many arguments that reinforcement is a too powerful tool of operant conditioning that they compromise the will of the player. Even though Skinner wrote a book of “The behavior of organisms: an experimental analysis”in 1938, operant conditioning is still a misunderstood concept especially in the game design domain. Operant conditioning exists whether or not designers are aware of it. Many people seem to assume that there are no operant conditioning in a game unless they are explicitly added in the game design. Any pattern in how that reward is provided is an operational conditioning of the sort described by behavioral psychology. There has been little research on how to properly make use of the operant conditioning to analyze and enhance game play experience. When designers make efforts to implement a system to reinforce game players’particular behavior, they have to figure out how to implement operant conditioning by themselves. This often results in mis-uses of operant conditioning or too much uses of reinforcement in game design. Therefore, in this paper, we presents an operant conditioning analysis guideline that can be used to make game designs better. We showed how the operant conditioning could reinforce the game play and improve game designs using the guideline. The future goal of this research is to reveal reinforcement mechanism and to use it for educational or serious game design.",최재원,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100324923
