We extract mel spectrogram, log mel spectrogram, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), and delta MFCC from the UrbanSound8K dataset, which is widely used in environmental sound classification studies. Then we scale the data to 3 distributions. Using the data, we test four CNNs, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 networks for performance assessment according to the audio features and scaling. The highest recognition rate is achieved when using the unscaled log mel spectrum as the audio features. Although this result is not appropriate for all audio recognition problems but is useful for classifying the environmental sounds included in the Urbansound8K.",오원근,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106882965
하이브리드형 초음파 스피커 개발,"Directional ultrasonic speakers that are used to hear sound only in a specific area have been continuously researched on various improvements in terms of sound quality and cost compared to general speakers. In this paper, we propose a DSP based hybrid-type ultrasonic speaker that can be heard at the same time as a general speaker in order to compensate for the sound in the low-band range, considering that it is difficult to hear the low-band sound below 500 Hz due to the sensor characteristics of the ultrasonic speaker. In the case of the system that is implemented by simply connecting a general speaker and an ultrasonic speaker, there are issues of high cost and difficulties of control as two amplifiers are used to playback ultrasonic and general sound sources. In addition, sound quality deteriorates due to the difference in playback time between ultrasonic and general sound sources. In order to improve issues of cost, control and sound quality, we developed hybrid-type ultrasonic speaker with a DSP based amplifier that can simultaneously playback by synchronizing the general sound source with the regenerated ultrasonic sound source, in addition to implement the existing CODEC functions such as Dynamic Range Control (DRC) and Equalizer (EQ).",이형상,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107458559
시뮬레이션과 청감실험을 통한 공연장 형태별 음향성능 비교분석,"In this study, the acoustic performance was analyzed by architectural shapes of the hall. There are four architectural shapes of halls. They are rectangular, horseshoe, surround, and fan-shape. Eight acoustic parameters were used to determine the acoustic performance. These are RT60, EDT, C80, BQI, LF, Gmid, G125 and ITDG.
First, measurement data of famous concert halls around the world were analyzed. The correlation coefficient R was obtained by regression analysis of the relationship between the subjective ranking of the halls and the acoustic parameters. It was found that BQI, G, and ITDG have higher correlation coefficients R. Also the average of acoustic parameters for each architectural shape were obtained. The total acoustic performance for each shape was calculated by using the correlation coefficient R as a weight for each acoustic parameters. As a result, rectangular halls and horseshoe halls showed good acoustical performances. Second, 3D models of each architectural shape were created and acoustic simulation had been performed. The simulation was performed by creating 3D models of each four shapes of concert halls with the same volume and sound absorption coefficient. Listening test was carried out using the sound source which is created from impulse responses of 3D model. As a result, rectangular hall and horseshoe hall showed the best performance however surround hall and fan-shaped hall showed relatively poor performance.",강찬우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108610245
방음판의 흡음률 측정방법 제안을 위한 기초 연구,"Sound barrier walls are the most basic way to cope with noise problems in urban residential environments. The most important acoustic function of sound insulation board is represented by sound transmission loss and sound absorption coefficient. However, Korea has not yet established a standard for measuring the sound absorption rate of sound insulation boards. In addition, even in the European standard, where the overall acoustic standard of soundproofing boards has already been established, the sound absorption rate is applied only to the standard for measuring the sound absorption rate of general building finishing materials, and a separate measurement method considering the characteristics of soundproof walls and soundproofing boards is not presented. The sound absorption coefficient should be evaluated by summing up the energy absorbed into the material as well as the energy transmitted through the material, but the current European standard has a problem in that the transmitted sound energy is not taken into account. In this paper, we reviewed the sound absorption coefficient measurement standards of sound insulation boards currently being presented, and verified the difference between the results and the new measurement method considering transmission sound for sound insulation boards actually used in Korea.",오양기,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108547095
한국어 단모음 8개에 대한 음향분석 - F1/F2 모음공간에서의 음향변수를 중심으로 -,"This paper describes the acoustic characteristics of 8 Korean monophthongs. Two acoustic variables were newly manipulated the distance between Fl and F2 (Δ［F2-Fl］). which might be of help for the judgement of the vowel backness. and Euclidian distance between two vowels. ［에］ & ［애］ were observed to be merged in both male vowel space and the female's. respectively.

In case of Fl, which concerns the vowel height. the scope of the females' was 1.36 times longer than that of the males' Regarding F2, which is related to the vowel backness. the females used a space 1.29 times longer than the males. The observation of Euclidian distance between the basic 3 vowels (이. 아. 우) showed that the females have longer distance than the males: ［이-아］ 1.25 times, ［아-우］ 1.45 times, and ［이-우］ 1.35 times. respectively.",성철재,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101071381
잡음에 강한 음성 인식에서 SNR 기준 함수를 사용한 가우시안 함수 변형 및 결정에 관한 연구,"In case of spectral subtraction for noise robust speech recognition system, this method often makes loss of speech signal. In this study, we propose a method that variation and determination of Gaussian function at semi-continuous HMM(Hidden Markov Model) is made on the basis of SNR criteria function, in which SNR means signal to noise ratio between estimation noise and subtracted signal per frame. For proving effectiveness of this method, we show the estimation error to be related with the magnitude of estimated noise through signal waveform. For this reason, Gaussian function is varied and determined by SNR. When we test recognition rate by computer simulation under the noise environment of driving car over the speed of 80㎞/h, the proposed Gaussian decision method by SNR turns out to get more improved recognition rate compared with the frequency subtracted and non-subtracted cases.",전선도,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101070951

초음파 기반 혈뇌장벽 개방에 관한 최신 임상시험 연구 현황,"Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) is the brain protecting system blocking the inflow of harmful substances into brain parenchyma from brain blood vessel. However, the BBB has a negative effect on the treatment of various brain diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia or brain tumors because it also prevents drug delivery into brain parenchyma. To overcome this problem, a brain drug delivery technique using Focused Ultrasound (FUS) which allows BBB to be temporarily opened by inducing the acoustic cavitation effect of microbubbles has been developed. Thus far, various studies using the FUS technique has been conducted to improve drug delivery efficiency, and therefore, this paper discusses recently developed drug delivery technologies using the FUS-induced BBB opening.",박주영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108280754
사운드워킹을 통한 청주시 도심지역 음풍경 조사,"The present study investigated the sounds at 13 points in the four districts in Cheongju including commercial district, historic district, urban walking district and university campus in order to realize the soundscape of the city. In order to this, questionnaire survey was conducted to 65 citizens and 5 acoustic experts on sites to find both sound loudness and annoyance of each district. At the same time, information about loud, unpleasant, preferred and representative sound of each district were acquired by selecting three from 35 sounds which consist of natural, artificial and machinery sounds. As a result, it was found that there is a very close correlation between sound loudness and annoyance. Through the analysis of sounds at each district, it was revealed that machinery sounds dominate in commercial area as figure sound, It was also shown that artificial and natural sounds dominate in historic area, artificial sounds in both urban area and university campus respectively. Laboratory listening tests were undertaken to 20 people using recorded sounds and video captured on site. The results denote that machinery and artificial sounds are regarded as most loud, machinery sounds as most unpleasant, natural and artificial sounds as most pleasant which shows similar tendency of on-site evaluation.",조아현,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107922866
양이형 음성 음질개선 시스템을 위한 온라인 잡음 상관도 추정 알고리즘,"In this paper, an on-line noise coherence estimation algorithm for binaural speech enhancement system is proposed. A number of noise Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation algorithms based on the noise coherence between two microphones have been proposed to improve the speech enhancement performance. In the conventional algorithms, the noise coherence was characterized using a real-valued analytic model. However, unlike the analytic model, the noise coherence between the two microphones is time-varying in real environments. Thus, in this paper, the noise coherence is updated in accordance with the variation of the acoustic environment to track the realistic noise coherence. The noise coherence can be updated only during the absence of speech, and the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the conventional algorithms based on the analytic model.",지유나,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102492405
폴리비닐알코올 젤의 집속초음파에 의한 온도분포 변화,"In order to obtain basic information for using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) gel as a tissue mimicking phantom for temperature visualization, the temperature change characteristics due to the focused ultrasound were examined for different concentration of PVA. To obtain the basic acoustic characteristics, the speed of sound, the attenuation coefficient, and the density depending on the PVA concentration were measured, and the thermodynamic characteristics, such as thermal conductivity and heat capacity, were measured. The range of temperature rising in the vicinity of the focal point due to the focused ultrasound was observed using a thermochromic film that changes color at 30 degree or more, and the discolored area was obtained by image processing of the recorded image. As the concentration of PVA increases in the given range of 2 wt% ~ 16 wt%, the area that rises above 30 degree inside the gel increases linearly. It is confirmed that the discolored area increases as the power applied to the focused ultrasonic transducer increases. These results showed good agreement with the simulation results using the finite element method.",김정순,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107142723
콘서트홀에서 무대음향에 대한 확산체의 영향,"The effect of diffusers on Early Stage Support (ST1) in a concert hall was investigated at 8 positions in a 1:25 stage scale model. Experiments were carried out when the stage floor was covered with and without absorption cloth to investigate the effect of stage floor reflection (absorption coefficient - 0.6 at 500Hz). To find out the effect of stage wall. three types of wall diffusers were used. As a result. absorption cloth on stage floor reduced the ST1 values at high frequency. but the average value of ST1 was not changed. Three types of stage wall diffusers were revealed as unaffecting. but it was observed that the ST1 values varied to positions of stage. The ST1 values were evenly distributed when hemisphere diffusers were used. Therefore. the use of floor absorption did not have much effect on the ST1 values, and the diffusers had some effect on the distribution of the ST1 values.",이충화,2005,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101071449

인간의 청각 특성을 이용한 입체음향의 방향감 개선,"The Head Related Transfer Function (HRTF) means a process related to acoustic transmission from 3d space to the listener's ear. In other words, it contains the information that human can perceive locations of sound sources. So, we make virtual 3d sound using HRTF, despite it doesn't actually exist. But, it can deteriorate some three-dimensional effect by the confusion between front and back directions due to the non-individual HRTF depending on each listener. In this paper, we proposed the new algorithm to reduce the confusion of sound image localization using human's acoustic characteristics. The frequency spectrum and global masking threshold of 3d sounds using HRTF are used to calculate the psychoacoustical differences among each directions. And perceptible cues in each critical band are boosted to create effective 3d sound.

소리의 공간 제어를 위한 구형 다채널 스피커 어레이 설계,"The objective of this paper is to design multichannel spherical loudspeaker array by considering various positioning methods such as Gaussian grid, Lebedev grid and packing method. For the spatial sound manipulation, which is to make desired sound field by controling multiple sound sources, the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral states that sound fields can be reproduced in terms of infinite control sources on the integral surface. But since we cannot control infinite number of sources for the implementation, we have to allocate finite number of sound sources which can approximately act as infinite number of sources. To manipulate sound field inside of a sphere (which is typical example of three dimensional array) by controlling sound sources on the surface, three methods of allocating sound sources, which are Gaussian grid, Lebedev grid and packing method, are reviewed.

This formulation, derived for arbitrary sources, is similar in form to the Rayleigh's formula for planar sources. Because the surface pressure field is expressed explicitly as a surface integral of the surface velocity, which can be implemented numerically using standard Gaussian quadratures, there is no need to use BEM to solve a set of simultaneous equations for the surface pressure at the discretized nodes. Furthermore the non-uniqueness problem inherent in methods based on Helmholtz integral equation is avoided.

The simulation results show that the bit error rate of the proposed method is better performance than that of the conventional CSS modulation method by about 3.5 dB to 8 dB.

For 38, 120, and 200 kHz frequencies, target strength equations are expressed as a function of fish length：TS/sub 38kHz/=20 log/sub 1o(l)/-66.41, TS/sub 120kHz/＝20 log/sub 1o(1)/-71.80, and TS/sub 200kHz/＝20 log/sub 1o(1)/-73.94.
