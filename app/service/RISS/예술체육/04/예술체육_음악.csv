As for the research method, 10 excellent music generators recommended by artificial intelligence music generator experts were selected, their characteristics were analyzed, and musical knowledge and functions required for the use of artificial intelligence music generators were analyzed.functions required for the use of artificial intelligence music generators were systematized. In addition, the characteristics of artificial intelligence music generators were compared and analyzed by arranging the musical knowledge, functions, and goals presented in the creative area of the 2022 revised music curriculum. The conclusions drawn from this study are as follows. First, the grounds for using artificial intelligence music generators are variously presented in the creative area of the 2022 revised music curriculum. Second, in order to utilize the artificial intelligence music generator, basic knowledge about genre, mood, and music elements is basically required. Third, the learning method of students should consider a method similar to the artificial neural network learning method learned by the artificial intelligence music generator. Fourth, with the advent of artificial intelligence music generators, the learning method for music creation will change, and it is necessary to fundamentally reorganize the curriculum accordingly. Fifth, the music creation curriculum using artificial intelligence music generators should have a structure that can foster self-direction or imagination that music education currently pursues.",박은비,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108673484
자폐범주성장애 아동의 또래 간 상호작용 촉진을 위한 동기화 기반 그룹 음악치료 사례,"This case study examined the effects of synchronization-based group music therapy for improving peer interaction of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The participants were five children between the ages of 6 and 10 with ASD. A total of eight 30-minute music therapy sessions were conducted two times a week. During sessions, target behaviors (i.e., engagement in joint action, synchronized movements, eye contact, and initiation of social interaction) were observed and analyzed. Also, the PIPPS-P was completed by parents to identify behavioral changes in real-life environments from pretest to posttest. Following the intervention, all of the participants showed increases in synchronized movements with peers and attempts to initiate social interaction. In addition, parents rated their children’s play behavior as being improved in their everyday living environment. These results support that synchronous movements between children with ASD, which were facilitated with rhythmic cueing, led to enhanced engagement in joint action. Considering that those movements are the basis for further social skills (e.g., play behavior), this study also indicates that synchronization-based group music therapy could be an effective therapeutic approach for improving the peer interaction of this population.",김지윤,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106888317

조현병 환자 대상음악중재에 대한 체계적 고찰,"The purpose of this study was to systematically review music intervention studies for patients with schizophrenia. The researcher searched nine electronic databases for clinical trials published since 2000, using combinations of keyword related to schizophrenia and music interventions. The initial search identified 272 studies, and fifteen studies were selected by reviewing the titles, abstracts and full articles, In addition, three articles were added by examining other review articles. Thus, a total of 18 articles were analyzed in terms of their general and intervention characteristics, and the PEDro scale was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. The results demonstrated that, due to the lack of randomization and blinding, the methodological qualities of the studies with high quality music interventions were often rated low. Eight Music interventions conducted by qualified music therapists included active music-making, therapeutic relationship, and supervision systems for improving intervention quality.

그룹 랩만들기의 치료적 적용: 경도지적장애 청소년의 의사소통기술 향상 사례,"This study aimed to develop a group rap making program and examine its applicability to improve communication skills of adolescents with mild intellectual disabilities (ID). Three adolescents with ID participated in a total of six 50-minute group sessions over 4 weeks. The group rap making program included three stages: understanding the context of communication, learning how to communicate with others, and applying the communicative behaviors in a group setting. To examine changes in the participants’ communication skills, the rap lyrics constructed by participants were analyzed and communicative behaviors were observed during sessions and analyzed in terms of asking questions and providing information to others. Also, a social communication skills checklist was rated by the participant’s caregivers. The analysis of rap lyrics showed that the expressions included in the rap were diversified as the session proceeded. Changes in observed behaviors supported that participants became to engage in communication with others more actively in order to complete the group rap. While the social communication skills checklist tended to increase, there was a difference in degree of change depending on the level of language communication skills. These results indicate that a group rap making can be an effective option for these adolescents to learn how to communicate with their peers, which presents implications for how rap making can be used for therapeutic purpose with more diversified population.",김은하,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107935985

음악의 화음 전개 수준에 따른 감상자의 정서 지각 연구,"The purpose of this study was to compare participants’ perceived emotion following harmonic changes in music. In this study, 144 participants, aged 19 to 29 years, listened to music online that included low to high harmonic progression in tonal music (major-minor). After listening to each piece of music, participants were asked to rate 4 items using a 7-point Likert scale: emotional potency, arousal, degree to which the harmony impacted the listener’s emotions, and listener’s preference for the music. There were significant differences between each of the four items upon the level of harmonic progression. When the participants were divided into two groups (i.e., those with a background in music and those with no background in music), there was a significant difference between the groups in terms of emotional potency, but there was no significant interaction effect. This study confirmed that various emotional responses in listeners can be induced by controlling the exogenous variables in musical excerpts. Based on this, it is expected that the harmonic progression level can be provided to the client to be used as an effective therapeutic tool in music therapy intervention.",유해인,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108151746

모방과 창의성 사이의 테크놀로지: 코프(D. Cope)의 초기 AI 작곡 모델 에미(Emmy) 연구,"AI(Artificial Intelligence) has made a significant impact on human life, and various AI composition models are now active in the field of music. What kind of aesthetic value does music created by AI? Starting from this critical question, this thesis examines David Cope's (b. 1941) early AI composition model called 'Emmy'.
Cope developed the Emmy in 1981 while attempting ""Experiments in Musical Intelligence."" Emmy inputs the works of major composers in Western music history, analyzes each element of original music, discovers stylistic signatures through pattern matching, and recombines them through ATN(Argumented Transition Network) to create her own music. Emmy composed symphonies, piano sonatas, chorales, string quartets, and operas, which were hotly debated and criticized as ""no heart,"" ""soulless,"" and ""cheap imitation"" aroused all.
However, as a result of examining the aesthetic discussion according to Emmy's creative process and acceptance, many prejudices intervened in the evaluation of Emmy's music. This thesis claims that Emmy's work is not a simple imitation of existing music, but implies its own aesthetic value. In other words, it is necessary to newly define the concept of creativity corresponding to the changes in music caused by the intervention of technology, to understand and evaluate the creative activities of AI more appropriately. Thus, we need a new aesthetic perspective that recognizes itself to comprehend the impact of AI on the art of music.",오희숙,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108620597

쇼팽의 음악에서 나타나는 반음 관계 전조의 형식적 기능,"This paper examines Chopin’s chromatic tonality by focusing on his use of semitonal relationships. I argue that recognizing Chopin’s delicate handling of tonal focus offers analysts a vantage point for interpreting semitonal relationships in formal designs. This paper explores formal functions of two types of semitonal modulations: 1) those that involve a cadential progression; and 2) those that blur formal boundaries. First, a semitonal shift becomes an effective way to expand and dramatize the resolution of tension or to weaken the movement’s sense of closure, as illustrated in the last moments of the Waltz in Ab Major, Op. 42, the Fantasy Op. 49, and the first movement of the Bb-Minor Sonata, Op. 35. Second, there are cases where a semitonal modulation blurs formal boundaries. In the Mazurka in D Major, Op. 33, No. 2, the Mazurka in C Minor, Op. 56, No. 3, and the Ballade in F Minor, Op. 52, a dividing point between the two sections is disguised by being located in the middle of the semitonal modulatory process.",정희원,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A103588717

스트리밍 시대 미디어를 통한 한국인의 음악청취행태 분석,"In South Korea, people listening to music through streaming service apps on their smartphones is increasing. According to diffusion of innovations theory, there should be differences in gender, age, education, and income among those who adopt this new technology early. This study investigates the differences in music listening behavior by these demographic attributes during the period of popularization of the new technology of streaming through smartphones, For this purpose, the Media Panel Diary data provided by Korea Information Society Development Institute was analyzed. Analyzing data from 2011 to 2022, some interesting changes during this period were found. Overall, music listening rates were found to increase in all gender, age, education, and income attributes. Within each demographic, women were more likely to use smartphones and streaming than men. In the early 2010s, younger people listened to more music, but by 2020, teenagers listened to less music than 20s, and 30s listened to less music than 40s and 50s. The higher the education level, the higher the music listening rate. There was little difference in music listening by income level. The difference between listening to music on smartphones and streaming also showed little difference by income level. Smartphones and streaming have different properties as media, but there is little difference as media used for listening music. While there are some limitations and unsatisfactory parts in this article, the significance of this study is that it tracked changes in music listening behavior as the media environment has changed since 2011, and makes meaningful findings across demographic attributes.",박재록,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108620598

It is even now controversial whether or not Die Zauberfloete is a Masonic opera. A lot of Mozart manias have questions in mind such as how Mozart became a freemason and why the libretto of Die Zauberfloete was suddenly changed. Such questions are investigated in this paper. We examined first the circumstances in which Mozart participated in the circle of Masonry and the previous works by Mozart for the lodge of freemason prior to Die Zauberfloete. Later it is analyzed whether or not Schikaneder wrote the whole libretto of Magic flute. Although it is believed that Schikaneder was the author of its libretto, our bold argument partly favors the radical suggestion that the most part of the libretto was written by Giesecke. It means that Giesecke was at least responsible for the libretto of ActⅡ. Lastly, we explored the masonic elements appeared in the libretto and the music of Die Zauberfloete.

난임 여성의 정서조절기술 향상을 위한 심상 중심 음악감상 프로그램 개발,"The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an imagery-focused music listening program for improving emotion regulation among infertile women. For the program development in this study, the literature on emotional issues and coping strategy of infertile women was analyzed to establish theoretical foundation; and the literature on Supportive Music and Imagery (SMI) was analyzed to identify intervention components. Based on the established theoretical framework, the program was developed and finalized after evaluation of validity by four SIM professionals. The developed program was found to systematically target changes in emotions in the step-wise process of discovery, reinforcement, and affirmation of positive emotional resources. The list of music for future use was also identified and presented after systematic analysis of musical features in relation to valence and arousal of emotions. The imagery-focused music listening program was an initial approach to infertile women with SMI, which indicates the possibility of extended application for broadened clinical population.",노윤희,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107147925
동서양 음악미학 고찰을 통한 한국음악의 정체성 연구(1),"It is not an easy task to answer the question, How can we define Korean music in the whirl of 21th-century globalization? For the first stage to define the identity of Korean Music in the 21th century, the author chose the method of comparison between music aesthetics of Eastern and that of Western. In order to diagnose the present situation, the author thinks that it would be helpful to go back to the roots of the musical thoughts of both cultures.
In the part of Eastern music aesthetics, the author reviewed the Confucianism first among the various traditional thoughts in the history of Korean music. Yueh Chi (樂記) or the Book of music, Especially which was originally contained in Li Chi (禮記), was chosen as the representative text which contained the fundamental musical thoughts of Confucianism. On the other hand, in the part of Western music aesthetics, various writings of the representative philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle were consulted. Although there was no actual interaction between Ancient Greece and China, the striking similarities of both musical thoughts attracted the author and led to investigate the reason why ancient people in both cultures viewed music in similar ways. In this paper, three common aspects of musical thoughts in both cultures were chosen, i. e. cosmological, moral (educational) and political aspects.
The present Korean music consists of various musics from different historical backgrounds and viewpoints. If we would find the common basis for various musics by investigating the both roots of Eastern and Western musical thoughts, we could make some positive steps forward to understand the identity of Korean music. The author hopes that such trial could contribute to set the place and direction of Korean music in the map of the world music. However, keeping in mind that it could not be done within a short period and with one trial, the author will expand and develop this research into broad areas and various methods.",이경희,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40100476

Sense of self-worth was defined as trust and respect for the self as evidenced by understanding of one’s individuality and uniqueness. Participants in the study were two adults in need of help with psychological challenges arising from low self-worth. Each of them participated in SMI sessions once a week, for a total of 6 weeks. Participants’ statements on the imagery drawn by them during SMI sessions were analyzed in relation to components of the sense of self-worth. The results of this study showed that SMI sessions helped both clients recognize their internal resources and gaining insight into the value of their internal resources increased their evaluation of their own self-worth. Specific factors of SMI sessions that impacted the clients’ self-worth and suggestions for future studies are also discussed.",박지은,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107147948
윤이상의 대관현악곡 「예악(Re´ak)」 (1966),"Diese Studie analysiert das representative Werk Isang Yuns fuer grosses Orchester: 「Reak」(1966). Die Analyse verbindet die Struktur-Analyse mit der Hoeranalyse der Klanggestalt. Als charakteristisch fuer die Klanggestalt des Stueckes werden folgende Merkmale herausgestellt: der Klang fliesst still und dynamisch, monistisch und heterophon entlang einer Wand-Flaeche in eine Richtung, und hat trotz aller heterophonen Zuege einen ganzheitlichen Charakter. Bei diesem wird stets eine fuer Yun eigentuemliche Spannung geladen.
Das zweite Kapitel untersucht die Gestaltungsweisen der je eine Klanggruppe bildenden Instrumentengruppen. finsichtlich der musikalischen Semantlk sind die Konstellationen der Instrumentengruppen bzw. Klangfamilien von wichtiger Bedeutung. Im Laufe des Stueckes veraendem sich d e Klang gestaltender Instrumentengruppe gleichsam vom Kollekven zum Individuellen. Dies verursacht einen Funktionswandel der Einzelinstnunentengruppen: der Wandlungsprozess der koreanischen Mehrklangpeitsche Pakgruppe und Harfengruppe ist hierbei bedeutsam .
Das naechste Kapitel analysiert am Beispiel des dntten Teils die bei 「Reak」vollendete Hauptklangtechnik. Das den Hauptklang konstruierende Tonbuendel fis3-gis-(cis2-e)-h bei der Floetengruppe, und h-cis-fis bei der Trompetengruppe bestehen aus einem Bruchteil des meldschen h-Moll-Tonleiter, so dass der Ton h den Charakter eines tonalen Zentnuns hat. Hinsichtlich des klanglichen Merkmals dieses Teils laesst sich es nicht verkennen, dass Yun versucht, den Charakteristik der koreanischen Musikelemente nicht allein n i t der westeuropaischen atonalen Technik zu vermitteln, sondem auch vermittels einer dramatischen Spannung mit der Eigenarten der musikahschen Romantik. Die Kraft des Gesamtklanges, die den Klangfuss dieses Stueckes traegt, liegt in der dynamischen Funktion der Hauptklaenge, die das Klangmaterial veraenderen und erweitem.
Weiter wird das Verhaeltnis der Hauptklangkomposition Isang Yuns zur Klangflaechenkomposition Gyorgy Ligetis untersucht. Waehrend bei Ligeti die Einzeltoene nicht als solche wahrgenommen werden, haben Einzeltoene bei Yun eine gestaltbare Bedeutung und beanspruchen eine entsprechende Wahrnehmungsweise. Besonders kennzeichnend 1st die Ausdrucksgeste, mit sich die Hauptklaenge stets praesentieren. Ekachtenswert ist, dass solche Charakteristka normalerweise am Ende einer Phrase bzw. Abschnittes oder eines noch groesseren Teils vorkommen. Das Kemelement der Spannung, das dialektische Zuege und somit Widerspruch beinhaltet, liegt im Konfikt zwischen den Geste und Flaeche, also dem Klangfluss und Gegenstaendhchkeit, der bei der Verknuepfung mit der Klangflaechenkomposition verursacht wird.
Das letzte Kapitel untemimmt eine kultursoziologische Interpretation ueber 「Reak」, der die vorangegangene Hoer-Analyse wie aesthetische Betrachtung zugrundeliegen. Zwei Bedeutungen konnten dem Stueck zugeschneben werden: zum einen reflektiert sich in Reak~ die Einwanderergesellschaft der aussereuropaeischen Voelker in der westeuropiaschen Gesellschaft, zum anderen widerspiegelt sich die Aussenseite des Werksystems den Veraendemgsprozess der traditionellen koreanischen Musiktradition. Folglich hat die Klangsprache Yuns ein doppeltes Spannungsverhaeltnis gegenueber der koreanischen wie der westeuropaischen Musiktradition. Der verrnittels der Hauptklangtechruk konstruierende endlose Klangfluss des 「Reak」-Stueckes, dessen eigene Struktur eine Klangflaeche bildet, kontrapunktiert scheinbar die Kollektiv-Emotion der koreanischen Volksgruppe.",윤신향,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40100470
