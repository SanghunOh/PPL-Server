Based on the analysis of the creative domain of the 2022 revised music curriculum, this study summarizes the challenges for creative education in Korean music as follows.
First, with the addition of the creative domain in the 2022 revised music curriculum, which emphasized the significance of creative education, the task was set as ‘emphasizing the educational significance through the establishment of goals for Korean music creative education. In this context, two objectives were proposed: ‘cultivating musical thinking through Korean music creative education’ and ‘enhancing the capacity as composers capable of expressing the improvisational nature of Korean music.’ Second, as Korean music elements were not explicitly stated in the achievement standards, and instead, comprehensive criteria related to musical elements were provided in the 2022 revised music curriculum, the task was set as ‘materializing Korean music creative activities related to musical elements.’ Third, in light of the explicit inclusion of achievement standards pertaining to notation and the emphasis on notation education in the creative area of the 2022 revised music curriculum, ‘systematizing notation education for Korean music creation’ was set as a task.
This study has the significance of presenting the challenges and perspectives of Korean music creative education for the implementation of the 2022 revised music curriculum, In order to ensure that the value of Korean music as a source of creative inspiration continues to be utilized in the changing currents of time and that Korean music creative education fulfills its role in reaching the goals of music education, related discussions should be more advanced.",김민하,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732031
트로트의 장르적 정체와 현 단계 트로트의 위상,"Trot is the most representative sub genre of Korean popular songs, which has been together since the beginning of Korean popular songs. It has shared the joys and sorrows of the common people for a long time in the extreme evaluations of ‘Japanese style songs (倭色歌謠)’ and ‘Korean traditional songs’, ‘lamentation’ and ‘frivolity’. In this study, the identity of the trot as a popular music genre and the current cultural status of trot will be examined. To reach this end, I will examine the way trot was called when it was fixed as a genre, and the process of accumulating genre traditions. Furthermore, this study will measure the potential of trot as a community culture through the way trot exists here and now. It is not irrelevant to the process of finding the answer to the fundamental question of ‘What is the trot’. In fact, it is really difficult to give a perspicuous answer to the question of ‘What is the trot?’. The reason is that trot exists as an aspect of a cultural phenomenon beyond a matter of musical style. In addition, it is inevitable to take into account that recognizing a specific work as trot is often understood by its unique mood or atmosphere rather than its musical style. Focusing on this point, this study paid attention to the method of implementing the genre of trot that deals with 'emotion', and revealed that the genre tradition of trot is concentrated on the overexposure of emotion and the pose for it. The overexposure of emotions has the effect of inducing the audience to thoroughly immerse themselves in and identify with the target rather than keeping a distance from it. In the field where Trot is actually performed, the solidarity of emotions among the audience is symbolically represented through focusing on the moment of sharing emotions and spreading empathy rather than the singer's performance. Trot can be said to function as a community songs and sympathetic field that mediates collective emotion and practice. The method of implementing this genre can be said to be effective in reexamining the potential of trot as a community songs now that the dissolution and reconstruction of the community that is the basis of folk songs is constantly going on.",박애경,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108398443
문화 향유를 위한 학교 음악교육에서의 문화유산교육 방향 탐색,"This study aims to propose the direction of teaching cultural heritages at the music class in schools following the perspective that cultural heritage education should lead to ‘cultural enjoyment’. In this study, the definition of cultural enjoyment that can be applied in school education is considered as ‘the intellectual, emotional, practical process and its results that an individual actively seeks to understand and experience culture,’ and three attributes of ‘activity, positive sentiment, and participation’ are presented as those of cultural enjoyment.
As a result of analyzing the current status and problems of cultural heritage education in schools, the following problems were identified: ‘curriculum standards centered on research and presentation,’ ‘curriculum standards limited to appreciation and value recognition,’ ‘textbook contents biased towards data presentation and information delivery,’ and ‘inadequate provision of musical experiences for learning cultural heritages.’ To solve such problems and increase the possibility of achieving the goal of 'enjoying culture' in school education, we propose three aspects in cultural heritage education: establishing goals for cultural heritage education that promote the development of 'subjectivity in creating'; setting up a content framework for cultural heritage education centered on 'enjoyment'; and enhancing the ability to enjoy culture based on participatory cultural heritage learning.
The significance of this study is to raise the need for cultural heritage education in schools to move in the direction of enhancing learners' ability to enjoy culture, and to discuss the direction for this. To solve the problems raised in this study, it is important to achieve social consensus on cultural heritage, revise national education curricula, develop music textbooks, and cooperate with institutions related to cultural heritage education.",김민하,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579823
메이키 메이키(Makey Makey)를 활용한 대취타 교수ㆍ학습 방안 연구,"The Ministry of Education announced the 2022 revised curriculum, emphasizing the transition to education that can foster the ability to respond to uncertainties in future changes. In anticipation of changes that schools will encounter in establishing teaching, learning, and assessment systems aligned with the digital and AI educational landscape, the revised curriculum contains content urging for the changes of the future educational environment, called the era of digital transformation. In response to this, the researcher has designed Daechwita lessons that can develop digital tools and computational thinking through interdisciplinary learning across subject. The Music and Practical subjects were linked, and teaching-learning contents were structured based on the content framework and achievement standards of the 2022 revised curriculum. After creating code with block coding, students can explore Daechwita instruments by using the Makey Makey board as a touch pad for sound playback. And they crafted a creative sound-playback device by connecting conductors and engaged in ensemble performances. This can open up various possibilities in the creative area of the 2022 revised music curriculum and provide students with an opportunity to engage in activities centered around the sound of Korean traditional instruments. Through this study, it is hoped that new possibilities for Korean traditional music classes will emerge during this transition to digital education, and various class cases related to this will come to light.",민병선,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732024
영남 농악과 사물놀이의 별달거리를 활용한 초등 타악 교육 방안,"""Byeoldalgeori"" is a rearranged piece based on Yeongnam nongak . Not only Jinju-Samcheonpo nongak's ""Byeolgutnori"", which is directly mentioned as the background of the creation of ""Byeoldalgeori"", but also Geumneung Bitnae nongak's ""Panan dadeuraegi (sorigut)"" are closely related to ""Byeoldalgeori"". This study compares and analyzes the musical composition and characteristics between the three musical pieces and examines musical expressions of the percussions shown in nongak (also called pungmul; percussion ensemble music) and samulnori (a modernized version of pungmul). Thus, it aims to find educational plans that can be used for elementary students to learn traditional percussions.
In order to examine the musical composition and characteristics of samulnori and nongak, this study divides the entire piece into instrumental and vocal elements to explore musical characteristics and effects. In addition, it grasps the structure of the jangdan (rhythmic patterns) by identifying it with sobak (lit. small beat; subdivided beat) and bak (beat) according to the rhythmic structure, and analyzes phrases and whole pieces based on the rhythmic type.
As a result, the musical composition and characteristics are derived as follows.
First of all, both nongak and samulnori include vocal and instrumental elements, which are arranged in a balanced way, based on hwimori jangdan (four beats with duple subdivisions). Vocal elements include lines, slogans, and rhymes, each of which plays a role of giving signals, praying for wishes, and conveying daily situations, respectively, enriching the contents of the music. The rhythm patterns of hwimori jangdan can be seen as variations, and they form a musical phrases such as a type of one jangdan (one jangdan periodically), a type of dual jangdans (two contrasting jangdans periodically), and a stereotyped type (the fixed number of jangdans with the fixed rhythmic patterns and order periodically). The style ofcall and response and the style according to hanbae (tempo) in an entire piece are found.
This study proposes an educational plan using the musical expressions of Korean traditional percussion music. First, in terms of vocal elements, learners can express various contents in slogans, and rhymes to match hwimori jangdan. Second, in terms of instrumental elements, they can learn various rhythm patterns of hwimori jangdan and then make various musical phrases combining them in a new way.
Third, they can properly arrange vocal and instrumental elements and introduce the style of call and response to make the entire piece well-structured. Lastly, they can properly utilize the function of conventional hwimori jangdan to realize the form according to hanbae in the entire piece",박희윤,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579827
성인국악교육 연구성과 분석을 통한 평생국악교육 연구사 고찰,"This research scrutinizes academic papers and thesis discussing Korean traditional music education specifically targeting adults, and sees life long gugak education from the perspective of its research history. The writings on adult gugak education deal with various programs like event, music therapy, culture welfare, college affiliated coursework, online learning, and stage participatory trainings, revealing how the life long gugak education has unfold showing its developing process. Also, the adult learner group becomes subdivided into middle aged ladies, demented elderly, foreigner, youth, office workers, college students, and members in a club for more detailed academic discussion. Research methodology has also widened its application of reference and materials using data collected from the field observation/participation, interview, questionnaire, actual distant class, and course evaluation.
The achievement and tendency of the study on adults’ gugak education in the perspective of life long gugak education are as follow. First of all, the growing academic interest during the early 2000s began with master’s thesis, and gradually proceeds to Ph. D. dissertation and scholars’ papers in academic journals. Secondly, Chung Ang University has conferred many degrees to the research on elderly gugak therapy program as well as its remedial value, and therefore the relevant research set one of the major paradigms. Thirdly, after 2015, scholars began to design many gugak programs applying various genres such as creative music, literati songs, vulgar folk vocal music, gayageum, haegeum, changgeuk (theaters), and percussive ensemble music. The importance of cultural communication and communal harmony were highlighted in foreigner gugak education.
Fourthly, recent study pays attention to the learner’s point of view and actual teaching scene reflecting and accepting individual ideas or the meaning that the learners imposed to their learning. Moreover, researchers have begun to write about distance learning and media applied education on the basis of VR, e-learning platform, Zoom, and smartphone applications.",장윤희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732023
국악치료교육이 정서지능과 사회성 증진에 미치는 영향,"The purpose of this study is to present a new classroom model of Korean music therapy education by reconstructing lesson plans of teaching-learning in various ways, thus employing group Korean music therapy classes in practice. The study recognized that 'music and health' was first introduced to the curricular elements in the domain of ‘music in daily life’ for 5th and 6th graders under the 2015 Revised Music Curriculum and was applied to school practice from 2019. It aimed to investigate the effects of Korean music therapy education on the improvement of emotional intelligence and sociality by developing teaching and learning lesson plans using traditional music elements. To this, previous studies related to music therapy and Korean music therapy for the past ten years were reviewed for analysis. The program for the study was designed targeting fifth and sixth graders of Dongdae elementary school in Ulsan.
To improve emotional intelligence, the teaching and learning plans developed for Korean music therapy included creating one’s own songs, Korean music and writing, Korean music and dance, vocal psychotherapy, Korean music and relaxation, Korean music and recreation, respiratory retention and deep breathing, slow tempo and softness in dynamics. To promote sociality, the teaching and learning plans developed for Korean music therapy included playing a musical instrument in groups, imitating sounds, transferring physical rhythms, improvising rhythms, playing motion musical instruments, therapy Nanta, playing together in gueum, and learning jandan in jangdan relays.
By applying the instructional measures above to regular music class, the study examined the difference in enhancing emotional intelligence and sociability before and after the lessons. Through this experimental study, it can be expected that Korean music therapy education can have a very positive therapeutic effect on enhancing emotional intelligence and sociality in children and adolescents.
It is of great significance to be able to apply Korean music therapy education to all general students while it has been applied only to a few special subjects such as multi-cultural families, children with special needs, children with severe disabilities typically during creative experiential activities or any other time but music class. It is also meaningful that Korean music therapy education can have educational and therapeutic effects at the same time that can allow character education and emotion-focused therapy and psychotherapy.",우덕상,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106058722
음악교육적 활용을 위한 장단의 학습 요소별 특성과 장단별 기보 방식 고찰,"Jangdan is one of the important characteristics of Korean music and is a major learning element for teaching Korean music in an authentic manner. Since the 2007 revised curriculum, learning elements related to jangdan, including Jangdankkol (patterns), Se(accent) of Jangdan, and Hanbae(tempo) of Jangdan, have been selected, and the corresponding teaching and learning take place within the music curriculum. This paper examined the characteristics of learning elements related to jangdan on a per-element basis and explored the level and instructional direction of music education related to Jangdan that should be taught in the field of public education.
In addition, in this paper, to deal with the time signature of Jangdan according to the types of “beat grouping” when transcribing Korean music pieces onto musical staff notation, it is divided into the case of ‘two sub beats’ and ‘three sub beats’ and the case of ‘mixed sub beats’. As a result, to notate Korean music pieces according to the characteristics of Jangdan, it was recommended to indicate a quarter note in the denominator part for the ‘two sub beats’ type of jangdan and a dotted quarter note in the denominator part for the ‘three sub beats’ type of jangdan. Thus, it was considered most optimal to indicate the type of “beat grouping” of Jangdan. In addition, it was revealed that in the case of the “mixed sub beats Jangdan”, it is most desirable to mark the time signature such as 3+2+3+2/8 and 3+2+3+2/♪ to reflect the characteristics of Korean music while adhering to the principle of marking the time signature in the staff notation system.",성기련,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732028

탈춤 춤사위의 창조적 계승을 위한 소고 - 기본무 춤사위 해체 및 재조합 작업을 중심으로 -,"This paper was initiated to find a way in which one can freely express movements of mask dance, which had been fixed since it was designated as the cultural heritage. To this end, it focused on the way of performing in nongak (percussion ensemble music)--the movements of performers are relatively free even after being designated as a national intangible cultural heritage--in order to apply it to mask dance.
First, this study selected Goseong ogwangdae, Yangju byeolsandae nori, and Gangnyeong talchum, which have relatively many dance movements among the basic dance of mask dance designated as national intangible cultural heritages.
Then, by analyzing the movements of basic dance in each region, it dismantled them by dividing them into upper and lower body parts just like the way of performing in nongak, and combined those dismantled movements of the three regions in various angles. In this process, it confirmed that each movement was classified based on beat, and classified and organized the dismantled movements as ""one-beat movement"", ""two-beat movement"", ""four-beat movement"", or ""fixed movement"" according to the beat. It also confirmed that the combination of the upper and lower body movements was made based on beat. Lastly, utilizing the results, this study created new dance movements by reorganizing the upper and lower body movements of mask dances in the three regions from various angles, and produced and presented a performance type of basic dance.
Through this process, this study confirmed that mask dance performances can be produced through dismantling and recombining, just like nongak. As the process of combining the dismantled dance movements gradually became familiar, it became possible to combine them in accordance to detailed subdivided beats. In addition, it was possible to design systematic education by producing the movements of mask dance according to the level of the students. It is hoped that the results of this study will be shared with more performers, leading to systematic classes and creative work using them.",박인수,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579826
국악-재즈 크로스오버와 전통 확장 이데올로기,"Since the late 20th century, plenty of collaborative works among Korean traditional musicians and jazz performers have emerged in the realm of “changjak gugak (lit. creative national music).” In 2020s, within the scene of traditional music-based crossover works, “elite” jazz musicians’ active participation and the use of musical elements of jazz music have become more and more visible.
During the same period, the discourses of “expansion,” “popularization,” and/or “modernization” of tradition has constantly circulated and consumed as a bundle of “spirit of the times.” Those discourses became intertwined together and thereby produced and reproduced two differentiated ideological time-spaces of “gugak musicians and listeners-premodern era-oldness-Korean (traditional) culture/music” and “the public(laymen)-modern times-newness-Western culture/music.” Because of these ideological frames, a variety of new gugak-jazz works constructed by a set of conventionalized and oft-outdated jazz performance skills and composing styles are often automatically categorized as examples of “musical expansion/modernization/ popularization” of traditional music that offer new kinds of experience, Many of those gugak-jazz crossover works which are totally not new in terms of artistic device are represented as new things “inertially” due to this existence of state-driven ideological discourses that semiotically connect the Western music to newness, which result in the crossover musicians’ benefit from the gugak-related financial aid programs offered by the state. Those discourses often ideologically dominate traditional music performers and related participants, thus the established style of gugak pieces with jazz-related elements are introduced as a “new expansion” of traditional music by musicians themselves as well asgugak-related mass media. This paper critically argues that such discursive convention that often unfairly elevates all kinds of gugak-jazz crossover works should be reconsidered and productively deconstructed for better understanding and critic of crossover gugak works.",박종현,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579821
전통악기 소금 연주 활동이 초등학교 아동의 정서적 안정감에 미치는 영향 연구,"The elementary school years is a period when one should build the foundation of one’s personality. It is time to develop adaptable and coping skills to lead a happier and healthier life than ever. In order to develop adaptability and coping skills, first of all, emotional stability is required. Children's emotional stability is closely related to one's inner ability, which can be controlled by an individual's will. Emotional stability develops through constant interaction between oneself and the environment throughout childhood and affects each child’s thinking and psychological function. An activity of performing musical instruments is needed as a way for children to find their positive energy and increase their emotional stability by regaining confidence and loving themselves during the growing-up period.
Therefore, this study examined the educational effects of playing the sogeum on Korean music pieces in elementary school textbooks regarding the characteristics of Korean music and how the sogeum performing activity affects the emotional stability of elementary students.
It was first divided into group A(children of a single mother) and group B(children of low-income households), and music therapy was conducted to examine the effects on the emotions of elementary students. For the results of the study, the tests were done by dividing the sub-factors of personality such as emotional expression, emotional regulation, and anxiety into pre- and post-tests. Targeting 24 children divided into groups A and B, the study used SPSS Windows 19.0 version for statistical processing to find the meaningful difference between before and after their soguem performing activity. The independent t-test was used to verify pre group homogeneity of group A and B. The matched sample t-test was used to verify the difference of pre-and post-test of the groups.
The results of the study revealed that there were improvements in emotional regulation, emotional expression, and anxiety and positive changes in school life due to the reduction of anxiety. It was found that the music therapy program through the soguem activity was effective in reducing emotional expression and anxiety and had a positive effect on experiencing psychological stability by helping express one’s emotions and feeling with the sogeum.",유아정,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107016515
조선 초기 <정동방곡>과 향ㆍ당악의 혼재,"This paper pays attention to features that have been overlooked in previous studies about Jeongdongbang-gok (靖東方曲), which is the earliest case where the song was played in hyangdangkyoju (鄕唐交奏, the ensemble of musical instruments for hyang-ak and dang-ak) during the early period of the Joseon dynasty. It was composed using the melody of Seogyeongbyeol-gok, but the note Muyeok was added to it, causing the six same notes as dang-ak to appear. The purpose of this study is to reveal the historical significance of Jeongdongbang-gok in the flow of musical history where hyang-ak and dang-ak were mixed.
Jeongdongbang-gok was played at ritual ceremonies in the era of King Sejong and the band performing the music consisted not only of musical instruments for hyang-ak but also of those for dang-ak. Moreover, Jeongdongbang-gok was the last song played in hyangdangkyoju.
The note Muyeok (無射, one of the twelve musical notes), which does not exist in Seogyeongbyeol-gok was added, making the notes appearing in the music to be the same as those appearing in a dang-ak Boheoja. Muyeok appears at a low frequency, serving as a passing tone. This indicates that Muyeok in Jeongdongbang-gok is not the main note constituting the scale, but rather an element of dang-ak added to the melody of Pyeongjo.
In conclusion, starting with Jeongdongbang-gok, hyangdangkyoju emerged along with a composition method in which elements of dang-ak were added to hyang-ak. The new music of King Sejong was also played in hyangdangkyoju. Additionally, it was found that the appearance and function of Muyeok are equally verified in Yeominrak. In the era of King Seongjong, more songs were played in hyangdangkyoju, and a new band was organized for hyangdangkyoju. Considering this historical flow, the historical significance of Jeongdongbang-gok was the first case ahead of the new music wherein the new method of hyangdangkyoju was applied and a piece of music was composed by adding elements of dang-ak to a melody of hyang-ak.",임영선,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107105932

Technology-based performing arts are expected to provide the future contents of a new industry in the 21st century. Furthermore, the global COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has affected the production and consumption of performing arts around the world, making technology and online platform for performing arts more important than before.
In March, 2020, the National Gugak Center released its brand new 360° Gugak VR (Virtual Reality) online via the Center’s own archive and You Tube. The purpose of Gugak VR are to increase interest in gugak by experiencing gugak performance without attendance at concert halls and by providing education on aspects of gugak. Gugak VR contents include short examples from performance of the 51 representative repertoires (Jongmyo Jeryeak, sinawi, buchaechum fan dance, seungmu monk dance, gut shaman ritual music and dance and more) from the four branches of the National Gugak Center.

교과서에 수록된 한국근대음악사의 문제점 및 개선방안 －2015 개정 중학교 음악교과서를 중심으로－,"This study examines the problems of Korean modern music history presented in 14 types of the 2015 revised middle school music textbooks and suggests measures for improvement.
First, the results of investigating the problems are as follows. Concerning periods and years (eras), they referred to both ‘the modern era’ and ‘the contemporary era’ as ‘the modern and contemporary era’ together, presented the point of the modern era that did not align with musical characteristics, or presented the point of the modern era with multiple different sections. Regarding learning goals and learning activities, they used implicitly vague verbs, mix modern and contemporary contents or lacked diversity and accuracy, especially in the case of learning activities. About learning content, they included information that was inconsistent with facts, lacked sufficient evidence, or omitted meaningful content requiring the need of learning. Concerning learning materials, they contained photographs that did not match the eras or the title, presented only illustrative materials without photographs or lacked learning materials that could provide diverse information.
About the problems above, this author suggests how to improve them as follows. Concerning periods and years (eras), it is needed to divide the modern and contemporary eras into ‘the modern era’ and ‘the contemporary era’ respectively and revise the point of modern times to ‘the end of the 19th century.’ The learning goals and learning activities are suggested to use clear and explicit verbs and exclude the contemporary era content. Learning activities are suggested to include new content that can connect with history and music subjects (from other units) and are suitable for learning modern music history. Learning contents are suggested to align with facts and evidence and include new learning contents that can help enhance the efficiency of learning. Learning materials are suggested to replace the ones with photos that match the times, include both illustrative materials and photographs, and add newspaper materials containing various information.
With this study as an opportunity, this author expects that the music-historical significance and educational value of Korean modern music history in the middle school music curriculum will be reevaluated and Korean modern music history to be included in the 2022 revised middle school music textbooks will be reborn as more accurate and efficient contents.",금용웅,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732032
일제강점기 ‘민요’의 개념사적 검토,"This study examines the process of forming the modern conceptual word 'folk song' from the 20th century through the conceptual history research methodology.
Japanese intellectuals in the 1920s emphasized the primacy, local color, or localism of Korean folk songs. In contrast, the intellectuals of the colonial Joseon added patriotism, ethnicity, and folkness over the transplanted concept. Since then, folk songs have been categorized and systemized. However, the classification system of folk songs made during the Japanese colonial period remained in the early stage and the categorization process was not systematic. Since the 1920s, the study of the traditional children’s song has made prophetic song more recognizable. This seems to be the result of resistance and ethnicity of folk songs of Joseon during the Japanese colonial period.
It is clear that folksong is one of the many modern conceptual words transplanted into Japanese colonies by Japanese intellectuals. However, it can be seen that the colonized Koreans added to the concept of transplanted folk songs the particularity of the Korean people and resisting folkness.",배인교,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105917826

Although the scale of susimga-tori, the songs of the west region, should be explained by ‘re-mi-sol-la-do’ or ‘la-do-re-mi-sol’, this paper discovered that the scales of susimga-tori in the books were explained by only ‘re-mi-sol-la-do’ regardless of the musical tones of the songs. Furthermore, although the scale of gyeong-tori, the songs of Seoul and Gyeonggi region need to be explained by ‘sol-la-do-re-mi’ and ‘la-do-re-mi-sol’, the scales of gyeong-tori songs in most of the books were demonstrated by using only a single scale. Because of the same scale of Ban susimga-tori & Ban gyeong-tori is explained by ‘la-do-re-mi-sol’, So it is required to present the scores with the sigimsae for instructing the characteristics of tori.
As a result, this paper emphasizes that it is important to present the scores using the proper scale as well as using sigimsae when instructing the characteristics of Korean folk songs by tori. Also, it suggests that the approaches to the tori of Korean folk song should be more effective by relating a larger variety of folk songs to various teaching and learning activities.",변미혜,2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104800453
아리랑 연구의 성과와 과제 －아리랑의 유네스코 등재 후 10년간을 대상으로－,"As of 2022, it is the 10th anniversary of Korea's Arirang being registered as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO in 2012. This article is to review the research achievements on Arirang over the past 10 years, and to explore future research tasks for Arirang based on the results. The number of studies on Arirang that has been conducted over the past 10 years amounted to 200 in total. We can name the study of Arirang as an independent academic field, Arirang Studies.
Arirang studies can be broadly divided into Arirang tradition theory and Arirang culture theory. Arirang tradition theory is further divided into Arirang Policy Theory, Arirang Characteristics Theory, Arirang Media Theory, Regional Arirang Theory, and Arirang Information Theory according to important themes of the study. Arirang culture theory is divided into Arirang Literature Theory, Arirang Content Theory, Arirang Healing Theory, and Arirang Education Theory according to the pattern of accepting or utilizing Arirang. After Arirang was registered as UNESCO, there were many discussions to suggest cultural policies to utilize Arirang as cultural assets or to develop cultural contents. In the midst of this, the need for a rigorous academic discussion on regional Arirang was raised, and critical views on the phenomenon of institutions leading folk songs also appeared. Opinions on regional cultural branding based on the identification of regional Arirang's identity were also presented. Studies to elucidate the characteristics of Arirang were also conducted from various perspectives. Studies on records and scores related to early Arirang, research on the cultural characteristics of Arirang and its character as a subculture, a study on the discourse of Arirang, a study on the popularization or folk song of Arirang, and a study on the perception of Arirang in North Korea and abroad were conducted. In relation to Arirang Media Theory, extensive research has been conducted on the musical characteristics of Arirang spread through media such as records and broadcasting. Above all, research on regional Arirang has been very active. While research on the well-known Jeongseon Arirang, Miryang Arirang, and Jindo Arirang continues, interest in Incheon Arirang, Mungyeong Saejae Arirang, Yeongcheon Arirang, Gongju Arirang, Asan Arirang, and Cheongju Arirang has increased significantly. Also, discussions about Daegu Arirang and Dongnae Arirang, which were released during the Japanese colonial period, were newly held. With the Arirang Information Theory, research was conducted to establish a DB and archive to systematically preserve and utilize Arirang-related data, and there was also an experimental study using the Arirang information algorithm.
As one of the Arirang cultural theory, research on the acceptance and transformation of literature of Arirang has been conducted, while research on cultural contents using Arirang has been conducted in various fields. In particular, research to develop cultural contents in connection with regional Arirang has been the mainstream. Research on creative music that embraces Arirang, research on gymnastics and dance using Arirang, and research on festivals related to Arirang are also meaningful in that they increase and expand interest in Arirang culture. Arirang Healing Theory, a study that proves the psychological healing effect of Arirang singing, has formed a new research trend. A study on the effective educational method of Arirang was conducted with a focus on music education.
In the future, there remains a task for the joint registration of Arirang between South and North Korea, and academic dialogue is needed for the unified use of Arirang-related terms. While research on Arirang related to new media such as electronic media is requested, academic debate on regional Arirang-related issues needs to be revitalized. It should be urgently supplemented to show the actual utilization results of the Arirang archive estab...",박경수,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108398439

제주시 창민요 ‘너영나영’의 교육적 활용 방안 연구,"The primary objective of this paper is to develop teaching and learning plans for Jeju folk songs that enable students to acquire and apply learning content within real-life contexts, in support of the development of the ‘competency enhancement curriculum.’ To this end, the study focused on the most prominently featured Jeju folk song in textbooks, ‘Neoyeongnayeong’. It involved reviewing the instructional content within the textbooks related to this song, examining how ‘Neoyeongnayeong’ is being transmitted within the Jeju community, and compiling musical scores from firsthand data collected through direct engagement with the lives of local residents. The developed teaching and learning plans were applied to fourth-grade students in one school within Juju city. The target for the utilization of the analytical data is the materials collected and analyzed directly by the researcher.
A teaching-learning course plan that can be used in school education was composed and developed from the following perspectives. It was conducted in three phases for fourth-grade elementary students in Jeju, and the learning activity sheets were analyzed.
First, the sheet music of ‘Neoyeongnayeong’ included in the textbooks was utilized as a learning source by comparing it with the directly transcribed sheet music of the song ‘Neoyeongnayeong,’ which has been designated as an intangible cultural heritage of Jeju Island.
Second, in order to foster an understanding of Jeju culture, the lyrics of ‘Neoyeongnayeong,’ sung by a holder of Jeju’s intangible cultural heritage, were used to explore the natural symbolism of Jeju. This was achieved by ‘Byeongdambyeongju’ in the art book <Tamnasullyeokdo> to visualize Jeju’s musical culture for learning purposes.
As a learning plan for Jeju folk songs, which have not yet found their place as tori, students are expected to naturally grasp their characteristics as they become familar with song materials that are closely linked with the emotions of the locals and explore the places, objects, and backgrounds associated with the folk songs.
It is an ongoing task to study how Jeju's music culture, permeated with the lives of local residents, can be used in school education.",홍주희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732025
북한의 아동음악교육 연구 －1950~1960년대『조선음악』기사를 중심으로－,"This study examined vocal, instrumental, music appreciation, and creative education respectively, with a particular focus on the content published in ‘Joseon Music,’ a publication by the Joseon Musicians Alliance to research children's music education in North Korea during the 1950s and 1960s.
The study's key findings are as follows: Firstly, in ‘vocal education,’ vocalization education emphasized respiratory training, incorporating exercises that integrate breathing and pronunciation. Methods such as Soviet-style vowel exercises and imitation of animal sounds were identified. Vocalization placed importance on head voice, and a step-by-step practice approach was observed. The core of education for the sense of musical sound lied in, auditory training, which is the memory training of sounds. This included exercises in recognizing pitch, identifying timbre, and distinguishing harmonies.
Secondly, in ‘instrumental education,’ an emphasis was placed on playing rhythms and melodies that reflect Korean sentiments when instructing not only traditional korean musical instruments but also foreign instruments. The goal was to harmonize the functional aspects and emotional domains of education, while taking into account the physical growth and psychological aspects of the children.
Thirdly, the primary objective of music appreciation was identified as instructing students to consciously listening to and understanding good music. Music appreciation guidance in the People's School primarily focused on vocal music appreciation while incorporating instrumental music appreciation in a balanced manner, considering the children's level.
Lastly, in ‘creative education,’ the aspect of ‘creation reflecting ethnic sensibility’ was addressed through methods such as utilizing children's folk songs, simultaneous performance of folk instruments and singing, and children's songs by oral tradition. “Considering children's emotions in music creation” emphasized the need for composers to understand children's emotions in their daily lives and encouraged them to produce works based on their subjective judgment and experiences. The argument that music entertainment preferences favored by children should be reflected in compositions was also confirmed.",문주석,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108732022
한성기 가야금병창 <어화청춘> 고찰,"Han Seongki (1889~1950), born from Yeong'am, Jeolla Province, was a musician proficient in gayageum (12-string plucked zither) sanjo (solo instrumental music) and byeongchang (singing with playing an instrument) in the first half of the 20th century. He learned sanjo and byeongchang from Kim Changjo and then passed them on to Choi Oksan and Kim Jukpa. His music, mainly gayageum sanjo and byeongchang, remained through the records of the first half of the 20th century; the repertoire of gayageum byeongchang includes a variety of music such as dan'ga (lit. short song sung before performing pansori), pansori (musical storytelling), japga (folk songs sung by professionals), and minyo (folk songs sung by the general public). While the studies on his sanjo have been relatively active, there are a few studies on his byeongchang. Yet, since these studies have not considered his sanjo and byeongchang together, there are some limitation that they do not properly illuminate Han Seong-gi's unique musicality from the perspective that he was well versed in gayageum and sori (vocal). This paper focuses on the piece of gayageum byeongchang ""Eohwa Cheongchun"" among the music he left behind.
Han Seongki's dan'ga ""Eohwa Cheongchun"" has been released as a record three times and, according to the records from Gyeongseong Broadcasting Station, it was one of Han Seong-ki's main repertoires. In particular, it is speculated that ""Gongdobaekbal"", ""Gongdonan"", and ""Baekbalga"" sung by Han Seongki are related to ""Eohwa Cheongchun"" in that they share the similar lyrics.
“Chieron38 Eohwa Cheongchun” and “CoreaH7 Eohwa Cheongchun” recorded in 1932 and 1935, respectively, are made up of almost the same lyrics, but the beginning of “CoreaH7 Eohwa Cheongchun” adds the phrase starting with “Gongdorani baekbaliyo... ”. After that, the lyrics following after “Eohwacheongchun...” proceed in the same way on both albums, which is a structure in which the lyrics used in any dan'ga are appropriately included and independent lyrics are placed in between. This shows the spontaneous and free reconstruction of dan'ga at the time. In addition, it is presumed that it was reconstructed by Han Seongki in that a unit song with the same composition as Han Seongki's ""Eohwa Cheongchun"" has not been found among those materials recorded at that time and dan'ga pieces passed down today.
“CoreaH7 Eohwa Cheongchun” is unique in that the length recorded for the entire album is about 3 minutes and 30 seconds and about 1 minute at the beginning is only a gayageum performance. This gayageum part plays the same role as the daseureum (prelude) of sanjo, comparing to the version of Han Seongki's among the daseureum of Kim Juk-pa’s gayageum sanjo. In “Chieron38 Eohwa Cheongchun,” the gayageum melody at the beginning is short, about 11 seconds, and instead, the gayageum melody of about 22 seconds is added in the form of a postlude. The aspects in the two records appear different, but the records of ""Eohwa Cheongchun"" clearly reveals the ability of Han Seongki, who was good at gayageum sanjo, and it can be seen that he changed his music by linking sanjo and byeongchang.
The vocal melody of the byeongchang on both records is almost the same.
Considering “CoreaH7 Eohwa Cheongchun”, it is centered on the 4th skeleton of 'sol-do' and the 2nd progression of 'do-re', there is the vibrato on the note of 'sol' and the regression on the note of 're'. The cadence of the paragraph is repeated with the phrase of 'Sol-do-La-Sol-Sol', and moves up to a higher register as it progresses to the second half, changing the music. While the gayageum accompaniment's melody in byeongchang is generally the same as the vocal’s melody, the gayageum performance, characterized by sufficient virtuosity and musical expression, is splendid compared to other gayageum byeongchang of the time.
As a result, Han Seongki's gayageum byeongchang ""Eohwa Cheongchun"" clearly demonstrates his ...",신은주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579829
경극과 판소리 화용도의 사설 비교 연구,"This study compared and analyzed saseol (texts like lyrics and dialogues) of Chinese Peking opera Hwayongdo (華容道 The Huarong Path) and the passage of ""Hwayongdo"" in Korean pansori (musical storytelling) Jeokbyeokga. To this end, reviewing the written materials related to the Peking opera Hwayongdo, it found that it was first included under the title Dangcao in Chewangfu quben, a collection of librettos of early Peking opera works from the mid-Qing Dynasty (1636-1912).
The title Hwayongdo was first used in the ""Qingshengping ban ximu"" (repertoire of plays by the Qingshengping troupe) of the Chinese literature Dao Xian yilai Liyuan xinian xiaolu (a small record of the theater from the Daoguang and Xianfeng) at the 4th year of the Daoguang Emperor (1824).
The results of comparing the saseol of the Peking opera Hwayongdo included in Jingju chuantong juben huibian (a collection of traditional Peking opera scripts) with that of ""Hwayongdo"" in Jeokbyeokga performed by Song Sun-seop are as follows. First, the Hwayongdo of the two countries were different in terms of saseol composition by each section. Scenes were added to the beginning section in Peking opera whereas they were added in the middle and final sections in pansori. Second, the development of saseol contents was generally similar, but there were differences in the focal point of the description. Pansori ""Hwayongdo"" had a strong tendency to express the character's way of speaking, expression, and appearance vividly and realistically. However, the Peking opera Hwayongdo was concisely organized around the plot.
This phenomenon is not only because Chinese audiences are more familiar with the contents of the novel The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but also because the dialogue, acting, and makeup of Peking opera actors were able to vividly express Hwayongdo and thus a realistic description was unnecessary. On the other hand, Korean audiences would have been very curious about the exotic subject matter and characters appearing in ""Hwayongdo"" and to satisfy this curiosity, a more detailed description and added content would have been needed.
This study are significant in that they confirm how the traditional performing art of China and Korea, both based on the same novel The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, has developed as different types of contents in the process of accommodating the performance environment and the taste of audiences.",동이린,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579824

2015 개정 초등학교 음악교과서에 나타난 굿거리장단 지도의 문제점과 개선 방안,"This study reviewed the current state of teaching the gutgeori jangdan shown in elementary school textbooks, and examined the problems of gutgeori jangdan teaching for elementary school students and improvement plans based on it. The results are as follows.
First, we looked at the contents of the gutgeori jangdan in elementary school music textbooks for each of the 8 publishers. The result indicated that the gutgeori jangdan is mainly introduced in the sixth grade course in the form of jeongganbo including janggu marks, gueum, and accents and appears four times on average for each publisher based on the unit or song materials. Also, it was found that the gutgeori jangdan mainly appeared in the form of accompaniment to vocal songs, and activities such as singing along with the gutgeori jangdan or singing while playing the gutgeori jangdan are mainly suggested Next, the contents of elementary school textbooks revealed the following problems in teaching the gutgoeri jangdan such as lack of exposure to the gutgeori jangdan, inconsistency between gueum and actual notation, insufficient explanation of special playing techniques and lack of activities, lack of activities in various jangdan forms, and incompatible accent marks.
Finally, as a way to improve these, the contents of the gutgeori jangdan and the teaching method were presented respectively. Improvement plans for the gutgeori jangdan contents include rearrangement of the gutgeori jangdan contents by grade level, notation faithful to the technique of rolling a stick, and changing gueum of the technique of rolling a stick. Improvement plans for teaching the gutgeori jangdan include teaching gutgeori jangdan variations, step-by-step instruction of the technique of rolling a stick, and effective teaching of special performance techniques.
It is hoped that this study will be helpful for effective teaching of gutgeori jangdan in the field of elementary education, and it is expected that in-depth follow-up research will continue.",이상규,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108042366
휘모리잡가를 활용한 국악교육 지도방안－2015 개정 5~6학년을 중심으로－,"There are various genres of musical pieces in Korean vocal music. However, the current elementary music curriculum has limitedly selected some pieces from the genres of folk songs and pansori for in-class use. The genre of japga, a representative of the Gyeonggi-province music, is not covered in the elementary school music textbooks. In the case of long-japga, it is considered a highly difficult piece to learn. On the other hand, Hwimori-japga is deemed appropriate to in-class singing activities and lessons in elementary schools since it has humorous lyrics, simple melodies, repetitious rhythms and beats, and reasonable vocal ranges.
This study identified the problems of the current elementary music education through the analysis of the 2015 revised elementary school music textbooks. As a solution, it suggested teaching plans for the singing education of Korean music using ‘Bawi taryeong,’ ‘Bidan taryeong,’ and ‘Maengkkongi taryeong’ from Hwimori-japga. This utilization was developed to meet the criteria of the activities areas required in the 2015 revised elementary school music curriculum.
Even if the amount of Korean music has been secured in the textbook, people’s perception of Korean music cannot be improved when the textbook always covers the same repertoire of educational content without any systematic structure. In that sense, it is urgent to develop Korean music songs for in-class use, and it is hoped that this study will be helpful.",조수경,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107020029
2015 개정 음악과 교육과정에 따른 국악 합주곡의 방향 모색: 초ㆍ중학교 음악 교과서 활용,"The purpose of this study is to suggest the direction of Gugak ensemble pieces of elementary and middle schools required by the revised 2015 curriculum, utilizing the Gugak instrumental music from the current music textbook. As a result, the direction of Gugak instrumental ensemble can be summarized in four major ways. First, musical instruments should be presented to understand and creatively express the interaction of sound through various musical experiences. Second, we need to play various instruments to understand how to express music and to express music in various ways using the overall mood and characteristics of the music. Third, to understand the elements that make up music and the characteristics of the musical music and connect the musical knowledge and activities organically, one should experience playing the musical rather than listening. Fourth, the musical elements of the grade military level should be linked to activities. In order to compensate for these problems, Chapter 3 used the contents of the music textbook of school level (grade) to explore the direction of the Korean traditional instrumental ensemble by dividing it into Jeongak, folk music, and creative songs. As a result, the 3rd and 4th graders of elementary school proposed the instrumental ensemble of <Daechwita>, physical activities, singing songs of JajinmorJangdan, and percussion ensemble. The fifth and sixth graders proposed a combination of <Festival> and <New Boat Song> by linking some of the first chapters of the HyeonakYoungsanhoesang to Janggu and Danso, and <GutgeoriJangdan> to <Samchae Jangdan> and <Byeoldalgeori> In the first course of middle school, the direction of the composition of Gayageum, Sogeum, Danso, and percussion was found, and some of the pieces were proposed by HyeonakYoungsanhoesang, Chapter 1 ensemble of <Taryeong>, the ensemble of folk song sanctions, and <The Introduction to Gugak Orchestra for Youth>. In Music 2, <Jongmyo Jeryeak> is performed in the form of a dance music using Sogeum, Danso, Haegeum, Janggu, group, Modumbuk, Soribuk, household goods, etc., and the creation and activities of simple application of percussion ensemble, ensemble sanction song <Prince of Jeju> and <Beautiful Country> are conducted through a series of activities.",김순진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106931354
조선후기 풍류문화의 음악교육적 접근－역사·문화사적 배경을 중심으로－,"Pungryu covered in the middle school music textbook under the 2015 revised curriculum mainly centers on gagok (songs based on traditional poetry in the Joseon Period), sijo (a Korean traditional poetic form that emerged in the Goryeo Period), and Yeongsanhoesan (a suite of instrumental pieces originated from Buddhist music.) Pungryu is not only focused on particular genres among various pungryu music but also barely utilized as in-class activity materials in the area of singing or music appreciation. While some contents were covered in the Pungryu category, there are quite a few cases found in the context irrelevant to Pungryu. Thus, it is impossible to have a multi-level understanding of gagok, sijo, and Yeongsanhoesan in the textbooks. Moreover, as the Pungryu-related contents in the late Joseon Period music, which should be explained in the context of cultural history, are so simple, it is difficult to understand the development of Pungryu in detail.
In order to resolve the problems and limitations of the contents of Pungryu covered in middle school music textbooks, it is necessary to approach the contents of the Pungryu development in the late Joseon Period from the perspective of history and cultural history. For this reason, the study aimed to discuss the backgrounds of the pungryu development from the perspective of history and cultural history and present educational plans based on the contents.
Chapter 3 discussed the background of the Pungryu development from three aspects: expansion of the population who enjoyed Pungryu, changes in styles of enjoyment, and expansion of the population responsible for Pungryu. Chapter 4 dealt with educational approaches to education plans based on the historical and cultural history background of the Pungryu development in the late Joseon Period from the following perspectives: utilizing the contents related to the extension of the population who enjoyed Pungryu in the late Joseon Period, the contents of various musical instruments accommodated to Pungryubang, the contents of various repertoires extension, and social and cultural meanings of Pungryubang.",임미선,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107016361

The paper explores current status of sociocultural traditional music education for disable people answering the questions about how has the research on traditional music education for the disabled people been conducted, What has happened among the disabled people with the traditional music learning? What is its meaning as in the sociocultural context? The sociocutural traditional music education for disabled people is complicated combining ideas of musical learning, social interaction, and human nature. In this regard some data is collected through ethnography. The research figured out that the traditional music education for disable people raised their sense of belonging in the society, while at the same time helped them gain a sense of achievement and self-confidence because the traditional music gave them a sense of unity and ways to communicate with not only class mates but also people outside the classroom.

2015 개정 초·중등 음악교과서의 국악 창작 활동 구현 양상,"This study aimed to review the content related to the creation of Korean music in the 2015 revised music curriculum and examined the educational significance of Korean music creation activities in light of the previous studies. It also analyzed patterns of Korean music creation activities embodied in the 2015 revised music textbooks for elementary and middle schools. The findings of the study are as follows.
Firstly, in the area of expression in the 2015 revised music curriculum, the criteria for performing were presented according to the musical elements of ‘lyrics, malbuchimsae, jangdankkol, and melody’ in relation to the creation activities of Korean music. These achievement criteria have the educational significance of developing a new singing culture by learning the language of Korean music and recreating it through imitation and transformation.
Secondly, the analysis of Korean music creation activities in music textbooks showed that the frequency of activities for lyric creation was the highest (45.92%), followed by jangdankkol creation(23.47%), melody creation(19.39%), and malbuchimsae creation (11.22%). After analyzing the contents and methods of Korean music creation activities according to each element, it is difficult to claim that the methods of Korean music creation presented in the previous studies have yet to be actively reflected. However, it should be avoided to illicit creation activities by relying solely on the characteristics of songs, without prior learning about types of malbuchimsae corresponding to the jangdan or various types of the melodic progression corresponding to the tori.
Thirdly, the result of examining the technique of notation of Korean music creation activities revealed that the general use of pictorial scores, garakseon scores, Jeongganbo, jangdan symbol and oral sounds of janggu were widely used in elementary school music textbooks. On the other hand, staff notation and rhythm notation along with Jeongganbo were used in middle school music textbooks. It is believed that middle school music textbooks should also include various notation methods depending on students' levels and utilize them to help express the characteristics of Korean music.
It is indispensable that future studies of Korean music creation activities be conducted on the basis of the principle of sequence and continuity. The findings of the studies should offer a gradually extended activity by highlighting level-appropriate differentiation and preventing simple repetition while the experience of Korean music creation activities during elementary school is connected to that of middle schools.",김민하,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106337063
한국의 음악박물관 현황과 육성과제,"In this paper, I tried to examine the current status of music related-museums in Korea. As a musicologist, I believe for our scholarship, musicology to develop and establish firmly in Korea, we need full-fledged museums dedicated specifically to music. We have only a handful of museums dedicated to music: National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts' Museum(Seoul), National Center for Korean Folk Performing Arts' Museum(Namwon), Nangye Korean Music Museum(Yondgdong), Pansori Museum(Gochang), Chamsori Gramophone & Edison Museum(Kangnung), Museum of Musical Instruments of the World(Paju) are the few museums specialized in music in Korea. As music is essential part of everyday life and culture, a few museums of folklore, arts, religious ceremonies or rite of rituals, have some collections of musical instruments or performance practices' artifacts. Good such examples are Kongju Folk Drama Museum, mask Museums(Hahoe and Galchon), Museum of the Center for Latin America, Global Village Folk Museum, Global Village Hinterland Folk Museum, African Art Museum and Tibet Museums(Taewonsa and Seoul). Most of the museums mentioned above, even the large one, have less than 3-400 items in one category. Most of the music-related museums in Korea are preoccupied by exhibition while lacking such research functions as pursuing own speciality and enriching their collections with scholastic efforts. The ratio of the items exhibited to the items held in storage is extremely low and the informations offered for the visitors is not systematically organized or scholastically approached. Lacking professionalism, many of the musical instruments and items are exhibited and illustrated by non-music professionals, thus being mistreated in terms as classification, language, and other informations.
