In addition, the Internet and digital literacy are important tools for webtoon production, and their development has a profound impact on the way webtoons are produced. New innovative technologies induce social change and become an important means of solving and changing socioeconomic problems. Innovative technologies are linked to society, economy, and education as a whole, which lay the foundation for creating new social structures. The world is changing, and the number of people who want to lead better lives by the means of new technology is increasing. With the recent advent of the era of generative AI creation overseas, the domestic webtoon industry also seems to have entered the stage of introducing and testing experimental technologies through large platforms and startups. At this day and age of change, it is urgent for the sound growth of the webtoon industry to require research from generative AI-based artificial intelligence webtoon writers. Additionally, before introducing a full-fledged webtoon production system of generative AI, it is necessary to discuss the current status of domestic and foreign artificial intelligence creative technology development, subjective perception of creation, copyright infringement controversy, and present the potential development of artificial intelligence webtoon writers. This study examines the development process of generative AI technology and analyzes the spread of artificial intelligence webtoon technology in five factors: relative advantage, suitability, complexity, attemptability, and observability from the theoretical perspective of Rogers' innovation spread. Based on this, the research is meaningful in presenting modeling for the adoption of innovation and technology spread of artificial intelligence webtoon writers and presenting the direction of development in the future artificial intelligence webtoon production ecosystem. Because the application of artificial intelligence technology is still in the planning, story composition, screen production, and character design processes of works that require unique creativity and originality of webtoon artists still has many problems to solve in the future. However, artificial intelligence webtoon writers are emerging as a new alternative for the expansion and qualitative growth of the webtoon industry for repetitive and long-term work hours such as background design and coloring. As such, the use and spread of artificial intelligence technology can lead to increased efficiency, saved working hours, and reduced costs of webtoon production. This will have a positive impact on Korean webtoons that continue to drive the global market in the future.",이승진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108634197
영화에 반영된 영화음악에 관한 연구,"The golden age of Hollywood film score was up to the early 1960's. That hollywood film score's development was possible was two reason.
First, studio system in Hollywood was developed and the great composers, such as Max Steiner, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Alfred Newman, were born in succession. Peculiarity to their music are a theme music attendant upon psychology of the characters and development of the situation, leitmotive and symphony for orchestra in the whole reel.
Second, another reason is social economy changes. A great number of European composer went to America during World warn, the healthy economy after the end of the 2nd war affected development of large-scale symphonic sound.
Owing to complicated factor, symphony for orchestra was come to stay in Hollywood. This paper analyzed John Williams' score which upholded the theory of artistic backing of Erich Wolfgang Korngold, placed the focus on the connection between music and image.

It is notable that these films, Spike Jonze’s Her(2014), Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049(2017), and Michael Almereyda’s Marjorie Prime(2017) describe artificial intelligence on a everyday and personal level, which was often somewhat exaggerated as a threat in the past science fiction films. Three films as SF genre were produced in the mid-2010s, and at the same time, the artificial intelligence is disembodied or virtual hologram. In addition, it is problematic in that these films set the artificial intelligence as the being who can coexist with human by learning and embodying love, emotional labor, and memory which are human’s own uniqueness. The argument related with aspects of the artificial intelligence as relational being is based on post-human discourse. In this respect, each film explores the possibility of love between humans and artificial intelligence, reveals artificial intelligence’s gendered emotional labor, and checks the possibility that human memory can be reconstructed by artificial intelligence. Through the representation of artificial intelligence, this paper points out that the artificial intelligence’s being and the relationship between human and the machine are linked to post-human thought.",박소연,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107001431
"역사 재해석과 영화적 재현에 대한 연구: ＜덕혜옹주＞, ＜나랏말싸미＞를 중심으로","This paper intends to examine two historical films under the concept of ‘present pasts’ by Andreas Huyssen. According to Huyssen, a historical film does not represent the past in a cinematic way, but in the present perspective. Thus, it is possible that a historical film become an intense political film depending on its interpretation. From this perspective, I would analyze The Last Princess(덕혜옹주) and The King's Letters(나랏말싸미), which had been controversial over historical distortions to explain how a film deals with the present past, how we can look at the present past which the film deals with, and how we should understand an issue of historical distortions in this way.
The Last Princess distorts the historical facts so obviously. This film strengthens the nationalist sentiment by emphasizing the fact that the princess Deokhye was forced to move to a Japan, to marry with a Japanese man, and to get divorced, including being confined to a mental hospital. Moreover, the film creates a fictional character described as if he joined in the independence movement, and represents the princess Deokhye as the image of the victim. What is more important in this representation is that The Last Princess has the narrative that coincides with the “sexual slavery” of the Japanese army, and has appealed",강성률,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106490216
공간을 활용한 시간과 꿈의 구조적 표현 영화 <인셉션>을 중심으로,"<Inception>, directed by Christopher Nolan, released in 2010, caused a lot of controversy with its esoteric yet sophisticated logic designed plot and shocking visualization of the unconscious. Various point of time and stages of dreams are expressed in the story of <Inception>, and space is used very effectively to convey this intricately overlapping structure of the unconscious. By analyzing the space of the unconscious expressed in the work in detail and closely examining Christopher Nolan's use of space and methods of expression, I tried to reconsider the meaning of space in the film. This study examines how the space is used in the film based on the analysis of the multi-layered point of time of <Inception> and the structure of the unconscious, sequentially analyzing the space expressed according to the flow of time of the film. Based on the theoretical background of a space of film, visual and phenomenal characteristics were analyzed.
A total of 49 spaces were produced in the film, and 22 of them were expressed as spaces of the unconscious. The specific characteristic of the space described in <Inception> is the first, a surreal space that experiences spatial totality. As a spatial situation in which surreal phenomena are compounded in the physical space of the unconscious, it is a space where you can experience the spatial totality in which the overlapping spaces are influenced by each other by a parallel time penetrating the multi-layered dream space. Second, it is the inner space of the character. The space described in <Inception> is a space of representation in which the latent spaces and objects in their unconscious are expressed from the past memories, wounds, and guilt of major characters including 'Cobb'. Third, it is a transformed space according to the structure of the unconscious. Although it is the same space, it reinforces the narrative structure by expressing transformation and distortion in the visual elements that make up the space according to the level of dream, while also expressing ambiguity about the boundary between reality and dream. The space expressed in <Inception> can be seen as a very effective spatial communication device that delivers the director's message and the theme of the film, supports the film's narrative, and reinforces the characters' characteristics.",최승원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108532899
애니메이션의 초현실 공포 심상 연구 <코렐라인>을 중심으로,"orror imagery is an image that reflects the fear of reality hidden deep in people's minds. The generation of fear images depends on the emotions of fear.
Fear is inevitable as the oldest emotion of mankind, which determines the research value of fear imagery. People avoid stimulating causes that can spontaneously stimulate fear in real life, but this is not something that can completely avoid or eliminate fear. Fear is always buried in people's subconscious, waiting for outside stimuli and expecting to be released.
Animation is a visual art that can show horror images to the audience in a safe environment. However, due to the composition of horror imagery, these animations will inevitably feature bloody scenes of violence and death. Many distributors have produced crude and low-cost 'class B horror videos' to satisfy the audience's bizarreness. Therefore, the film industry and academia are divided over whether the horror genre of animation is worth researching and what the meaning of horror imagery is. Surrealism has now become history as an art faction, but the creative techniques left by surrealism have been absorbed into other art fields and are shining again. In this paper, we introduce surreal features to make it a surreal horror image based on the horror image of animation. We analyze the surreal horror imagery of the animation ""Coraline"" and focus on the concrete expression of the realistic horror imagery in the animation and the realistic meaning behind it.
This paper first classifies horror imagery, introduces its main source composition and expression method in animation, and then explains the surreal characteristics to further clarify the concept of surreal horror imagery. Based on this, Chapter 3 uses the animation ""Coreline"" as an analysis example to clarify the realistic meaning of the sur-real horror image by interpreting the specific expression of the animation's surreal horror image in both narrative space and character image. In other words, it was concluded that the subscription of surreality to the visual symbol of the horror image of animation was not only to give a strong visual shock to the audience. Surrealistic creative techniques have increased the depth of horror imagery, making it a horror material that cannot be ignored in animation creation.",장카이,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108634189
영화 <기생충>의 욕망의 자리와 환상의 윤리,"This study psychoanalytically interprets a film <PARASITE>(2019) focusing on the place of desire and fantasy ethics. First, this film begins with two presents.
The tutoring place that was given to Ki-woo together with a landscape stone by his friend Min-hyuk becomes a chance not only for Ki-woo to desire for Min-hyuk’s desire, but also to ignite the desire of Ki-taek’s family. After that, Ki-taek’s family occupies the jobs in President Park’s house. However, their plan goes wrong because of such an unexpected place of basement. Because of Geun-se hidden in the basement, Moon-gwang who has been kicked out of the place by Ki-taek’s family comes back. In order to occupy the place, Ki-taek’s family and Moon-gwang & Geun-se couple fight with each other as a mirror pair.
This changes this film into a bloody affair, which is led to a failure of the plan the family has dreamed of. In this work, the position has an attribute to make others desire for desire or make them compete and fight each other. On the other hand, a place of fantasy is a place that should not be invaded as a space for the subject oneself. This could be understood from Ki-taek’s accidental murder of President Park. The relevant work shows the currently-intensified neoliberalistic competition and social polarization for all sorts of social positions including jobs through allegory. Nevertheless, the film <PARASITE> suggests the fantasy ethics as a condition for the symbiosis of members of society, instead of simply talking about economic inequality and conflict.",손성우,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106362865
SF 영화 <가타카(GATTACA)>에 나타난 주요 상징 기호 분석,"GATTACA is a science fiction film about the future genetic hierarchy and control society. It is a work that sparked public interest and debated about genetic engineering. The film states the question, ‘Is it reasonable to manipulate life beyond the providence of God or the nature?’ Furthermore, it conveys the messages that there is no perfect science, that science alone cannot fully comprehend or explain human beings, and that science can always degenerate as a tool to control human beings. GATTACA sharply criticizes the scientific perfection ideology, the new eugenics ideology, and the groups that promote them. However, the film does not deny that humans have lived through science to make up for the lack of nature; it deals with the problem of finding the ‘new balance between nature and science’. The director’s critical messages and questions are evident, not only through the composition and content of the film, but also through various symbols closely placed throughout the film. The important symbols (especially the body, the Gattaca office building, the sea, the DNA image, and the murder) are organically intertwined, conveying the message of the film in various ways, deriving various nuances, and raising the aesthetic level of the film. Therefore, this article helps to understand the meaning of the multidimensional reflection of GATTACA more deeply and more clearly by clarifying the detailed connection structure and multi-layered meaning of the symbols.",남운,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107001372

영화 미장센을 통해 살펴본 사회계층 간 아비투스 특징고찰,"The popular Korean movie <Parasite> 2019 has been a massive box office hit with more than 10,068,252 viewers to date. Directed by Bong Joon-ho, <Parasite> is a black comedy suspense movie where Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family live in a semi-basement dump. It shows the events that unfold as Ki-taek’s son, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), starts a job as a private English tutor to the daughter of CEO of a top firm. The movie <Parasite> was chosen as the subject of this study because it dealt with current world problems of class segregation while at the same time earning the favor of the audience. The study was conducted to examine the social class gap drawn by the world and characters within the film through Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of ‘habitus’ while at the same time examining how the cultural gap of Korean society is handled within the film. In particular, the study was conducted to show how the habitus gap between classes was expressed through the analysis of various ‘mechanisms’ and ‘mise-en-scene.’ Analysis shows an image of a ‘staircase’ that effectively portrays the social position and class as the very device that differentiates the classes inside the society. The title itself, ‘Parasite,’ is a very effective mechanism that reveals the characters’ way of life.
With the house as the host, Moon-gwang and Ki-taek’s family are the parasites trying to take possession of the host as the film portrays a class symbiotic relationship between the host and the parasite.
One of these characteristics is that the higher classes use their abundant financial resources to control the time and space of those amongst the lower classes. The act of ‘crossing the line’ is often a form of behavior that is performed by the higher class toward the lower class. This line of authority is one way and cannot be overturned.
References to these acts and the attitudes of the characters toward them are shown repeatedly in the movie, <Parasite>, to effectively express ‘class’ and ‘hierarchy’ that exist in our society.
The biggest feature found through the analysis was the usage of the spatial feature of the ‘house.’ Social groups, based upon their material wealth, will form groups through judging of their residential environments which are then used to symbolize the distance between such social groups. Both Ki-taek and Dong-ik’s family form their respective habitats based on the space they live in which in turn are reorganized to form their respective ranks. These restructured habitats will ultimately appear in their behavior, language, and attitudes. As a result, spatial habitus has emerged as a major factor that clearly reveals class differences. As can be seen by Bourdieu’s classification of social position and their preferences, Dong-ik’s space, as defined by the ruling class, is able to express his conscious taste with the support of his immense material wealth. On the other hand, Ki-taek’s space, which is at the level of the working class, was based solely on need and put functionality as priority.",김수정,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106950377

버추얼 휴먼의 사실적 표현을 위한 연출 연구 국내 TV 광고를 중심으로,"Virtual humans have emerged around the world and are generating high profits through various means that are viewed as the realm of human acts such as marketing and advertising various brands on commercials, being influencers and celebrities, realeasing music albums, and starring in TV shows. The study will focus on the case analysis of the three virtual human beings <Shinhan Life, Rozy>, <Musinsa, Muayin>, and <Chilsung Cider Zero, LyuID> and compare their similarities and differences by analyzing the directing characteristics of virtual humans. The common feature of the cases is that virtual humans used various directing devices to distract viewers from virtual humans making dramatic facial expressions that emphasize their unnaturalness and awkwardness. All of these cases present common features, such as using colorful camera movements to prevent viewers from focusing on the face of virtual human, or placing virtual humans in the same space as real people so that they can naturally blend inside real people. However, there is a difference in implementation methods for these three virtual humans. Rozy who appeared in the Shinhan Life advertisement and LyuID who appeared at Chilsung Cider Zero have synthesized the face and hair on the body of an existing model, while Musinsa’s Muayin was fully created out of computer graphics. In the case of Rozy and LyuID, they moved in a very dynamic fashion and aimed to add realism and appeal to younger audience by maximizing the physical characteristics that stand out in women and men’s physique. In the case of Muayin, since the whole body is made up of computer graphics, it appears in the advertisement in a much calmer and static manner compared to the two virtual humans above, and tried to pursue naturalness by showing minimal movements and expressions.",김미숙,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108294994
두기봉의 밀키웨이 제작사와 포스트 -1997 홍콩영화 정체성의 문제: 느와르 작가주의와 ‘중국화’(mainlandization) 사이에서,"the most prominent directors working in Hong Kong of the post-1997 era. Amid the prevalence of big-budget Hong Kong-China co-productions he persistently produces the works of Hong Kong film noir, a genre that remains in a somewhat fading vein as not so translatable to the mainland market. His filmography is at once imbued with a highly personal style and a consciousness of Hong Kong society, thereby contributing to his recognition as a filmmaker to help revitalize Hong Kong cinema out of its post-return stasis.
This essay looks at Johnnie To as a stylistically accomplished auteur who draws on the contemporary sensibilities of Hong Kongers, particularly in connection with the following two factors. First, the diversity element of To’s filmography can be attributed to the way he headed Milkyway Production Company since its establishment in 1996. Conceived as a breakthrough to sidestep the mainstream studio system and star system that had dominated Hong Kong film industry, Milkyway was borne out of To’s desire for creative and autonomous control over filmmaking. However, given the prolific body of work that includes commercially-oriented romantic comedies as well as the more auteurist-oriented films noirs, Milkyway’s production model merits an investigation. This demonstrates how To manages to maintain his auteur status by engaging in a tug-of-war between popular and what he calls “individual” filmmaking.
Second, To’s engagement with the maneuver of Milkyway Production needs to be located within the changing landscape of Hong Kong film industry that has been increasingly becoming “mainlandized.” This tendency turned out to be more important when Milkyway found itself within a situation involving the political context of the various censorship issues since it ventured into making Hong Kong-Chinese co-production films from the early 2010s onwards. It remains to be seen whether To’s auteurist sensibilities and his specialty in the film noir genre will be sustainable without compromising too much of the aesthetic style and the characteristics of social themes while also accepting to negotiate through the stringent regulations and limitations laid by the censorship authority in China. The work created by To and his Milkyway production team in the post-return era shows an example of how an independent Hong Kong film company has been breaking through the mainland Chinese market while, at the same time, the conflicts of interest and the reality of translations between Hong Kong filmmakers and Chinese censors still persist.",박은지,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108531977
국내 주요 웹툰 플랫폼 서비스 품질 분석에 관한 연구,"This study analyzed service qualities provided to Webtoon platform users through traditional IPA (Importance-Performance Analysis) and revised IPA, utilizing WebQual (a measure of website quality). There have been only a few empirical studies despite the webtoon service’s impact on the content industry. Given the rapid growth of the webtoon industry, this study seeks measures to facilitate webtoon platforms by figuring out the users’ needs. This study utilizes IPA which is a simple and effective analysis method in analyzing the characteristics of quality from the perspectives of consumers’ importance and achievement. Moreover, this study compares the analysis resulting from traditional IPA and revised IPA and deduces implications to facilitate webtoon platforms. Both traditional IPA and revised IPA have shown that webtoon platform users consider the characteristics of ‘obvious to interplay, and easy to understand,’ ‘easy to use, and contains the latest content,’ ‘provides various fields,’ and ‘provides sufficient details,’ etc. are the most significant.
Users always regard these characteristics as important when using webtoon platforms and should webtoon platforms manage and maintain these characteristics to meet their users’ satisfaction. Furthermore, webtoon platforms should focus on the characteristic of ‘individually customized curation’ service quality which was derived from the revised IPA. The key to webtoon content is a new experience that leads to a new (cultural) taste. Over the years, the number of platforms that provide webtoons with distinctive tastes and attract fans has been growing. Therefore, webtoon platforms should identify their users’ individual characteristics and discovering tastes This study aims to present measures and resources to facilitate webtoon platforms.",성대훈,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108532889
21세기 SF 영화와 포스트휴먼의 조건 -정신과 신체의 인공적 관계를 중심으로-,"The posthuman in recent times is a new being generated from the convergence of human beings and scientific technology and of a major interest in a variety of academic and artistic areas which want to diagnose human future. Being realized with such elements as artificial intelligence, robot, android and cyborg, it is a technical artifact, but it can be regarded as ‘a post-human being’ since it has quite a similarity and kinship with human beings.
SF films in the 21st century diversely express the posthuman being through CGI technology, and therefore raise questions about the border between human beings and nonhuman beings. For example, human life in Altered Carbon(2018) gets out of its fundamental limit of finitude. It is because a storage with which human mind can be extracted, stored and cloned is developed. The AI android robot and bioengineered human in Ex Machina(2015) and Blade Runner 2049(2017) have physical conditions which are not different from human beings, together with thinking abilities, emotional expressions and sympathies which are corresponding to human beings as well. In these mixes of human being’s natural essentials and human created artifacts the distinction between ‘human’ and ‘posthuman’ becomes ambiguous. The prerequisite of distinction is closely related to following questions: Which is the root of life, mind or matter (body)?; Is the ultimate aim of the posthuman the similarity with human beings?; or Does it presume the appearance of a completely different new being through excluding anthropocentricism? This study examines 21st century SF films which deal with the posthuman and then tries to find out answers to above questions in reference to related discussions on humanities and social sciences.",박영석,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105904856

Various comedies have used an effective strategy called parody. However, parody in films (especially comedy) has been evaluated as a film that compiles famous films simply for laughter, it is true. As a result, studies on parody comedy films have not been actively conducted, and of course, studies on Mel Brooks, who fills most of the directing works with parody comedy, including <Blazing Saddle,> the beginning of parody comedy films, are rarely conducted, at least in Korea.
Therefore, I think looking at how parody is used in Mel Brooks’s two leading comedies and how it can be accepted will help us rethink the general perception of parody comedy and redefine his status by bringing back a comedy director we’ve forgotten.
Therefore, in this paper, parody is divided into critical parody and imitation parody based on the parodyist’s attitude toward the original text, and accordingly, Mel Brooks’ two parody films <Blazing Saddle> and <Young Frankenstein> will be divided into critical parody and imitation parody forms, respectively.

Without any exaggeration, the reason why the film <Parasite> is highly praised is its narrative strategy, that is, in the era of global capitalism, it fully reflects the cultural differences between economically polarized classes and social strata. For this, the paper, centering on Greimas’ actor model and semantic square matrix, is to analyze the text of <Parasite>s in detail, and to try to convey the world view according to the narrative structure. In the surface narrative structure analysis, putting the role “Ki-woo” who represents the younger generation in the global capitalist era as the subject, and describing the means of survival his pursues, that is, entering the mansion (where President Park’s family lived), the protagonist have established close friends and family relations (blood community) as a a helper, and ave confrontation with colleagues and employers who have a common relationship as a enemy, which can find out the structure of capitalist society and its problems discovered by the director (Bong Joon-ho) as the communicator of information. In addition, the film is highly appreciated by the international community, so the audience’s evaluation of the film as the receiver of information is also localized globally. In the deep narrative structure analysis, it confirms the opposition between “lower class” and “upper class”, and extracts a positive proposition “belonging to the lower”, a inverse proposition “belonging to the upper”, a negative proposition “not belonging to the lower” and a negative inverse proposition “not belonging to the upper”, through the setting of the object pursued by the subject and the hostile relationship. It also reflects the difference between class definition (the boundary of taste) and ethical definition (the boundary of etiquette), through the significance of the deep narrative structure formed by these propositions, that is, the inequality between the lower and upper classes, the instability of classes and strata, as well as the fierce competition caused by them. I think, the director Bong Joon-ho wants to show us anon parasitic symbiotic society with a paradox way, in this narrative structure.",왕인순,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107326669

Therefore, this study is to analyze the success factors of two movies and to discuss the success possibility of K-zombie movies in the future. A review of South Korean box-office receipts shows that popular movies have generally been based on historical facts relating to the current generation or to an event that could happen in reality. South Koreans experienced the fear of infection as they went through the turmoil of mad cow disease, MERS, and COVID-19. This social and religious environment makes many South Koreans take the subject of zombies as a real possibility.

In the case of the animation support policy implemented by the central and local government agencies, it is necessary to establish a systematic support structure from the initial stage of development so that various high-quality creative works can be nurtured and produced. Additionally, as several OTT platforms have established themselves as mainstream media and have been earning significant revenue in Korea, the legal and business position of OTT platforms needs to be clearly defined through the improvement of related laws and systems. Based on this, we suggest laying the groundwork to boost the Korean animation industry by enacting specific related laws, such as the revised OTT version of the Korean animation broadcasting quota system and the mandatory investment of a certain portion of profits in the Korean animation industry by OTT platforms, as in the case of France and Canada.",박재우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108532882
영화에서 서사 구조에 미치는 색채의 관계연구 - <영웅>을 텍스트로 -,"In this paper, I attempt to examine the influence of colors to narrative on film. Narrative on film is expressed or supplemented by visual factors, not only story. Colors are variously used from screen tone to costumes and items. This is why the film director can richly describe psychology or emotion of character through screen tone, costumes or items. Hero was expressed by narrative which multi-layeredly makes up story, and by colors which go well with each stage. Zhang YiMou described human psychology using many colors. This is a typical example of a work how various colors affect psychological expression of character. This film represented black as death and dignity, red as jealousy and passion, blue as a Utopia and comprehension, white as confrontation and catastrophe, green as fresh and fading, and yellow as an Emperor and righteousness. I intend to discuss Heros colorfully expressed narrative and character`s mind through variety of colors. This is why this film seems to have succeeded all over the world.",강성률 ( Sung Ryul Kang ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75532022
한국 영화의 조선족 재현과 혐오표현의 문제 -<청년경찰> 손해배상 1심 판결을 중심으로-,"Released in 2017, the Korean film Midnight Runners seemed to play on and amplify fears resulting from the crimes of Chosunjoks by utilizing actual places and names in Daelim-dong to create a fictional reality. Reacting to this, residents and Chosunjoks living in Daelim-dong demanded damages from the film production company. The main issue in the lawsuit was that the film strengthened hatred and discrimination against the Chosunjoks. In the first trial, the filmmaker and the director successfully defended their freedom of expression and claimed they could not be held responsible for its unintended effects. Regarding this first court’s judgment, we criticized his main idea in the judgement in that verisimilitude is essential for the promotion of commercial films so that led the filmmakers to use the actual place name Daelim-dong, a major residence area of the Chosunjoks, and to borrow negative images of the Chosunjoks. From the viewpoint of “ethics for others,” the first judgment was only a mechanical judgment, which is very worrisome, considering that more and more diverse migrants will live in Korean society.",한희정,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106333852
한국전쟁기 남북한 만화삐라의 프로파간다 성격비교,"The 20th century was an era of propaganda. Fascist, communist, and even the liberalist camp used propaganda to glamorize the ruling power or ideologies.
Rulers recruited artists to make exaggerated slogans as realistic as possible using propaganda techniques but exaggerated unrealistic portrayals with heroic characters led to unpersuasive images that ultimately failed. During the Korean War, propaganda was still the vanguard of the ideological conflict between the North and South.
Talented artists were force fed Cold War mentality and turned into new propagandists who became hostile towards each other. Propaganda during the Korean War unfolded around comic propaganda bills. Comic propaganda bills were produced under the strict instructions and controls of the superior authorities both in North and South Koreas, but there were differences in the method of expression as well as in the attitudes in using the medium of comics between the North and the South. While South’s comic propaganda bills accepted the artistic expressiveness such as wit, humor, metaphors, etc. of the artist as much as possible and used these elements actively, comic propaganda bills from the North were only focused on depicting the party’s orders accurately and did not expect other factors as comics. Because of such perceptive differences, in the South, comic propaganda bills not only had propaganda effects but became the foundation of the development of the comics industry before and after the Korean War. In this sense, comic propaganda bills during the Korean War period became an extremely useful propaganda medium for the South, whereas comic propaganda bills in the North were quite ineffective as propaganda.
After the Korean War, the collective propaganda sector became more developed and the role of comics was reduced for mainly children in the North. In the South however, the tradition of entertainment comics grew, advancing to a new platform called webtoons. This study will conduct a comparative analysis of the characteristics ofcomic propaganda bills during the Korean War which brought about significant differences in the formation of comics culture in North and South Koreas, and take a detailed look at how propaganda mediums were used during the Korean War by the two countries. The valuable experience gained from the above research has clearly shown that a more superior social system is not an oppressive society that forces artists to produce propaganda, but a society that provides an environment where creativity can be exercised more freely.",이재웅,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106950892
참을 수 없는 <오발탄>의 모호함,"You Hyun Mok’s The Aimless Bullet has been praised to be a representative realism film in Korean cinema history. Considering that the concept of realism was not properly defined among Korean critics, however, it can be said that The Aimless Bullet was misunderstood to be realistic for its progressive theme and story because of the vague admiration for realism at that time. We need to note its modernistic characteristics by way of form analysis which would reveal the physical technique ignored by critics who wanted it to be a realism work.
The Aimless Bullet presents several distinguishing marks different from realism films of classic Hollywood cinemas in its form. The intentional and self-conscious excessiveness of style such as space division, deep focus, formative angle, montages of image and sound, and motif building by repetition makes it to be modernistic or avant-garde.
It was called to be realistic because of the need of its times although it is a modernism film. The valuation of The Aimless Bullet, however, was changed at the end of 90's. With criticism for irrationality of the past beginning, criticism for realism which had ruled started.
The purpose of this paper is to take part in creating a new discourse focusing on the modernistic style of The Aimless Bullet. It is most controversial in Korean cinema history, which shows not that it is a realism film of fixed narrative but that it is a modernism film which is full of ambiguous and symbolic images.",김성희,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76532599
"인터넷소설영화, 그들만의 리그","In the Korean filmdom, scenarizing an internet novel is booming. About ten internet novels are now being manufactured as a movie by an influential and newly emerging film company.
One reason is that it can reduce a risk index as a manufacturer because one-round inspection was already completed by ' the number of inquiry' called click, and another reason is that it is possible to have expectations for good box office in the respect that the consumption bracket of internet novel equals the major spectator bracket of the movie. An internet novel is now being in charge of a role for which literature has been responsible as the subject matter of a movie for decades. These movies show the narrative and the mode different from the existing movies as the internet novels show writing form and technology different from existing paper novels.
It composes daily stories and happenings which are trivial and juicy based on an individual' s experience rather than classic narrative pattern centering on a plot of big event. The contents mainly show teenagers' love and friendship sensuously, vividly and funnily in addition to social issues of the current age through the overturned relation between a man and a woman. As the internet novel shows another world by expanding denotative reality as a role of a prosumer (producer+consumer), even the internet-novel movie is showing another cinematic reality and aesthetics through diversity of the subject matter and a story, with the environment and consciousness of that everybody is a writer and a director. One part capable of filling in the lack of the subject matter and diversity which has been pointed out as a weak point, is just the internet-novel movie, even though the adaptations, the important creative process, depend on the final share of a filmmaker.
A modem movie is reliant on internet and netizen' s fervor which are occupying a position as an axis of center for mass culture. The power of Korean f i is just spurted from a new passage of a story called internet, and from originality and imagination amid it.",전평국,2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A40108761
존즈(S. Jonze)의 SF 영화 <그녀>에 나타난 디지털 매체시대 소통의 진정성 문제와 새로운 가능성 탐구,"New media enables new communication environments and methods. Modern society is rapidly changing from an analog media to a digital media society. In the future society, where digital media is dominant, new forms of communication will emerge, causing various problems and bringing to another possibilities at the same time. In this context, this article will critically examine the form of communication and its authenticity in the digital media era that appeared in S. Jonze’s SF movie Her, and look at the new possibilities of communication. The director presents emotional goods, which express emotions of customers instead, or soothe their loneliness. There are letters of surrogate writers and artificial intelligence dialogue programs. These emotional products make us think in various angles about the authenticity of communication and which expressions of emotions are real or fake. The director also provides an opportunity to get a glimpse on the possibility of new communication through the forms of communication that can appear in the digital media age. At this time, Jones encourages the audience to participate in thinking rather than forcing his own opinions unilaterally. In this regard, the film Her itself is a message and an invitation to ask the audience for a synesthesic imagination and sympathy.",남운,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104304169
"영화에서 빛의 현상학, 그 나타남에 관한 연구","This study examines the relationship between the meaning of light and the philosophical thought in the film through the transition from metaphysical thought to light phenomenon. We will examine how the conversion of thinking about light affects the way of existence of images. In the movie, light has played a role as a symbolic, dramatic, and background effect, whether it is natural scenery or artificial lighting. The metaphysics of light(sacredness, transcendence, the symbol of truth) was the dominant thinking in many films, from silent films to sound movies. Plotinus’ metaphysics and the aesthetics of light in the middle age are situated in this perspective. Metaphysical thought understands light as the fundamental principle of all the phenomena that explain the world. This image of light is regarded as a representative image for the understanding of narrative, and establishes a logical and rational ordering world as a part of meaning system of discourse. However, Dreyer’s Ordet(1955) considers light as a matter of nature and recognizes light as a manifestation of God as light aesthetics, while at the same time explaining light materially and consider a light as a figural. It also splits up the logical semantics of the narrative by imposing contradictory meanings which can not be interpreted as an iconographic method. This explains way in which images of light are not included in the film narrative. Ferrara’s King of New York(1990) reveals conversion of thinking about light in that it perceives light as a material matter, not a mental reality. Light as a material is a physical activity such as wavelength and intensity, movement and diffusion, fullness, void, and permeability, and is a process of movement. Since light is phenomenal, this research is to acquire the analyse the process of light, not semantics. The analysis of the process of meaning reveal the coexistence of heterogeneous images : an iconographic image composed of customary images of the genre, the process of mouvement of images described irrelevant to film narratives, the virtuality of the image, the process of phenomenological(dwell, anxiety, death experience) revealed by the spatiality and planarization of light and by penetrability of light to the body. The material internal movement of light is due to the sudden appearance of non-representative and non-material elements, which can not establish a systematic and integrated discourse, resulting in discontinuity, cracking, and discontinuity. It also reveals the heterogeneous way in which images exist. The heterogeneous way of being is not just coexistence. Heterogeneous images exist in a multi-layered way by supplementing narrative narration, being independent of narrative, anticipating unrealized events, or exposing concealment. Therefore, the way in which heterogeneous images exist can not be defined. This is the way the image exists, and the ‘phenomenology of appearance’ that material images reveal. Research on the phenomenology of light leads to constant reflection on the creative process of film images.",서정아,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104304164
"영화적 시간성: 디지털 문화, 체제 그리고 형식","This paper analyzes the cinematic temporality as a major factor of cinematic specificity in the digital age. Cinematic temporality has long been an important aspect of cinematic ontology and cinema has also represented and constructed temporality in various ways. However, with the advent of digital era, cinematic temporality also has a somewhat different aspect from the past film era. Time tends to be compressed or accelerated, especially in blockbuster movies, which is made easier in logic of digital forms. In addition, the dominant logic of late capitalism can be found in the new senses and tendencies of the cinematic time that the digital regime constitutes. In particular, not only the appropriation of capital for time, but also digital technology systems and forms are redefining our senses through films. This formal logic of digital cinema has been embodied as a specific aesthetic in some recent notable films(<Dunkirk>(2017), <Birdman>(2014), <1917>(2019), <Twin Peaks Season 3>(2017)). These works are inherent in late capitalism ideology and formal characteristics homologous to the logic of digital forms. Therefore, this paper tried to analyze the relationship between late capitalism, the digital regime and film which controls and arranges cinematic time in the digital age, and examines the possibility of new aesthetics and political practice of film.",정지연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108273657
프랑켄슈타인 현상: 근대적인 경험으로서 과학과 인간의 이분법,"The essence of the story of the film Frankenstein (1931), based on Mary Shelley’s novel of the same title, is about Frankenstein’s attempt to create life by combining pieces of the body and the boundaries between science and humanity derived from it. This paper aims to examine the anthropocentricism deeply rooted in modern culture, starting from the dichotomous viewpoint of science and human beings, and further to grasp the social and political meaning of such anthropocentricism. Anthropocentrism was the exclusive to the Western white men, and contributed to the differentiation of different races and genders. The dichotomy between man and science also has an aspect of the ideology of the modern capitalist state. This paper goes further to argue that science, on the one hand, is trusted as a tool for pioneering a positive future for humanity, but on the other hand, distrusted like an uncontrolled maniac. In the 1930s, when the movie <Frankenstein> appeared, it was time for the mechanized industrialization to rapidly reorganize the production site. As the efficiency of production increased with the advent of machines, a new understanding of the value of labor and the rights of workers was needed. Questions such as whether machines can replace labor, if there are standards for distinguishing human labor from the production of machinery, and if so, whether workers fall into machine parts or secure their own and unique areas of labor become prevalent. At that point, Frankenstein’s creation was an appropriate symbolic device, providing a small clue to distinguish humans from machines. This study does not presuppose that human beings and mechanical ones exist beforehand, and attempts to grasp how they define each other while interacting.",김영일,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107002175
