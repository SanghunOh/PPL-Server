
자기 치유로서의 복수극 <더 글로리>,"This paper is the result of analyzing the Netflix drama The Glory, which discourse on the issue of school violence, from the perspective of ‘revenge play as self-therapy’. Based on sociological discussions on the concept and method of ‘literary (art) therapy’, the nature and damage of violence, Moon Dong-eun decided to take private revenge as a legitimate anger and self-rescue, and conducted private revenge as a retaliatory justice. Moon Dong-eun’s private revenge is a tragedy that presupposes self-destruction. However in the process of executing revenge, the process of imprinting the cruelty and seriousness of school violence on the perpetrator’s surroundings and properly expressing his anger that has been suppressed for 18 years is no different from self-therapy. It is also a process of self-therapy that assistants who participated in Moon Dong-eun’s private revenge sympathize with his wounds and pain without turning a blind eye. Therefore The Glory can be said to be a revenge play that mourns the victims of violence by acquiring moral justification and implementing retaliatory justice thanks to the perpetrator who refused to apologize, despite the fundamental limitations of private revenge outside the rule of law. In conclusion it was confirmed that Moon Dong-eun’s private revenge as self-therapy, which began with a righteous anger as a strong emotion arising from the sense of safety of survival, was a literary healing process that encompasses the functions of introspection, comfort, play, and talk. Accordingly The Glory can be evaluated as a text that shows the possibility of literary (art) therapy through the genre of ‘revenge play as self-therapy’. However in order to derive a specific method of ‘literary therapy using dramas’, the process of viewers’ emotional identification of dramatic situations leading to self-therapy through retaliatory justice through private revenge should be analyzed at the receptive aesthetic level. In a follow-up study, the correlation between self-therapy in the drama text and self-therapy through the viewer’s emotional response will be investigated.",윤석진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108729194
예능 콘텐츠에서의 스핀오프 시리즈와 트랜스미디어-tvN의 <신서유기> 시리즈를 중심으로,"The present study analyzed how Korean entertainment content is expanding its world using various platforms through the specific example of New Journey to the West, a major entertainment program by tvN, and the spin-off programs derived from it. Starting off as both a game show and a travel entertainment show, New Journey to the West began creating a variety of spin-off programs as its cast became fixed and its characters became clearer. These featured many different forms, from those that featured the entire cast of New Journey to the West like Kang's Kitchen and Spring Camp, to individual entertainment programs and unit entertainment programs like Restaurant Alone, Winner Over Flowers, 3 Meals For 4, and the Ramyeonator. The world of New Journey to the West is spontaneously expanding in the process of filming rather than as the result of the unilateral planning and production by production crew, with the viewers being able to view this process of expansion. Moreover, the characteristics of the characters become even stronger with the secondary creation of individual and unit entertainment programs based on the characters of the cast created in the process of hosting the program. Thus, the various spin-offs reveal the original work of New Journey to the West, acquiring internal continuity and maintaining their identity despite intersecting with the other entertainment programs by Na Young-seok. As it would be realistically impossible to broadcast these continuously expanding spin-off series on television, YouTube channels were actively used to supplement this issue. In particular, by providing the actual program content on YouTube and the short-form content on television, the series was able to overcome the limitations and demands of broadcasting and scheduling, as well as the pressures of viewer ratings. At the same time, by providing New Journey to the West content on a variety of platforms like Navercast, OTT, and YouTube as well as television, those who enjoyed the content are able to enjoy it via different types of media.",박소영,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108042713
배우의 발성과 극장 공간과의 상호작용 연구,"This essay is a study aimed at the interrelation between performer's vocalization and space of theater. What is vocalization, it is a voice at time of when it is occurred its that performer's breath is to cause of vibrating vocal chords thru throat. This performer's vocalization again is to be conveyed its to spectators thru the giant resonance instrument like space of theater. In accordingly, this performer's vocalization could be conveyed clearly its or not to spectators according to depending on what is consisted structures of theater space. Therefore, this essay is to study in what structures of theater space can be effected its to vocalization.
1st for this, I am herewith to generalize about vocalization to be related to theater space thru reviewing of that how theaters such as from the ancient Greece age' theaters to Baroque age' theaters have come to being developed its.
2nd, I have explored method of developing furthermore today's the architectural structures of to be related to vocalization effectively.
The factual causes being influenced significantly onto performer's vocalization in the architectural structures of theaters are the interior type of theaters, distance of between stage and spectators, stage of dimension and slope of guest's seat, capacity rate and so on.
For examples, in view of today's mainly the proscenium stylish theater, it is embossed its largely because that type of guest's seat are the fan shape and the dead angle happened, there should be considered its such as necessary of setting angles and reverberating vocalization in order to supplement its.
And then it is to suggest that is installing the sound reverberating plate and selecting material quality and so on in order to have effects of reverberating sounds in ceiling and walls of guest's seat above according to dimension of theater as for reverberating sound uniformly. And furthermore, it is because performer's vocalization is moving according to motion of performer that the reverberation of sound shall be reverberated its properly and the musical arrange shall be reverberated uniformly so that this the architectural facts of theater are the indispensable facts.
I am looking over fields of today's theater structures and the effects of vocalization of our nation, most theaters are purposed for using its as object of the multi-purposed complex performing places and becoming trend of stage and guest's seat sized largely, in accordingly, it is not suitable as for performing opera and musical entertainments in actually.
The adjustable-changeable dimension-size of the large stage of theater being devised its for acquiring effect of vocalization are rising it. However, there are also some limitation onto techniques in reverberating sound at the adjustable-changeable type theater, and then there are not formated the properly space of theater for effects of vocalization as before.
Therefore, this essay is to study in the important elements-facts of causing influences to actor's vocalization in course of designing-drawing the performance place and I have come to retracing purposes of the original object in today's constructing the performance place for conveying performer's sound uniformally and obviously.",손정우,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45030293
연기과 개설대학에서의 움직임/신체활동 교과목의 현황분석 및 발전 방안,"This research aims to examine the situation of performance departments in domestic universities in 2010, considering movement/physical activity subjects, the rate of professors who majored in dance, and the contents of their classes, and to present methods for developing and reinvigorating various movement/physical activity subjects by examining the vital points regarding the necessity of movement/physical activity subjects. The roles played by movement/physical activity subjects for performers are as follows. First, they help performers to acquire basic movement abilities, which enable them to express physical perception (the scope of movement) and diverse performances. Second, they help performers to diversely exercise the direction ability for creative motions, acquire experience in developing motions, and improve their ability to connect those motions to the expression of emotion. Third, they seek to promote physical development, as well as the psychological or mental stability necessary for performers. Fourth, they help performers to change their perceptions regarding their bodies. Fifth, they help performers to improve their talents, in order to faithfully carry out the performance for special situations. The methods used to develop such diverse movement/physical activity courses are as follows. First, they must consist of systematic movement/physical activity subjects that are suitable for performers. Second, they should secure professors who can deal with movement/physical activity subjects. Third, they should motivate students to further study those subjects by applying customized professor-learning strategies for performers, and by reinvigorating movement/physical activity subjects by enhancing the preference awareness of these in class registration. Fourth, they should make professors in charge of movement/physical activity subjects keenly aware of the education goals for improving performance ability, while increasing their teaching ability.",배혜령,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100172006

논문 : 사무엘 베케트(Samuel Beckett)의《고도를 기다리며(En attendant godot)》번역본들에 대한 고찰,"Translating any work from one language to another is a delicate operation. This translating difficulties are more true when the translation concerns a work of fictional, artistic value. In translating there are two major parameters that has to be addressed, whether the concerned translation is a type of ``manual`` which should be translated lexically word for word so that there may be no misunderstandings or if the translation concerns a work of fiction be it artistic or non artistic where the translation is mere so in relation with the societal, cultural context rather than being based on encyclopedic translation. The paper addresses four korean translation texts of Beckett`s work En attendant godot. The translation of dramatic texts has always brought about the question as to ``how`` the work should be translated so that the translation recreate the ``esprit`` of the original text on stage. This is especially important when one considers that dramatic texts are to be staged and not just be read. The four translations differ from one another in that one is a translation of an english copy of the french original which was itself translated by Beckett himself, the other three works are different in that two translations are rather translated to simply convey the ideas, significations and symbolizations behind the work itself to the reader mere readily, the last translation concerns itself with rhythmic issues and the minimalism denoted which defines Beckett`s aesthetics while trying to conform to the issues concerning the translation of a dramatic text. The four works that were studied here does not actually give a definite answer as to which style be it encyclopedic or cultural context the translations of dramatic texts should follow. This might be due to the questions as to the aesthetics that the work is subjected to since it is difficult for an average reader or an audience to understand the corresponding symbolization the work is concerned with the translater intentionally tries to dictate or to help with the understanding of the symbolism concerned which in turn turning the dramatic text into a fictional text.",영기찬 ( Gi Chan Yang ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99704829
[고도를 기다리며],"One of intriguing phenomena that dominted European theater in the years after World War II is a tragicomic mode, as we see in works by Ionesco, Genet, Beckett, Pinter, Frisch, and Du¨rrenmatt. We also find a similar trend in the American theater, as in Albee's plays. Actually, Beckett and Ionesco describe some of their plays as tragicomedy (in Waiting for Godot) or tragic farce (in The Chairs). However, the tragicomic mode in their works is closely related to absurdism, as they represent the Theater of Absurd, whose function was to give dramatic expression to the philosophical notion of the absurd. Yet the emphases of Beckett's absurdism are somewhat different from those of Albert Camus, who became a major spokesman for the absurd philosophy with the publication of The Myth of Sisyphus in 1942. This essay thus starts with comparing Camus's absurd notions with Beckett's and contrasting their philosophical attitudes toward life. And we further discuss a tragicomic mode in Waiting for Godot and Beckett's dramaturgy, showing how he parodies The Tempest, one of Shakespeare's tragicomedies, and how he shares the common grounds of Ionesco's absurdist subject matter and repetitive patterns.",손동철,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096587
"이미지, 상상, 그리고 반응 -배우의 상상력과 연기-","Acting is not about action, but about reaction. All the phony exaggerated acting results from self-centered actors` obsession with action without really listening to whatever stimuli are there around them. All the living things, including human beings, are bound to breathe and react as long as they live, which should be reflected into the training of actors and acting. We live our lives without practice. Life is always an improvisation, a succession of reactions made possible by senses and imagination on which each actor thrives. Reaction is preceded by sensory perceptions, which are all images. The imagination compare these images from the senses with those reserved in memory, a reservoir of images, so that the imagination can interpret the images and find any meaning from them. Out of these unceasing processes of imagination, there come out words and behaviors and actions. In that respect, everything that a character does, including thinking and feeling, is a reaction. Memory is like a library with a huge collection of condensed images. Some of these images are prohibited and blocked and deny the access of imagination. For actors, who are compelled to live different lives of characters through their own body and mind, free access to all the images in the library is a must to fully experience and express characters` experiences. Otherwise, his imagination would get crippled and his creation would be only superficial, unreal and untruthful. Without memory, an actor could not see and so he could not respond. No memory, no imagination. Character exists only in lines on the pages of a script. Memory is a soul that an actor must bring to any character he portrays, which makes acting a beautiful art. Any human experience begins with sensory perceptions. The same with characters` experiences. That is why acting should start with seeing, listening, smelling, tasting, and touching imaginary objects so that actors can react. As Declan Donnellan said, ""you are what you see."" When an actor really sees something in the imaginary circumstances on stage, his imagination come to work arduously, which in turn will enable him to become the character without any self-conscious anxieties, without any tension, and without any desire to express. Instead, only is there the freedom of flowing from reaction to reaction.",김준삼 ( Jun Sam Kim ),2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60080126
인지과학의 패러다임으로 살펴본 연기예술의 창조과정과 방법론 연구,"These days, we are witnessing an outstanding scientific revolution called `cognitive science.` Cognitive studies in the fields of neuroscience, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and other disciplines have made a remarkable development in the past twenty years in understanding such cognitive areas as perception, memory, imagination, empathy, emotions, behavior, and meaning-making. In fact, cognitive science is replacing the dominant influences of Freudian psychoanalysis, behaviorism, and semiotics. Scholars in theatre and performance studies are beginning to apply these findings to their field. For the first time in South Korea, I explore the creative process of acting in terms of the new paradigm of cognitive science. In this paper, using the cognitive lens, I look into Stanislavsky`s `system` and Brecht`s `epic style acting` and reconsider the usefulness of the actor training system as one of the ways of establishing the systematic and scientific actor training program in South Korea. In this paper, I introduce the succinct outline of cognitive science in order to engage the readers who are not quitely familiar with it to my study of science of acting. I apply ideas from cognitive science to illuminate the process of acting through the works of such cognitive scientists as Antonio Damasio, Joseph LeDoux, Gerald Edelman, Steven Pinker, George Lakoff, and Mark Johnson. Methodologically, I adopt interdisciplinary approaches to render a more fruitful discussion about Stanislavsky`s system and Brecht`s epic style acting. In this paper, I argue that we should not ignore the findings and discoveries of Stanislavsky`s system and Brecht`s epic style acting due to its old scientific paradigm. On the contrary, I assert, they should be reconstructed from the perspectives and prospects of cognitive science. In the main body of the paper, first, adopting the discoveries and findings from cognitive science, I try to deconstruct the dichotomous division between art/science, body/mind, emotion/reason, consciousness/unconsciousness, inside/outside of the body. After I postulate the cognitive foundation for actor`s bodymind, then, I examine the important conceptual tools of Stanislavsky`s system and Brecht`s epic style acting: character, role, given circumstances, imagination, attention, empathy, projection, dual consciousness, gestus, etc. At the end, I investigate how these discrete acting methods can converge on the troubled issue of the actor`s exploration of creative processes in acting. While I explain these cognitive concepts, I suggest various practical training methods and procedures, which I have tried from the discoveries and findings of cognitive science. Ultimately, I hope that this paper opens up a space for a dialogue about the systematic and scientific actor training programs in South Korea.",이강임 ( Gang Im Lee ),2009,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A76544094
'예술연극' 과 '대중연극'에 관한 쟁점 연구,"Il arrive parfois que l'art the´a＾tral d'un pays, a` une certaine e´poque, manifeste un double de´veloppement daps deux directions diffe´rentes, et qui parfois s'opposent me＾me par leur style et leurs proce´de´s.
Ainsi, dans le milieu the´a＾tral contemporain, le the´a＾tre d'art qui souhaite proposer au public un the´a＾tre de qualite´, coexiste avec un the´a´tre populaire qui privile´gie la quantite´ du public, pour la survivance du the´a＾tre, face a` un parfois obscure the´a＾tre contemporain. Pour certains, la production d'une oeuvre de qualite´ est incompatible avec l'accessibilite´ d'un large public, et pour d'autres, ils s'e´rigent contre l'art pour l'art et lui oppose l'art pour le peuple. Ces derniers conside`rent que la fonction principale du the´a＾tre est d'e＾tre un service public.
Au coeur de mon article, se place cette question : ""Le the´a＾tre d'art, est-il antynomique au the´a＾tre populaire?""
La re´ponse a` cette question pre´suppose la de´finition du the´a＾tre d'art. C'est ainsi que j'ai e´tabli une se´rie de sous-questions auxquelles je vais tenter de re´pondre en parcourant l'histoire du the´a＾tre:
1. Depuis quand existe le the´a＾tre d'art?
2. 'art' en minuscule est-t-il synonyme d'Art?
3. Quelle est la qualite´ esthe´tique spe´cifique au the´a＾tre?
En fin de compte, l'appellation ""the´a＾tre d'art"" est une cre´ation re´cente, qu'il est possible de dater puisqu'elle fut utilise´e pour la premie´re fois a` Paris en 1890 par Paul Fort qui avait choisi ce titre pour de´nommer le the´a＾tre qu'il entendrait fonder.
Les fondateurs du ""the´a＾tre d'art"" ont cre´e´ cette appellation en souhaitant que la ""repre´sentation en tant que spectacle""(ce qui signifie sue ce n'est plus seulement la repre´sentation d'une oeuvre dramatique) soit autre chose qu'un simple divertissement. Donc cette appellation prend une double signification : un concept actif qui accorde au metteur en sce´ne le statut d'artiste initialement refuse´, mais qui conduira parfois a` des de´rives esthe´tisantes ou des de´lires d'autorite´ et en me＾me temps un concept luttant contre le divertissement.
Bref, le the´a＾tre d'art est un concept qui traverse la sce`ne occidentals durant tout le sie`cl et qui espe´re procurer au public une jouissance intellectuelle ou/et esthe´tique. De surcroi＾t on lui promet une e´le´vation au contact du sublime. On cherche a` rede´finir les re`gles de fart selon des valeurs universelles.
Alors, un tel the´a＾tre d'art est-il incompatible avec un the´a＾tre ""grand public""?
Quant au the´a＾tre en ge´ne´ral, il est e´vident qu'il est incapable de conque´rir les masses autant que le cine´ma et la te´le´vision. La conqe＾te des masses n'est pas inhe´rant au the´a＾tre dans la socie´te´ des masse-me´dia.
Pourtant, les expe´riences artistiques de Jacques Copeau pre´sentent un mode`le a` suivre : conque`rir un large public par la seule production d'oeuvre de qualite´. Alors que la concurrence avec le cine´ma et la te´le´vision menace se´ve`rement les the´a＾tres, une formule lance´e par Antoine Vitez, ""un the´a＾tre d'art, e´litiare pour tons"", rappelle que les principes me＾mes du the´a＾tre d'art, contraints d'affirmer davantage sa spe´cifite´, appelle un public tout aussi nombreux.",김효,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096605
유치진의 「 소 」 연구,"This study is intended to see the signification process of the ox in the Ju chi-jin`s `the Ox`, regarding `the Ox` as a text. Previously, though the studies of `the Ox` have various approaches, they share with method which develop the event by character. But really if we closely consider a signification process of `the Ox`, we may find the fact that the signification process of the work by `the Ox` reveals strongly, compared with characters. Therefore, this study is beyond the viewpoints that regard the ox as simple setting, indeed explain that `the Ox` play an agent of problem-solution. In the work, an ox becomes reason-for-being of farmhouse and stand for the identity of a farmer. As event of this work process forwards, the farmhouse collapses lossing a their reason-for-being, and the characters wander deprived from their identity. Then, the objectification-process of an ox is concreted in two level. First, there is a conflict between the agricultural-generation and the antiagricultural-generation appear through a conflect between the father and the son. Second, there is a conflict between the manager of a tenant farms and the tenant farmer appear through a conflect between the ruling classes and the ruled classes. It seems that the conflicts realize broken modernization by Japan in the socio-politic context. At last, the objectification of an ox resulted in the absent of an ox. Therefore, the kuk-seo`s famliy become a collapse and the charaters in the work wander from will. It happen to resolve the problem by an ox, as the ox return to the cage. The deed of an ox work on analogically and such an action lead to the result of returning his cage. That is to say, the through the deed of an ox kuk-seo`s famliy acquire a liveliness again, the characters recover their identity.

This creative work is named the beginning of genuine native musicals for accepting abundantly modern musical style in music, dance, dramatic elements. Besides this product proved the chance of musical as popular art. 《Sweet, Come to me Stealthily》is appreciated as classic of our Korean musicals. First, it is significant to open a new field of Koreanish musical by dramatizing our classical literature. It is able to appeal to the audience because of adapting classical fitted in with Korean emotion for musical model by Koreanish music and dance. For example, the music is rich in Korean colour is contained in Western vessel. Namely, producers designed to get American musical form as well as add on Koreanish atmosphere in material, dialogue, property, costume, melody, dancing etc. Second, Yegreen Troupe laid a cornerstone of the development of Korean musical by cultivating actor and staff through training and instruction.

브레히트와 스타니슬라브스키의 비교,"In diesem Jahr, wo Bertolt Brecht vor 100 Jahre geboren wurden, gab es viele Auffu¨hrungen seiner Theaterstu¨cke und Symposien u¨ber ihn in Korea. Dadurch versucht man die passende Brecht-Rezeption in Korea zu finden. Weil die schauspielerische Methode in Korea mehr auf die auf der Einfu¨hlung basierte Methode Stanislawskis als auf die die Verfremdung betonte epische Spielweise Brechts bezieht, gibt es viele Schwierigkeiten in der Rezeption vom Theater Brechts in Korea. Dadurch ereignen sich ha¨ufig viele Miβversta¨ndnisse bei der Brecht-Auffu¨hrung in Korea. Um diese Miβversta¨ndnissen zu vermeiden, bescha¨figt sich die vorliegende Arbeit mit einem Vergleich zwischen den Theatertheorien von Brecht und Stanislawski.
Im allgemeinen stellt sich die schauspielerische Methode Stanislawskis und Brechts gegenu¨ber. Bei der Gegenu¨berstellung der beiden Theaterma¨nner geht es besonders darum, in welchem Zweck ihr Theater steht. Stanislawski, der im Jahr 1898 das weltberu¨tmte 'Moskauer Ku¨nstler Theater' gru¨ndete, ist ein der wichtigsten Theoretiker wie Praktiker in der modernen Theatergeschichte. Seine mit 'System', gekennzeichnete Theatrmethode gilt als Ho¨hepunkt der bu¨rgerlichen Theatervorstellung, in der es sich besonders um die Illusion im Theater handelt. Im Theater Stanislawskis steht grundgenommen das Gefu¨hl, das als ein wichtiges Mittel des Schauspielers zur restlosen Verwandlung in seine Rolle betrachtet wird, im Mittelpunkt.
Brecht hat die restlose Verwandlung des Schauspielers in die Rollenfigur kritisiert. Statt der Identifizierung des Schauspielers mit der Rollenfigur verlangt Brecht die Distanzierung. Seine schauspielerische Arbeitsweise ha¨ngt unmittelbar mit der materialistisch-dialektische Kunstvorstellung zusamrnen. Er sieht die Aufgabe des Theaters nicht in dem Erleben der Wirklichkeit, wie im Fall Stanislawskis, sondern in der Darstellung der Wirklichkeit. Dafu¨r verlangt er dem Schauspieler die verfremdete Spielweise, mit welcher die gesellschaftliche Bedingungen und die menschliche Beziehungen herbeigefu¨hrt werden ko¨nnen. Diese Spielweise wird als Gestus gekennzeichnet. Im Theater Brechts muβ der Schauspieler spalten und zweifacher Gestalt, d. h. als Zeigender und als Gezeigter, auf der Bu¨hne stehen. Aber nach dem Studium u¨ber die physische Handlung Stanislawskis hat Brecht seine kritische Haltung vera¨ndert. In seiner dialektischen Theaterkunst wird inzwischen die in der fru¨heren Phase festgehaltene rigide Unterscheidung zwischen dem Gefu¨hl und der Vernunft aufgegeben. Anstatt solcher Unterscheidung versucht Brecht die Schauspielmethode zu entwickeln, in der er das Gefu¨hl in der bestimmten Probe der Verko¨rperung der Rollenfigur erlaubt.
Trotz der partiellen A¨hnlichkeiten zwischen Brecht und Stanislawski gibt es noch die Differenzen. Wa¨hrend Brecht auf die Vera¨nderung der Gesellschaft durch das Theater zielt, fehlt es bei Stanislawski solcher gesellschaftlichen Funktion. Die Schauspielkunst Stanislawskis geht u¨berwiegend von der Schaffungsa¨sthetik aus. Daher steht die 'Schauspieler-Kunst' in der Mute seines Theaters. Dagegen ist das Brecht-Theater die von der Wirkungsa¨sthetik ausgegangene 'Zuschauer-Kunst'.
Aber Brecht wuβte den Vorteil des spa¨ten Geborenen zu nutzen. Das produktiv-kritische Weiterdenken von der Schauspielkunst Stanislawskis ist ein charakteristischer Zug des gewandelten Verhaltens Brechts zu ihm.
In unserer Theaterlandschaft ist die Schauspielkunst der beiden Theaterma¨nner theorethisch wie praktisch nicht genug bekannt worden. Die aus diesem Wissensmangel resultierte Gegenu¨berstellung zwischen den beiden kann in Zukunft durch die besseren und na¨heren Forschungen und Diskussionen aufgehoben werden. Damit kann unser Theater von den bisherigen epigonalen Rezeptionen der Schauspielkunst von beiden ausweichen und die fu¨r uns geeignete Schauspielkunst entwickeln.",이상복,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096579
이강백의 '문학성' 과 '연극성' 연구,"""Lee Kang-baek Theatre Festival"" offered an opportunity to consider the literary and theatrical qualities of Lee Kang-baek's plays.
""The Diary of the Trip to Yong Wol"" dramatizes from historical facts the innate desire of human beings for freedom from oppression. The illusionary trips made three times in the play induce the reader as well as the audience to experience the desire for freedom in their rich theatrical imagination. The playwright, however, shuts off the rich theatrical devices of his creation in the play by over-explaining. In addition, the directing and acting which failed to incite the imagination of the audience tumbled the play into a two-dimensional production. It is just for this reason that the production of ""The Diary of the Trip to Yong Wol"", even with its rich theatrical as well as its high literary qualities, will probably be looked upon as a production distanced from theatricality.
The play, ""Feeling, So Heavenly"", is armed with tiresomely repetitive lectures of the playwright, conveying a far more adamant theme than with ""The Diary of the Trip to Yong Wol"". The formal structure of the former play does not demand the rich theatrical imagination of the reader, as with the latter. It is absolutely a 'play of words' filled with the playwright's repeated lectures expressed through the characters' mouths. In other words, the former is superior in literary quality and yet inferior in theatrical quality to the latter. Lee yun-taek, the director of the play, however, manages, to succeed in transforming the excessive abstractness of the play into the surprising concreteness on the stage. His decision of materializing the body and the mind of Buddha by contrasting the actors tinted with gold powder and the actors dressed in stone-colored costumes turned out to be quite effective. The invisible mind of Buddha was clearly visualized through well-trained actors's acting of Buddha. Though Lee's directing damaged the literary quality of the play, it, instead, succeeded in harvesting a high degree of theatricality from the play.
""The Diary of the Trip to Yong Wol"" in the Lee Kang-baek Theatre Festival failed to realize the rich theatrical quality imbued in the play, even with its sincere representation of the play on the stage. In the case of ""Feeling, so Heavenly"" noted for its strong literary quality as a play, however, powerful theatricality was recognized as most distinct quality as a production. Here the matter of directing style is raised for consideration. Lee Kang-baek's plays seem to be more harmonious with the highly stylized directing style like Lee Yun-taek's. because Lee's plays are teeming with unrealistic allegories and fantastic devices. Highly philosophical themes, allegorical situations, and abstract dialogues do not correspond with realistic style of directing as shown in the production of ""The Trip... "" Lee's plays demand highly stylized style of directing as shown in the production of ""Heavenly ..."".
The ""abstractness"" of Lee's plays is often indicated as a drawback antagonistic to theatricality. In actuality, however, it can be viewed as a virtue particular to Lee's plays which opens a new sphere of perception and introspection. The playwright Lee is unique among the Korean playwrights in his tenacious efforts to delve into spiritual world-invisible, superhuman, supernatural, and infinite. The real drawback of Lee as a playwright is not in his abstractness but in his persistent lecturing aided by the abstractness, with which he places the audience in a narrow confinement of strict themes. This drawback gives fatal damages to the literary quality of his plays and hinders easy conversion of the literary quality into theatricality. If Lee discards his lecturing attitude, his plays will have more intimate and fruitful contact with the audience. If Lee's plays induces more positive stylization from directors with more flexible openness, the high level of literary quality in his plays will experience a harmonious communion with new theatricality.",김미도,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096585
한국 경찰영화의 서사 관습과 경찰이미지,"This study explores the representation of cop and its social implication in Korean cop movies since '90s. In order to do so, this study analyzed the narrative structure of eight most popular cop movies since '90s. The analysis revealed that these movies have developed through three narrative types. The first type depicting cop as an economically disadvantaged individual identifies cop with powerless working class in a capitalist society. The second type which describes cop as a working class hero penetrates deeper into Korean society by addressing not only economic issues but also the general system of society. In this type, Korea is a harsh place where the law of jungle prevails that cop has to survive only on his physical strength and tenacity. The third type brings the systemic failure of Korean society already implicated in the second type to the surface by depicting cop as failing working class. In this last type, cop ultimately fails to save innocent citizens from criminals, tearing down the myth that cop brings balance to the chaotic society. Through these three narrative types, Korean cop movies have been resonating with Korean audience, identifying cop with working class.",권선영,2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100172021
"한국 현대 연기에 있어서 전통적 요소의 수용과 모색 -탈춤사위의 도입부터 ""한국적 연기의 원리""까지-","This article traces the history of acting in modern Korean theatre and focuses on its efforts to adopt the indigenous theatrical mode of presentation. The cultural efforts started in the 1970s as part of new theatre movements that attempted to incorporate some elements of traditional Korean performing arts. It also coincided with a paradigm shift that tried to make a break with westernized theatre styles, in general, and western realist acting techniques, in particular. Ho Kyu and Son Jin-Chaek were primarily responsible for creating a new style of acting based on local dramatic traditions. They founded Minye Theatre and sought to bring its productions closer to the spirit of traditional pansori and mask dances. For this task, they trained their actors and actresses to embody the spirit of cultural consciousness in their performances. Their effort was significant as they continued to discipline them with a sense of mission, that is, a traditionesque approach. From the 1970s to the 1980s madang emerged as a showcase of Korean folk performance with very explicit contemporary political messages. It sought to establish an indigenous acting philosophy which was different from that of western conventions. In other words, it tried to recapture, by means of such devices as direct audience address, a projecting stage as opposed to the proscenium-based performance spaces, the free-and-easy interaction between performers and audience that characterized madang plays. Today, many of these innovations have become standard practice in the performance of little theatres. Meanwhile, Yu Duk-Hyung and Ahn Min-Su at the Drama Center and Kim Jung-Ok at Jayu Theatre began to experiment on the basis of western experiences with Asian bodily movements rather than seeking to establish only the Korean style. They claimed that such Asianness in their movements are intrinsic in the Korean body and consequently they tried to represent it in the performances of meditation, impromptu and collective creation. Oh Tae-Suk too believes that every Korean embodies the Korean structure of feelings in addition to his or her own movements and rhythms. However, in each individual performance, Korean practices and language are considered more important than the abstract concept of movements when they are associated with the process of characterization. He also stresses the importance of practice to speak actor`s actual lines based on the traditional rhythm. Since the early 1990s, Lee Yun-Taek has systematized the Korean way of teaching acting by embracing Korean sound and bodily techniques and also by returning to the way of breathing that can be found in Korean folk performances. The Korean way of movements and breathing, as he describes, result from a natural breathing process that involves the storage and release of air stored in the pelvis. As such, there have been numerous attempts to adopt the indigenous theatrical mode of presentation. Unfortunately, however, their efforts haven`t converged on one direction and such diverse ways of achieving the common goal don`t necessarily mean `progress`. Rather, their efforts can be classified into three distinct categories. First, the effort to position Korean theatre in an advantageous relation to the traditional has been renewed by those practitioners who cherish the great traditions of local culture such as pansori and mask dances. This group can thus be called diachronic historians who stress, more than anything else, actor`s bodily discipline in order to learn indigenous techniques. Second, there is also a group of people who try to re-establish Korean way of acting on the model of western theatre tradition. This approach necessarily sees local theatre from the global perspectives and consequently there is a danger of Orientalism, although it can be effective in the age of globalism as a common denominator for the global culture. The final approach is similar to that of Eugenio Barba whose anthropology of theatre empha",김방옥 ( Bang Ock Kim ),2006,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A75386982
몸의 연기론(1),"Acting assumes various aspects these days in Korean Theatre.
Diverse terms of acting such as 'psychological acting', 'interior acting', 'physical acting', or physical training became familiar with many actors of Korea. Recently so called 'body acting' is taking a growing interest between theatre people.
From the historical point of view, the body acting of today is the result of the efforts to surmount the dual view of acting: to see man and his acting as a mind/body duality. This paper intends to review the history of mind/body duality of acting and to examine the attempts of harmonizing them.
The paper printed here is the first half of the entire paper.
Frequently acting has been explained in terms of body/mind or somewhat like exterior/interior duality. This corresponds to the traditional view of human being in Western culture.
The history of acting can be interpreted as a rivalry between mind and body; The argument such as 'Does mind control body?' or 'Is emotion or body technique a essential part of acting?' were the focuses of interest.
The history of the mind/body acting can be traced back to Platon who adhered to Idea and Descartes who believed firmly in human reason. Diderot, the philosopher of the 19th century, and Coquelin, the actor of the same area solidified the dual nature of acting. They all believed reason controls body and emotion.
Entering 20th century, 'the method' of Lee Strasberg, which intensified the psychological aspect of Stanislavski's system acting, also consolidated body/mind duality of acting.
On the other hand, the efforts to mitigate the conflict between the two and to pursue a harmony between them have been exerted throughout the 20th century.
Until recently, Stanislavski system has been misunderstood as a psychologically oriented acting system only to emphasize to such elements as inner truth or emotional memory. But as his theory of physical action being rediscovered, he began to be revaluated as to initiate a psycho-physical acting.
Artaud, Grotowski, and Barba, the representatives of modem nonrepresentational acting stressed the physicality of acting. They groped for hardly trainned, well-scored body with appropriate inner support. For this, they found body-mind, the harmonization of body and mind is inevitable.
Phillip Zarrilli, encountering traditional Asian acting, pursued body-mind unity in a deeper level, to recognize the psycho- physiological acting. Bt controlling breath and stimulating breath circulation, a real harmony of body-mind is achieved and as a result, a large amount of creative energy can be produced.
Since this breath control named 'ki' or 'dan' is familiar with Korean People, A Korean director Lee, Yoon-taek, for example, adopted the psycho- physiological acting as his method to enhence creative power, energy, flexibilty of body and mind of his actors.
Western acting seems to have been traveling a long time to settle in body-mind acting. However, from the perspectives of view of non-Western, or Korean people, body-mind harmony is quite natural, eventhough they experienced the age of a 'distorted' Stanislvskian, phychological acting for sometime around the middle of the 20th century. Now they come to realize that a mature acting is based on a mature view of human being.",김방옥,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096637
"오류에서 진실로, 죽음에서 삶으로 -《오이디푸스 왕》에 나타난 눈의 이미지 연구-","La trage´die de Sophocle, <(Edipe-Roi> est une pie｀ce essentielle dans la culture occlture occidentale et nulle pie｀ce grecque antique plus qu`(Edipe-Roi n`a e´te´ traduite, adapte´e et repre´sente´es en Core´e. La fable oedipienne pose la question essentielle. L`histoire d`(Edipe permet d`inte´grer les diffe´grer les proble｀mes ge´ne´alogiques en re´flechissant sur la question centrale de l`inceste et en inte´grant les cas de figure le´gaux et structurels de la famille-cite´. C`est aussi une pie｀ce d`un re^ve terrible, avec lequel (Edipe Roi est urgent de vivre et de savoir la ve´rite´ malgre´ tout ce qu`il de´voile. Mais nous avons parfois oublie´ les e´le´ments fondamentals de cette pie｀ce et les aspects esthe´tiques. Si l`espace antique permet une distance ou un rejet, il est ne´cessaire de relire cette pie｀ce avec une autre proble´matique qui autorise I`interpre´tation de prises de position the´orique. L`inceste, le parricide, l`adoption, la de´construction et la reconstruction du principe Pe｀re dans des poe´tiques particulie｀re, date´es par le the´a^tre tragique sont des notions qui ont a｀la fois une pe´renite´ et une histoire. En fait, les re^ves de cette pie｀ce sont d`une tragique re´alite´. C`est pourquoi il est imposible de re´duire cette pie｀ce a｀une simple de´monstration de la mise｀re de l`homme. Cette de´marche m`a donc conduit a´ mettre au primier plan de cette lecture l`image du l`oeil. Dans cette e´tude, j`al voulu relire cette pie｀ce avec l`image de l`oeil et distinguer entre l`erreur et la ve´rite, entre la mort et la vie, entre le passe´ et le pre´sent de la trage´die, entre les intenitions et les actes. Pour cela, j`ai reconstitue´ dans cette e´tude la signification de cette pie｀ce a｀travers les notions langusitiques de l`oeil et de la relation entre la pie｀ce dramatique et l`oeil. et puis j`ai de´montre´ de toute e´vidence que les efforts de l`homme pour e´chapper au destin voulu par les dieux n`aboutissent a｀rien. Mais pour (Edipe qui est le roi malheureux passant de l`inconnu proble´matique au terrible connu, la solution finale est de perdre une partie de son corps pour atteindre la ve´rite´. C`est justment la perte de l`oeil pour enque^ter sur sa vraie nature. En fait il est devenu un aveugle. Le seul reme｀de a｀la ve´rite´ qu`(Edipe a fait, apre｀s bien des re´flexions, c`est de ne pas voir le monde visible. L`image de l`oeil est d`un vrai de´bat sur les fondements de tout le´gitimite´ qu`il est ici question, celle de la me｀re, celle du fils, celle de pe｀re, celle du roi et celle cle Dieu. Certes, les hommes ne peuvent pas saisir la ve´rite´ du monde avec l`oeil. Sans l`oeil, (Edipe est donc a｀la fois la nature du gouvernement et le renversement de la nature humaine.

II est l`aveugle-clairvoyant. Dans cette pie｀ce, l`aveuglement, figure majeure de la fable, est l`image vers laquelle tout converge. (Edipe a du^ savoir et s`aveugler.

E . 고든 크레이그 연구,"By the beginning of the century E. G. Craig was regarded as one of the greatest innovators in theatre. His contribution to the modern mise en scene is indisputable, and his concept of the director's role in the theatre has aroused passionate responses. His actual achievements have become obscured in the arguments, but a knowledge of his work is vital to understanding the way twentieth-century avant-garde theatre has developed.
This study makes a survey of the available documents on Craig's concept of directing as space-design, as visual construction of stage. These allows to reevaluate Craig's significance as director. Craig aspired to build a scene by means of drawing-a scene where magic and symbol (as visible essence of the theatre) merge. So his work can't be taken to be merely a superficial scenic reform in which suggestive simplicity covered with a veil of light or darkness the clumsy literalism of the naturalists' tasteless parlour. And his attempts in stylized stage-design were only improvements-inspired by English Symbolism-on W. Nicholson's style. Craig leamed new media and techniques of artistic expression and new ways of looking at the theatre.
Craig considered the stage a metaphor, made up of the organized interaction of visual elements. Defining the stage as the visible sign of an idea, he claimed that scene design is the very essence of the theatre. the result was that he took-instead of realistic settings-the huge curtains and brought them to light in full size, and using a cyclorama on an almost bare stage, he achieved an impression of vast space, impossible to do by cluttering the stage and using lower curtains. In fact, he applied to the stage the teachings of the Symbolist and Impressionist painters, treating the stage as pure material and exploiting its specific properties. This is also how he treated light, using it to paint the settings, to indicate time, and to create mood. the quality that had made scenery dramatic in the eidophusikon was movement, and Craig put this together with his reduction of architecture to its essential elements. So when he began to work out the basis of Scene, his definition was that it shall be of solid form, of three dimensions, and moveable.
Throughout this illustrated analysis of Craig's design work this study relates the influential theatrical theories, such as On the Art of the Theatre and Towards a New Theatre, to Craig's own production between 1900 and 1912 and his later visionary conceptions.",남상식,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096640
동래야류 현대 전승사 자료 비정,"Half a century has passed since Korean Mask Play, Dongnae Yaryu was reenacted in 1965 and designated as an Important intangible cultural property. In the meantime, It contributed to the establishment of national culture. Some of the testimonies do not fit the reality, causing serious problems in conveying the history of tradition. Therefore, the purpose of writing this thesis is to criticize and correct the errors in the record.
The correct transmission history of Dongnae Yaryu is summarized as follows. In 1965, Chung Sang-bak, the writer, planned and gathered performers at the request of Busan Metropolitan City. And by practicing and directing them, he participated in the 6th National Folk Art Contest and won the highest prize, the Presidential Award. As for the principle of reenactment, as far as possible, the natives of Dongnae played happily as they remembered without interfering. The financial support from the city of Busan was used for all expenses. Dongnae Yaryu performers won the top prize at the 6th National Folk Art Contest.
Subsequently, Choi Sang-soo was in charge of the designation as an Important intangible cultural property. He ended his investigation by interviewing 3-4 performers, rather than performing a performance by a native who remembers the two scene of the play, Yangban, Halmi and Younggam. And he submitted a report that recorded 4 scene of the play as he had recorded in the past, and received deliberation and had it designated as Important Intangible Cultural Property in 1967.",정상박,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108729190
연극에서 문화상호주의적 접근방식의 문제점 - 피터브룩 ( Peter Brook ) 의 << 마하바라타 Mahabharata >> 공연을 중심으로,"The theme of interculturalism, and especially the relationship between the theatre of the Orient and the Occident, has become a matter of major critical and performance interest in recent years. Through out the theatre history from Voltaire to Brecht Oriental theatre has been a source of inspiration to Western theatre artists. But the East was not permitted to speak for itself, the West provided the Eastern voice or voices it desired to hear. Peter Brook is the most celebrated theatre artist in the Western world. He also ispired from the Orient. He has gone beyond the simplistic debate about Orientalism, as theorized by Edward Said. His most publicized production is Mahabharata. Evidently, his Indias do not exist, or rather they only exist as his artistic creation. Indian theatre has been grossly mythologized and taken out of context. The root of all of the misundertandings about intercutural theatre are apparent in the work of this director. His theatre is not ethnological, folkloric or touristic. Roger Long pointed out that Brook`s Mahabharata bring (him) no closer to understanding how Asia and Western theatre can be successfully fused while retaining the essence of both. Brook work on the representation of the other is primarily a formal and professional kind, rather than authentic reproduction. He appeals to what is imagined unites all culturs, and this common vision is presented by traditional Western concept. To criticize such productions for failing to speak with the authentic voice of India is thus to place upon them an expectation quite incompatible with his goals. The creator`s aim focused on transcultural rather than intercultural. Without denying the artistic achievements his production really bring us no closer to understanding how material from two cultures may be fused while preserving the essence of both. The risks of transcutural enterprise ramains that the initiating culture imposing its own value systems upon others in the name of human brotherhood and universal concern.",명인서(Inn Seo Myung),2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096657
