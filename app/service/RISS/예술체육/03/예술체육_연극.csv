This investigation focuses especially on the reception and transformation of Oedipus` myth in Sophokles` Oedipus the King, and it will show how great and unique this drama turned out to be. Compared with Sophokles` Oedipus the King, Homer`s Odyssey 11, 271-280 did not further develop motives, such as children of incest, self-punishment in terms of blinding oneself and expulsion from the city of Thebes. Such motives only became fully developed in Greek Tragedy. Following the motives of the Thebaid epics, indeed, Aeschlylos repeated those motives, such as the family curse and the role of the Furies in his Theban trilogy, Laios, Oedipus, and Seven against Thebes. But the poet introduced the children of incest motive to dramatize both the mutual destruction of Oedipus` two sons and the downfall of his royal family. On the other hand, the fate of Oedipus` royal family, especially in Seven against Thebes, was dramatized to signify the rescuing of the city state. Sophokles transformed Oedipus` myth not in the dramatic form of a trilogy, but in the condensed unit of Oedipus the King; he did not dramatize the whole complex of the downfall of Oedipus` royal family, but rather highlight Oedipus` tragic fate. Furthermore, in dealing with an Aeschylean plot pattern Sophokles invented a new plot pattern, i.e. error - recognition - self-determination to dramatize not only the main theme of Oedipus the King, the limitations of human knowledge, but also to portray Oedipus` heroism. The theme of the limitations of human knowledge was intensively dramatized by the poet`s use of dramaturgy, such as the confusion of one and many, tragic irony, and tragic dialectic. Despite its overall emphasis on the theme, Oedipus the King gives the impression that Oedipus, the incarnation of historie(""inquiry""), comes to transcend the limitation of human knowledge through his heroic self-determination. This leads to a paradoxical reconciliation of opposites through concepts, such as suffering and knowledge, progression of human knowledge and religious belief, and tradition and innovation. Accordingly, Sophokles seems to send a message of reconciliation to the conflicting political positions in the city state of Athens.",김기영 ( Kee Young Kim ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879124
양극성 장애 회복을 위한 마음챙김 적용 연극치료 - 20대 여성 개인 사례를 중심으로 -,"This study aims to qualitatively analyze the recovering process of a bipolar female subject through an individual case of mindfulness-applied drama therapy. To achieve this goal, we first examined the subject’s characteristics and the mindfulness-applied drama therapy program, then analyzed the observed process of change. For the successful therapeutic program, relieving the subject’s analytic attitude was the first thing to accomplish. In this phase, drama therapy, which induces projecting through utilized stories, was relatively more effective than mindfulness meditation. We were also able to note that the ‘Top-Down Approach of Drama Therapy’ was more effective in opening herself up emotionally than the ‘Bottom-Up Approach of Mindfulness Meditation’ due to the extremely cognitive disposition of the subject, signifying the importance of harmonizing and balancing both ‘bottom-up’ and ‘top-down’ approach to maximize the synergy. Through drama therapy, the subject displayed an attitude change in 3 aspects: ‘self-acceptance’, ‘family relationship’, and ‘romantic relationship’. It was especially the subject’s process of finding honest insight and acceptance regarding her relationship with her parents that became imperative for recovery. As a result, the subject’s tendency improved from analyzing and censoring herself to placating and accepting herself for the way she is. In conclusion, this study signifies the effectiveness of the mindfulness-applied drama therapy through a bipolar subject’s recovery process and offers a method of clinical extension for both drama therapy and mindfulness therapy.",백소미,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108638658
가족이라는 레트로토피아 ―텔레비전드라마 <응답하라 1988>을 중심으로,"A Television drama didn't deal with the sensitive political and social problems of 1980s, and therefore failed to reflect on the dark side of the society at that time represented by the 1988 Olympics and etc. In this drama, the efforts to look beyond the alley of Ssangmun-dong were given up, and all meanings and values were given to a family. That's why the main motive of the previous series, ‘finding the husband’, relatively didn't stand out compared to the previous work. Yet, in Eungdabhara 1988, a certain distance was kept from a patriarchal family based on the division of labor by gender. In the drama, a father's authority had become weak and a mother's right to speak had been strengthened. Moreover, beyond the division of each family, communal solidarity as a kind of pseudo-family was emphasized. However, in this process, a devoted mother's role in a family was more stressed out, and a pseudo-family was also concluded to become reborn into a real family through marriage. Therefore, the alternatives from the past found in this soap opera while facing the reality where the existence of a family itself is in danger are only empty.",백소연,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106377117
스타니슬랍스키 연극론에 있어서 배우와 역할의 관계,"This study reviewed ‘System’ suggested by Stanislavsky and “Creating a Role” written by him, in order to look into Stanislavsky’s thought on the relationship among actors, roles in a play and roles to be played on a stage. “Creating a Role” was not completed by Stanislavsky but by editors after his death. There are differences in times when each chapter was written and also in the author’s attitude and opinion toward the creation of a role. In the early years he emphasized that actors should dam up and control their feelings, and maintained that they should define the essence of emotion and should grope for actions to bring out it. In later years, however, he proposed ‘the method of physical actions’ based on imagination and improvisatory acting, suggesting that it should come before what actors analyzes a play and their roles. Even so, they are little different in the attitude toward plays and ways to create a role based on the actor’s physical activity and experience and to feel the play. Stanislavsky maintained that performing arts should be centered on creative actors, and his thought led to a study on the system. He wished actors to have experience of existing as their roles on the stage. Of course, he did not hope to get rid of the boundary between actors’ own selves and their roles on the stage. He particularly stressed that actors should be immersed in their roles but at the same time should be aware of themselves as actors. Actors are not characters on the stage. Actors comprehend their roles and lead their lives on the stage, and at the same time, they are subjects who control their roles consciously. Stanislavsky believed that without actual experiences, actors could not make the characters come to life on the stage. Such experiences are what he wanted to gain with the method of physical actions. In this regard, an actor should be an actor as well as a controller; specifically, an actor should completely go into the character and act the character so as to communicate them to the audience. Herein lies the artistic completeness of which Stanislavsky dreamed.",이진아 ( Chin A Lee ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879328
정연두 다원예술의 창작 원리 -매체 특정성의 포월(匍越 )을 통한 매체의 재창안-,"In this article, I examined the creative principle of Jung Yeondoo's works, which are understood as inter-disciplinary art through Krauss's post-media discourse. Especially, it focused on his work of expanding the exhibition of the art museum to performing arts. In relation to it, I analyzed the first solo exhibition of Jung Yeondoo, Borama Dance Hall(2001) and his major works after that to explore how the potential possibility of being composed of performing arts was embedded by ‘post-’the media specificity of photography art. DMZ Theater(2021), which was combined with the total of such potentials to subsume-transcendency(포월) by ‘post-’the media specificity and create new aesthetic effects; that is the reinventing the medium. In DMZ Theater, the medium that constituted the exhibition worked as the element that constituted the performance; photographs, images, and formative objects were related to the body of the performer and created the effect of performing tourism. The inter-disciplinary art that presupposes the pluralism can not be explained like this; it fused with each art genre and their medium not hierarchically but democratically. Jung Yeondoo's work can also be understood as a inter-disciplinary art in terms of reinventing the medium beyond the medium specificity in the mode of subsume-transcendency(포월). Beyond the hybridization of art genres or the expansion of media due to digital technology, art media in the analog era can be reinvented as a new medium through digital technology. However, in order for the method of reinventing to become ‘art’ rather than pluralism, the creator's self-consciousness is required to reflect on what the meaning of art is and what the meaning of art work is. For Jung Yeondoo, it is to realize someone's dreams and memories through art and to restore the value of the forgotten experience of the social community.",김기란,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108041166

The specific focus of this research is to examine the case of drama therapy conducted through the broadcasting media and explore its implications.
To achieve this, the therapeutic value implied in the TV program <My Precious Child: Modern Parenting> as well as its narrative structure and therapeutic factors in drama therapy, were examined. Based on this foundation, the analysis of the case revealed that drama therapy facilitated emotional catharsis and promoted self-awareness among the participants. These therapeutic factors were found to be effective in facilitating psychological and relational changes among the participants. However, it is important to acknowledge that broadcasting media cannot ignore viewership ratings. Therefore, drama therapy facilitators may face psychological pressure to bring about therapeutic changes in participants within a limited time frame. Despite this challenge, the therapeutic process showed similarities to clinical settings.

만화 원작 TV 드라마 연구,"In these days, there are many creatures based on the original cartoon. The cartoon has been regarded as the very low quality of entertainment business. Since ""공포의 외인구단"" written by Hyun Sae Lee, the points of view have been changed a lot and become popular among people. This factor is influenced in making various pictures based on the original cartoon. It also has been affected in TV drama business as well. In recent, there are various strategies to generate the high profitable media business in terms of using from the very low cost of cartoons so called ""One Source-Multi Use"" concept for game, film, broadcast, performance industries and so on. Although the various activities in entertainments business, there is very little progress in researching cartoon business and rare to research the cartoon text. For example as ""Full House"" and ""Palace"", I would like to raise issues which we have to consider dramatizing the original cartoon into drama. In cartoon, the characters are mostly stereotypes and the story is based on the very simple plots/conflicts. There can be allowed to abbreviate and a leap of imagination but in drama, it`s more focused onthe reality rather than imagination. If a drama describes or tells the whole story just like a cartoon, it could be very difficult to persuade or transfer the original propose to audiences. Due to these reasons, we have to put the characters more realistic, the plot is more complicated, more conflicts between characters, and more coherent story.",남승연 ( Seung Youn Nam ),2007,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879126
놀이로서의 연극,"En attendant Godot de S. Beckett est considere comme theatre d’absurde ou anti-theatre representatif. Dans ce theatre, le plot et le theme ne sont pas clairs et le deroulement de l’histoire est ambigu. Le coq-a-l``ane de deux personnages, deux passants etrangers et le Garcon qui parle de Godot font un drame. Il n’y a pas de commencement, ni deroulement, ni fin, mais il y a seulement le devoir d’attendre quelqu’un inconnu. La presentation dramatique que les personnages montrent est ressemblante au jeu d’enfants. L’action des heros est presque proche celle d’enfants. Conversations d’insanite, farces, mises en boite, et pertes de la memoire dans cette piece sont-elles des caracteristiques du jeu? Si nous voulons lire En attendant Godot par la notion du jeu, nous devons comprendre exactement la notion du jeu. Le jeu qui est considere traditionnellement comme negatif depuis la philosophie de Platon, s``illumine de nouveau dans le domaine de l’esthetique chez Kant. Alors, en saisissant une signification philosophique et culturelle du jeu de notre temp, nous allons le mettre pour l``instrument de l’analyse d’En attendant Godot. Quand on regarde En attendant Godot par l’angle du jeu, nous pouvons elargir l’horison du theatre d’absurde, comprendre a neuf des actions absurdes des personnages et le sens de Godot. Deux hypotheses sont possibles, si nous apprehendons cette piece absurde dans le point de vue du jeu. Premierement le theatre d’absurde signifie le theatre anti-aristotelicien. Ce theatre comme un rite pour le culte dionysiaque, vise au celui original compose par la desordre et l``anti-regle. Deuxiemement, il signifie l’anti-raison et l’anti-science. Selon Huizinga, ce theatre s``oppose a l’idee bourgoise et au theatre realiste. L’adulte qui joue comme un enfant est un etre d’absurde. Vladimir et Estragon sont des personnes qui incarnent l’absurdite. L’homme absurde est alors tragique? ou bien negatif? D’apres Lanson, ce n’est pas toujours comme ca. Par le plus grand des hasards, l’homme absurde est positif et un possesseur de la conscience raisonnable. Par exemple, Camus montre l’homme absurde en dessinant des confrontations entre le monde irraisonable et la raison de l’etre humain dans ses oeuvres. Puis il y montre un modele de l’homme absurde qui veut decouvrir la bonheur a la fois en confirmant une condition de l’homme et en sentant avec finesse la rupture entre le soi et le monde. Chez Camus, une seule chose que l’homme peut faire se revolte contre cette absurdite du monde. Qui est Godot? C’est la question la plus repetee dans la piece de Beckett. Mais avant cette question, nous devons poser d’autre question; ne pas savoir l’objet d’attente, ne pas savoir la fin d’attente et seulement le fait d’attente est clair, qu’est ce que cela veut dire? Si nous considerons En attendant Godot comme un jeu, cette question peut se denouer facilement. D’ailleurs, nous avons besoins de poser des questions sur le sujet, le moyen et le but du jeu. Dans la mesure ou la scene d’En attendant Godot est une presentation, non pas une representation, nous devons mettre les personnages presents sur scene au point, au lieu de la personne imaginaire(Godot).

자폐스펙트럼장애 아동의 화용발달을 위한 DvT 연극치료모델 집단 언어치료,"This study concerns theatrical group language therapy based on DvT model for children with ASD. We describe and discuss the working process and results. The purpose of the study is to develop pragmatic skills of participants, especially social interaction, turn-taking, and symbolic play. The program contains 10 sessions. For the first two session, the program focuses on sensory-motor activities such as gestures, vocalization, auditory sensation, and touch. For the following sessions, the program focuses on the role-play and synthetical activities using yellow chair, sound effects, and lighting effects. In the beginning of a session, the activities were gestures, vocalization, and auditory sensation. In main activities of the session, the participants played theatrical activities. At the beginning of this work, participating in activities was difficult for the ASD children, because of their behaviors such as crying and going away from the activity room. However, their negative behaviors were gradually attenuated, they are desensitized of sound and obscurity, and finally the participants could do their role-play. Although this program adopted the DvT model, we just reached to somewhere between the sensory-motor stage and pre-operational stage, not a mature stage because it was a short program of 10 weeks. Nevertheless, the fact that they could do their role-play shows a kind of symbolization on the fictive and symbolic space.",배희숙 ( Hee Sook Bae ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879347
논문 : 사무엘 베케트(Samuel Beckett)의《고도를 기다리며(En attendant godot)》번역본들에 대한 고찰,"Translating any work from one language to another is a delicate operation. This translating difficulties are more true when the translation concerns a work of fictional, artistic value. In translating there are two major parameters that has to be addressed, whether the concerned translation is a type of ``manual`` which should be translated lexically word for word so that there may be no misunderstandings or if the translation concerns a work of fiction be it artistic or non artistic where the translation is mere so in relation with the societal, cultural context rather than being based on encyclopedic translation. The paper addresses four korean translation texts of Beckett`s work En attendant godot. The translation of dramatic texts has always brought about the question as to ``how`` the work should be translated so that the translation recreate the ``esprit`` of the original text on stage. This is especially important when one considers that dramatic texts are to be staged and not just be read. The four translations differ from one another in that one is a translation of an english copy of the french original which was itself translated by Beckett himself, the other three works are different in that two translations are rather translated to simply convey the ideas, significations and symbolizations behind the work itself to the reader mere readily, the last translation concerns itself with rhythmic issues and the minimalism denoted which defines Beckett`s aesthetics while trying to conform to the issues concerning the translation of a dramatic text. The four works that were studied here does not actually give a definite answer as to which style be it encyclopedic or cultural context the translations of dramatic texts should follow. This might be due to the questions as to the aesthetics that the work is subjected to since it is difficult for an average reader or an audience to understand the corresponding symbolization the work is concerned with the translater intentionally tries to dictate or to help with the understanding of the symbolism concerned which in turn turning the dramatic text into a fictional text.",영기찬 ( Gi Chan Yang ),2013,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99704829
한국영화검열사의 몇 가지 주제에 대한 시론적 연구,"This paper has a goal to examine several issues of history of Korean film censorship research, and by this seeks a new direction. To this end, this paper attempts to describe some topics that have been overlooked in that field, have not received much attention compared to their importance, or require re-thinking. The first is who is talking about censorship. Until the Korean Film Archive open censorship documents to the public, the most basic material in the censorship research were testimonies, especially of film directors. But testimonies conducted by an artistic and self-conscious author, who is not a direct party to an administrative censorship, are at risk of conveying inaccurate information, distorting of the entire censorship system or exaggerating damage. This paper will discuss this issue by comparing the testimony of the director with the censorship documents in the case of Choehuui Jeungin(The Last Witness). The second relates to the criticism of the tendency to understand the nature of censorship as limitation and deletion only. The most important issue in recent censorship studies is the productivity of censorship(or productive censorship, constitutional censorship). In this article, I will examine some cases focusing on how to see the productivity of censorship in Korean film history. The third is to examine the relationship between the censor and the censored, and the personality of the censor, based on the testimony of Lee Namki, who was responsible for censorship in the Ministry of Culture and Public Information in the 1970s.",조준형,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105271330
"1990년대 한국 텔레비전 드라마의 변천과 <질투>(MBC, 1992)의 위상","Jealousy is a new style of television drama in the 1990s and acquires historical meaning. Unlike previous television dramas, Jealousy was evaluated as new by presenting a light relationship beyond melodramatic development. In addition, it was pointed out both novelty and limitations in that it reflected the consumption culture as it was while actively appearing in the work. However, it should not be missed that behind the love narrative of Jealousy is the drama creation period of the main character's mother. It can be seen that the original novel and the perception of the genre of 'trendy drama' introduced from Japan are complexly linked here. Therefore, it is necessary to look at the problem consciousness that Jealousy is taking in the original novel, and to look at the self－consciousness that it has as a television drama. It adds to the concern about a relatively new format called 'miniseries'. Through this, it is possible to reconsider the allegations of plagiarism against Japanese dramas that have been continuously raised by Jealousy. In terms of including the status of popular narratives transitioning from novels to television dramas, Jealousy already shows the peculiarity of Korean television dramas.",임미주,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108505631
SF영화(science fiction films)속 생태주의,"SF movies that deal with future society based on relations between science and human, than other genres` movies, stand on ecologism`s subjects at the front side or present modem cognition and the reverse functions that are based on Ecologism.

In this way, Blade Runner are based on modem reason of ecologism`s start as human anxiety and fear of existence living in unecologic environment, and structure of the ruling class and the controlled class by dichotomous classification of the spirit and the body. And it show metaphorically that the original loss of the post industrial society could be caused by human oneself not the outside things of human. Science make man-made men and anthropocentric thinking justifies relation of control between human and man made men naturally, but movie approach human nature through man-made men who are more human than original human.

"재난, 아카이브, 이미지: 재난 기억의 문화적 실천","Beyond the apocalyptic events that mostly take place in the distant future, disasters are now in the midst of present life. Disaster is no longer a narrative, but a reality. This paper seeks to examine the political and aesthetic issues of how to record and remember disasters, as well as critical awareness of the disaster reality. This question leads to the following issues: Whose and for whom does the archive of social disasters and disasters contain memories? How can we imagine the political aesthetics of disasters so that the record of disasters can be an open image in the future's imagination beyond the current state of events centered on the identification and action? This paper aims to discuss the cultural practice of disaster memory by juxtaposing the instances of a disaster archive that actively utilizes various archiving practices and the works of a 21st century archive documentary that newly approaches social tragedy and disaster trauma. Considering archive fever embeded in the archive's modern history, the artistic work of archiving disaster memories has a special meaning of mnemonic practices. The paper argues that the characteristics of the disaster archive include the community of collective memory, the archiving practice of mourning, the place-specificity of the disaster archive, and the aesthetic experiment of affective memory. The second half of the paper looks at the filmic work of contemporary cultural artists who actively use disaster memories and archives to create new images and to remember the problems or disasters of our society from a new perspective. In particular, contemporary Korean documentary films dealing with the 2019 Yongsan Tragedy are remarkable in that they are approaching disaster memories by actively utilizing media footage and experimental devices.",박현선,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106917807
한국여성국극연구(1948~1960),"Korean classical opera of women is derived from Korean classical opera, however, it became performing art with more elaborated and spectacular stage and set. It started right before the war started and then it disappeared suddenly after the 10 years of the period of prosperity. Because Korean classical opera of women was more focused on performance than so-ri (a traditional narrative song[ballad]), it could be fully supported by public. Based on its characteristic, Korean classical opera of women matched to public taste and that brings the result of development of Korean classical opera of women. These points made Korean classical opera of women became best grosser of the market at that period and also it firmly finds its place in the field. One of the reasons of development of Korean classical opera of women was the situation that time period faced, which is war. It was one of the way to escape from miserable reality. Another reason of development was caused by the fantasy of deviating from paternalistic society. With these ideas above, Korean classical opera of women that had its own strong place for itself, in 1960`s, it falls into a decline. There were reasons for its decline and that is there were no actresses who was specialized in Korean classical opera of women, was not able to find new repertoire, did not find out how audience`s urge and taste changed, movie and television boom, error of system that has absence of education in Korean traditional music and popularity of its genre. Especially Im Chun-Aeng`s Korean classical opera of women was able to flourish, because it satisfied an era`s desire.

〈햄릿〉의 드라마투르기적 분석,"Der Begriff Dramaturgie verweist auf die Beziehung zwischen Text (im weitesten Sinne) und Auffuehrung. Die dramaturgische Analyse bezieht sich sowohl auf den Bereich der Produktion als auch auf den der Rezeption, so dass die beiden Bereiche Text und Auffuehrung mehr verstehen und sich auf ihre intellektuelle Hoehe der thearralischen Praxis situieren koennen. Fuer Hamlet gibt es in der Rezeptionsgeschichte eine Vielzahl von Lesarten, Ueberserzungen, Interpretationen, Bearbeitungen sowie unterschiedlichen Gestaltungen. Deren Grund liegt in der ""Instabilitaet der textuellen Ueberlieferung"". Das dramaturgische Konzept dieser Fabel ist durch das ""revenge-pattern"" bestimmt, das in drei Spiegelsituationen auf Parallelhandlung auftaucht; Hamlet, Fortinbras und Laertes. Jeder von ihnen handelt als Raecher seines Vaters. Jedoch geht es in Hamlet jenseits der Rachetragoedie urn den breiten Themenbereich der von Hamlet beruehrten Felder Rache und Rerechtigkeit, Schuld und Suehne, Staat und Koenig, Schein und Sein, Verstand oder Wort und Tat, die verschiedenen Vorstellungen des menschlichen Handelns. Shakespeates bewusste Dramaturgie des Stueckes ist ""den Gegensatz zwischen Hamlets Untaetigkeit und konventioneller Aktivitaet auf der Buehne deutlich machen"". Daraus ergibt sich, ""dass die Gestaltung des delay die Crux und den Reiz des Stueckes ausmacht"". Das Konzept der Tragoedie ist, dass der Protagonist zoegert, start zu handeln. Dafuer setzt der Dramatiker an Stelle des Handelns die besonderen Handlungselemente: Monologe, stop-action technique, double doubt, Spiel im Spiel. Hamlet ist Shakespeares laengstes Stueck. Besonders konzentriert sich das Stueck auf die Hauptfigur, die ""rund die Haelfte des gesamten Textes"" spricht. Die Konzentration richtet sich nicht nur auf die Hauptfigur, sondern auch auf Raum und Zeit. Die raeumliche Enge der Burg in Helsingoer symbolisiert die Sicht des Hamlet: ""Daenemark ist ein Gefaengnis.""(Ⅱ.2.243) und unterstreicht Hamlets Passivitaet fuer die ""tragedy of inaction"". Die Figurengruppen sind in zwei Familien geteilt: die Familie des Koenigs und die des Polonius. In dem Verhaeltnis des Personals ist erne ""starke Vernetzung"" angelegt. Die Besonderheit der Redeformen des Stueckes ist die Solorede. Fuer den Sprachstil schafft Shakespeare den Blankvers als Klangfigur und die Bildersprache als Sinnfigur. Durch die Intensitaet der Sprache Hamlets gestaltet Shakespeare ihn als eine pychologisch vielschichtige Figur. In den gesarnren Handlungen srellt sich das Theater-und Shauspielhafte dar, indem jedes Handeln der Wirklichkeit entweder ein wahres Sein oder ein Schein wie ein Schauspiel sein kann.",이인순 ( In Soon Lee ),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879142
이근삼 희곡의 서사성 연구,"As the contents of ""Gungmul It Sa Ob ni Da"", it is focused on tragedy of a man who is struggling and drive himself to despair rather he accept social change to be absolute truth than accept it is changeable. It images such a contradiction as like he lost really important things following the stream of time or is selected in society being unconscious of social trend at last. But he is focused on rather describing the problematic situation than possibility of changing which such society should be changed necessary. That is, it just shows problem and even it`s doesn`t have possible optimistic view which the problem can be solved in the end. Therefore, ""Gungmul It Sa Ob ni Da"" has double-edged view those are one of pessimistic and circular reasoning outlook on the world which is nothing changed though society can be reformed, and another of accept possibility of social change taking epic dramatic technical which is reasonal and critical. On the other hand, it is regarded that a man will be under the another pressure without changing on the existing pressing society system although this world will be changed.

Diverse terms of acting such as 'psychological acting', 'interior acting', 'physical acting', or physical training became familiar with many actors of Korea. Recently so called 'body acting' is taking a growing interest between theatre people.
From the historical point of view, the body acting of today is the result of the efforts to surmount the dual view of acting: to see man and his acting as a mind/body duality. This paper intends to review the history of mind/body duality of acting and to examine the attempts of harmonizing them.
The paper printed here is the first half of the entire paper.
Frequently acting has been explained in terms of body/mind or somewhat like exterior/interior duality. This corresponds to the traditional view of human being in Western culture.
The history of acting can be interpreted as a rivalry between mind and body; The argument such as 'Does mind control body?' or 'Is emotion or body technique a essential part of acting?' were the focuses of interest.
The history of the mind/body acting can be traced back to Platon who adhered to Idea and Descartes who believed firmly in human reason. Diderot, the philosopher of the 19th century, and Coquelin, the actor of the same area solidified the dual nature of acting. They all believed reason controls body and emotion.
Entering 20th century, 'the method' of Lee Strasberg, which intensified the psychological aspect of Stanislavski's system acting, also consolidated body/mind duality of acting.
On the other hand, the efforts to mitigate the conflict between the two and to pursue a harmony between them have been exerted throughout the 20th century.
Until recently, Stanislavski system has been misunderstood as a psychologically oriented acting system only to emphasize to such elements as inner truth or emotional memory. But as his theory of physical action being rediscovered, he began to be revaluated as to initiate a psycho-physical acting.
Artaud, Grotowski, and Barba, the representatives of modem nonrepresentational acting stressed the physicality of acting. They groped for hardly trainned, well-scored body with appropriate inner support. For this, they found body-mind, the harmonization of body and mind is inevitable.
Phillip Zarrilli, encountering traditional Asian acting, pursued body-mind unity in a deeper level, to recognize the psycho- physiological acting. Bt controlling breath and stimulating breath circulation, a real harmony of body-mind is achieved and as a result, a large amount of creative energy can be produced.
Since this breath control named 'ki' or 'dan' is familiar with Korean People, A Korean director Lee, Yoon-taek, for example, adopted the psycho- physiological acting as his method to enhence creative power, energy, flexibilty of body and mind of his actors.
Western acting seems to have been traveling a long time to settle in body-mind acting. However, from the perspectives of view of non-Western, or Korean people, body-mind harmony is quite natural, eventhough they experienced the age of a 'distorted' Stanislvskian, phychological acting for sometime around the middle of the 20th century. Now they come to realize that a mature acting is based on a mature view of human being.",김방옥,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3096637
거울의 거울* -현대 드라마의 자기반영성과 미메시스의 확장-,"What epic theatre and theatre of the absurd which revolutionized modern drama have in common is a double mirror that reflects the subject’s act of mirroring along with the object mirrored. This paper examines the emergence and development of ""self-reflexivity"" characteristic of modern drama, tracing the theoretical genealogy of mimesis, and reads the metatheatrical reflexivity as a mode of modern mimesis. Starting from the theory of mimesis founded by Plato and Aristotle, this study analyzes the discussions on drama’s mimetic mirror in neoclassicism, realism, theatricalism, and poststructuralism, and shows how self-reflexivity is a dialectical outcome from the interactions of sociocultural context and aesthetic creation. The self-reflexivity in drama is an aesthetic form “precipitated” from the modern consciousness about the theatrical nature of social relationships and human identity. The mirror of modern drama shifts its primary concern from the verisimilitude of the outer world to the inner world of individual human being, then eventually to the way the drama itself exists, highlighting the autonomy of its own. The double mirror on the stage disturbs the symbolic action of the subject's conscious mirroring, and the text with weakened narrative function gradually changes into a free play of signifiers, turning the drama into a representation of the theater, not the world.",최성희,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108041169
문화도시와 문화예술교육 간 상생에 관한 탐색적 연구 - 강원 문화도시를 중심으로 -,"The purpose of this study is to examine the context in which the cultural city project and the base-building support initiative for local culture and arts education were promoted in connection with three cities of Gangenung, Chungcheon, and Wonju in Gangwon province. It aims to explore what kind of synergistic impacts have been manifested in the process of linking the two government’s initiatives. Based on an explorative case study method, the research findings provided the evidence that the experience of connecting cultural city and arts education projects go beyond the technical parallel promotion. It presents not only positive policy synergy effects for the realization of cultural cities, but also contributes to exploring new values of local arts education. The five findings derived from the research results will be able to provide some crucial policy implications not only for other cultural cities concerned about local arts education ecosystem beyond Gangwon province, but also for arts education practitioners in the field.",최보연,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108534193
무대 뒤의 목소리와 무대미술가의 자기 인식―아르코예술기록원 소장 무대미술가 구술자료를 중심으로,"This study aims to shed light on the activities of stage artists who have been marginalized in existing theatrical history narratives, to reveal the aesthetic contributions of stage artists in the 1960s and 1970s, considered a turning point in Korean theatre, and to shed new light on the landscape of the theatre scene during this period, based on the oral histories of Choi Bokyung, Yang Junghyun, Byun Changsoon, and Lee Byungbok. They position themselves as ‘performance artists’ rather than ‘stage technicians’, emphasizing their professionalism and fighting against the low perception of the performing arts through narratives about their independence from the theatre company or director and their creative contribution to the performance. There is also a sense that they are part of the current trends and challenges of Korean theater, which is the search for what is Korean. While the oralists who worked on costumes and staging share a common emphasis on the fact that their work was a creative process based on images and symbols, rather than a reproductive process of realistically creating a “setting,” they also present distinct aesthetic perspectives, which allows us to examine the direction of the modernization of tradition in Korean theater since the 1970s. To understand the unique features of their works and perspectives, one must examine their performances or the aesthetic foundation of the works in conjunction with plays and directing and examine them in a three-dimensional manner.",박미란,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108579323
드라마의 교육 방법적 활용 방안 모색,"In 2011, Seoul metropolitan office of education has launched educational drama program which helps teachers teach their subjects with dramatic methods. This attempt reflects a trend that educational drama is rapidly booming nowadays and gives rise to deeper discussion of drama as a learning medium. Specially, the employment of dramatic method is done mainly in primary school so that it remains as simple mechanical applications of dramatic conventions. Hence, dramatic method for acquiring complex concepts is demanded. In this context, this study suggests Heathcote`s process-centered drama which is regarded as a method to encompass a wide range of meaning making. In Heathcote`s process-centered drama, three- layered meaning can be produced: meaning coming from identification; meaning coming from distancing; meaning coming from metaxis. Having included a variety of meaning making, Heathcote`s process-centered drama is appropriate for middle and high school curriculum. Besides, this study provides the principle of process-centered drama which is emotional engagement and critical detachment. To embody this principle, devices are listed: living through drama, interest and consensus, teacher-in-role, finding connection, critical reflection and self-spectatorship. The outcome of application of Heathcote`s process-centered drama into middle school classroom is persuasively positive. Therefore, this study suggests Heathcote`s process-centered drama as an effective learning medium for understanding complex concepts. Emotional engagement and critical detachment are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the process-centered drama.",김주연 ( Joo Yon Kim ),2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879296
대중의 욕망과 드라마적 재현,"This study is originated from accepting the result of existing study that Su-Hyeon Kim`s achievement of drama has been supported a lot of viewer`s sympathy and positive response from the narration strategy which is accepting the composition of ``Genre VS genre`` thoroughly. However, the point of this study is not simply repeated the result of advanced research. Through this narration strategy, it is trying to reveal how he had his own individual territory in the popular culture, and how his strategy interact and reveal the meaning in the popular culture. The important thing in hers narration strategy is ``the preoccupancy of issue and new social-cultural agenda-setting``. Such thing is remarkable in writer`s attitude or ability showing dramatic representation of homosexuality. This is meaningful in two points. First, this repetition and bending of genre custom discriminate hers drama from the other writer in the same genre. Through this, it makes writer`s unique color, ``Kim Su-Hyeon label Drama`` and gets a chance of making the viewers get together in front of TV. Second, hers dramas have a huge will of proofreading the public hobby and educating a specific issue. This is the way the writer`s sincerity is communicated directly to the viewers by representing character`s inner outer experience in detail in drama. Sincerity means the sincere and honest vision or attitude of artist which is able to represent the live cross section of reality, and that means a specialty of these works.

책임과 정의: < 세일즈맨의 죽음 >,"This study is to investigate the individual responsibilities and social justice in Death of a Salesman. Raising issues which are central to the American consciousness, Miller writes about success and failure, guilt and betray, and most importantly, about love and responsibility in this social tragedy. On a general level, all of Miller``s drama attempts to create a better society by exploring the demands of morality, and uncovering important individual and social needs. His thematic concerns would be issues regarding responsibilities and connection, the damages caused by capitalism and materialism. Meaningful, for his social tragedy, means a life which takes on both individual and social responsibility, and actively participate in trying to make the world a better place. Death of a Salesman is about Willy Loman``s life and death and his failure to make his dreams come true in a capitalistic society and his own misguided dreams aggravated by the society. Willy had accepted ideas of material success, and therein lies his tragedy. He lacks the sense of the real, the ability of self-adjustment to new circumstance, and social morals. He is himself responsible for his failure in the business world. His downfall and final defeat illustrate not only the failure of a man but also the failure of a prejudiced way of life. But though Willy is destroyed in the process, he is motivated by love and his death allows us to learn the importance of true values. Through Willy``s sacrifice, Biff is able to accept his father``s love, but recognizes the emptiness of the dreams willy left. He gains self-knowledge. Miller asserts that our society and its values have to be changed to be right and moral.

연극 공연의 창발성(Emergenz),"Allgemein wird mit Emergenz ein Phanomen bezeichnet, welches plotzlich neu auftaucht, ohne dass es vorhersehbar ist. Obwohl sich fur die emergenten Erscheinungen nachtraglich eine gewisse Erklarung finden lasst, konnen sie vor ihrem ersten Auftreten nicht vorausgesagt werden. Der vorliegende Aufsatz zielt darauf, dieses emergierende Phanomen im Theater zu beleuchten, und gliedert sich in folgende drei Teile. Der erste Teil beginnt mit einer Vorstellung des Emergenzbegriffs und diskutiert ihn, wie er bei Achim Stephan aus unterschiedlichen vorangegangenen Emergenztheorien zusammenstellt worden ist und damit unter dem Aspekt des Verhaltnisses zwischen der Mikro- und Makrostruktur weiterhin auseinandersetzt ist. Fur Stephan sind am Begriff der Emergenz vor allem die Unterscheidung zweier großer Aspekte von Interesse: Schwacher Emergentismus und starker Emergentismus. Zwei wichtige Eigenschaften, die die beiden voneinander unterscheiden, sind die Irreduzierbarkeit des emergenten Phanomens und dessen Unvorhersagbarkeit. Beide gehoren zu den grundlegenden Merkmalen allgemein geltendes Emergenzphanomens und spielen zugleich eine entscheidende Rolle fur die theatrale Emergenz. Zweitens wird der Modus der Wahrnehmung und die Emergenz der Bedeutungserzeugung anhand der Untersuchung von Erika Fischer-Lichte behandelt. Daraus lasst sich schließen, dass die Performativitat des Theaters dessen Emergenz verstarkt. Damit fordert die Emergenz des Theaters den spezifischen Modus der Wahrnehmung heraus. Diese Wahrnehmungsmodi veranlassen bei den Zuschauern das Erleben spezifischer Bedeutungen, die nicht von der Buhne her einseitig vermittelt werden mussen, sondern die ihrerseits emergiert werden konnen. Die Ko-Prasenz zwischen dem Akteur und dem Zuschauer als bemerkenswerte mediale Eigenschaft fur das Theater ermoglicht eine weitere Erscheinung der Emergenz im Theater. Aus der Mitwirkung zwischen den Akteuren und den Zuschauern, also deren Wechselwirkung und Selbstorganisation in der Mikroebene des Theaters emergiert jede Situation und der Verlauf der Auffuhrung als Makroebene, welche ebenfalls weder geplant noch kontrollierbar sind.",김정섭 ( Jeong Sub Kim ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101879325

치유의 드라마에서 주체와 객체의 관계 연구,"Le theatre qui consiste en mouvement, espace, vie, histoire, jeu du role, peut etre considere comme l’art de guerison. En particulier, le theatre d’aujourd’hui sert directement de la therapie en mettant le focus sur l’insistance du rite, sur la deviation et la liberation produits par le festival de Dionysos. Par exemple, Moreno greffe une fonction de theatre sur la therapie psychologique pour le psychodrame, le ‘forum theatre’ de Boal qui a nomme son theatre la repetition de la revolution attire l``attention comme le drame de guerison. En plus, Le ‘playback theatre’ de Fox represente sur scene directement par les acteurs en ecoutant l’histoire de l’un des spectateurs est egalement considere comme un excellent drame de guerison. Le theatre-therapie use intentionellement des caracteristiques du drame pour la guerison. S. Jennings branche le theatre sur la therapie en fixant les yeux sur les attributs du rite du theatre. R. Landy se modele les roles dramatiques typiques en etudiant des pieces dramatiques classiques. Il offre une base theorique sur le jeu de role employe souvent dans la psychologie. Sauf cela, on travaille sans cesse pour l’exploitation des moyens du theatre-therapie propre de sa culture dans le monde. On va nommer arbitrairement le ‘drame de guerison’, psychodrame, playback theatre, forum theatre and theatre-therapie. Ce drame de guerison a de points communs; sujet-therapeute, objet-participant. Par exemlpe, dans le psychodrame, on peut se deviser en directeur et hero ; dans le forum theatre, en joker et public; dans le playback theatre, en dirigeant et parleur; dans le theatre-therapie en theatre-therapeute et participant. Bien sur, on est capable de substituer leur rapport au metteur en scene, l’acteur et le spectateur. En plus, il est tres interessant de voir ce que le drame de guerison a communement le trait distinctif de la creation collective et du theatre improvise. C’est peut-etre qu’ils sont des meilleurs processus pour que l``inconscient peut s’exprimer en dehors. En meme temps, ils sont etroits avec la forme du theatre primitif.

의무적 삶으로서의 군대와 탈영에 대한 소고 -드라마 를 중심으로-,"The drama <D.P.> depicts the reality of the military, which has been tabooed in the drama scene of South Korea, in the viewpoint of ""desertion."" This paper analyzed the meanings of desertion, which is a keyword of the drama, based on its reproduction of the military in the viewpoint of an obligatory life.
Chapter 2 looked into the reasons of deserters for their desertion in relation to the military culture and discussed exhaustively the meanings of teams to arrest them. Soldiers decide to desert when they feel an existential crisis due to the violent/control life of the military. In this sense, <D.P.> presents desertion as an escape from a life to suppress and destroy the subject. Being subordinate to the obligatory life of the military just like deserters, the teams to arrest them are forced to play the role of returning them back to their old world that they escape from. This shows that the military continues to exist through the vicious cycle of repeated desertions and arrests.
Chapter 3 reviewed the meanings of desertion in a social aspect and examined its limitations and prospects. Deserters have an encounter with a militarized society that is just like the military even after they escape from the violent/control military, which is revealed in other characters and situations as well as deserters. Even common members of society exhibit a pattern of accepting and following a militarist order. <D.P.> discloses a catastrophic reality with no exits and implies that neither escape nor revenge can be an alternative. It is embodied strategically in a stepwise process based on the attributes of OTT drama, and not only are problems that have been born for a long time still unresolved, but they lead to a very pessimistic outlook that they will remain so in the future.
These discussions leave a theoretical question about making the military an obligation. Season 2 of <D.P.>, which is to be announced later, is garnering attention for its ways of embodying this problematic consciousness. There will be hopefully more attempts to reproduce the reality of the military so that there will be ongoing reflections on the South Korean society and the military.",박상완,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108634922

공연예술 콘텐츠의 온라인 유통 방안에 대한 연구,"Technological progress in the era of the 4th industrial revolution has an overall effect on the art ecosystem. In particular, the digital media platform is emerging as an important topic in the mediation area in the process of production and consumption of art after COVID-19. The production, distribution, and consumption of art content riding on online digital technology is gradually expanding through the platform. It is still in its infancy, but it is gradually expanding rapidly. This virtuous cycle structure has a great impact on the performing arts world as well. The attempts of new online-based performance styles and changes in delivery methods are also a fresh stimulus for the performing arts world.
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the video of a performance and the use of a digital media platform will also change the role of the local cultural foundation. Local cultural foundations implemented culture and arts policies for the enjoyment of local people's art and the activities of artists, mainly offline. Today's digital media platform is a new challenge. This study is a study on various attempts and directions to prepare the online content foundation of local cultural foundations in the environment of non-face-to-face performing arts.
As a first step, we examine the current state of damage in the performing arts sector due to COVID-19 in terms of performance volume and region. And we look at the response policies of art-related public institutions.
In the second stage, we analyze the attempts of a performance imaged in a non-face-to-face environment. It is an analysis of the possibility of a video performance where digital technology is applied and the performance meets the audience in a non-face-to-face manner.
As a third step, we examine how performing arts operate on digital media platforms. First, understand the increasing use of digital platforms in non-face-to-face personal spaces after COVID-19. And the change of communication mode and dependence on digital platform are analyzed. We look at the expansion trend of the distribution of performances based on digital platforms. We compare OTT platforms of domestic and foreign large OTT platforms and public culture and arts related institutions.
As a fourth step, we examine the online infrastructure establishment policy of the regional cultural foundation. Using eight regional cultural foundations as data materials, the analysis is focused on operating channels, access trends, and major business contents. And it analyzes the online content expansion and digital transformation policies and implementation projects of the regional cultural foundations that are currently being implemented.
The regional cultural foundation is preparing an interactive ecosystem for art production and art consumption through a digital media platform, and is entering the stage of preparing the environment for the acceptance and development of new art forms. It provides opportunities for challenging experiments to art producers and provides a platform for art consumers to participate in active art activities without time and space restrictions.
In early 2020, the activities of the local cultural foundation were contracted and temporarily transformed due to COVID-19. New changes in the production of works by artists and the activities of local residents in the theater industry have been an opportunity to rethink the role of the local cultural foundation. Now, the use of digital media platforms has become a necessity rather than an option.
Regional cultural foundations need to establish online-based policies in consideration of the purpose, nature, and direction of their respective establishments, and should extensively review methods such as expansion from existing platforms and establishment of integrated platforms. Specialized content is required while performing its own role, and the philosophical basis for digitalization must be considered.

연기 교수법 모형 개발 연구 -낯섦(Uncanny)의 관점으로 본 배우의 현존에 대한 고찰 Ⅰ-,"This study is aimed at proposing a new perspective on acting methods by reinterpreting the meaning of ‘actor’s presence’ presented by Post-drama. Especially, it is based on the philosophical discussion in terms of the concept of ‘unfamiliarity’ that began with the Freudian theory, ‘Uncanny‘.
Firstly, this study tries to derive a fundamental understanding of the ‘actor’s presence’ of Post-drama from focusing ‘a new perspective’ that led to transition of the era. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the Freudian theory of unconsciousness caused radical cracks in numerous ways of thinking that humans had always believed to be true. It provoked not only raising a question about laws and system governed by human consciousness, but also being emerged a new point of view that the truth can exist even in invisible. As a result, theories that are immersed in the reality of ‘truth’ in various aspects have drawn attention.
In the process of these chronological change, Freud argued that the sense of Uncanny in humans is not unfamiliar, but rather ‘fear’ that occurs when a familiar object feels the opposite. In particular, Lacan and Bart continued to expand the concept of ‘Uncanny’ based on the ‘Post-Subjectivity’, confessing from various angles that ‘unfamiliarity’ is involved in the moment when humans perceive ‘now, this moment’ on their own. This study has judged that their arguments on ‘unfamiliarity’ were representative examples to confirm that humans chose a new perspective to face the reality of uncertainty by completely breaking away from the thinking system of Cogito, which had pursued absolute truth. Accordingly, under the premise that the fundamental thinking of art centered on ‘narrative’ until modern times is the first proposition of Cogito, this study tries to derive a clear meaning for ‘actor’s presence’ that is still considered ambiguous under the influence of Post-drama by reinterpreting the specific cause and logical basis of that a new art after the 20<sup>th</sup> century has utilized the strategy of ‘unfamiliarity’ based on de-centrality.
Secondly, based on the above argument, this study tries to prove the effectiveness of acting methods that deals with ‘actor’s presence’. Since the theatrical forms that emerged in the 20<sup>th</sup> century began to reject narrative, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the previous methodologies based on realism. In particular, after the appearance of Post-drama, the art of acting has also undergone a comprehensive review to reflect on the fundamental significance of not only the human body and energy but also the exchange with the audience. As a result, the actor has been placed on a new position as a person who has to directly experience the rediscovered ‘now, this moment’ centered on relationship with the others. This means that the perspective of the art of acting has changed from the fictional characters in the play of narrative to the relationship between a existent performer and humans, including the audience. Furthermore, the actor has reached a point where she/he should clearly recognize to be in a completely ‘different situation’ as the source of communication and the person who has to exchange a sense of ‘presence’ with others at the same time.
In this context, this study has judged that the interpretation of ‘actor’s presence’ in the contemporary philosophy and art that led to modern era could be applied to various acting methods under the premise that the ‘actor’s presence’ in Post-drama differs from the actor’s will power or consciousness.",김경아 ( Kim Kyung-ah ),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108662635

The factual causes being influenced significantly onto performer's vocalization in the architectural structures of theaters are the interior type of theaters, distance of between stage and spectators, stage of dimension and slope of guest's seat, capacity rate and so on.
For examples, in view of today's mainly the proscenium stylish theater, it is embossed its largely because that type of guest's seat are the fan shape and the dead angle happened, there should be considered its such as necessary of setting angles and reverberating vocalization in order to supplement its.
And then it is to suggest that is installing the sound reverberating plate and selecting material quality and so on in order to have effects of reverberating sounds in ceiling and walls of guest's seat above according to dimension of theater as for reverberating sound uniformly. And furthermore, it is because performer's vocalization is moving according to motion of performer that the reverberation of sound shall be reverberated its properly and the musical arrange shall be reverberated uniformly so that this the architectural facts of theater are the indispensable facts.
I am looking over fields of today's theater structures and the effects of vocalization of our nation, most theaters are purposed for using its as object of the multi-purposed complex performing places and becoming trend of stage and guest's seat sized largely, in accordingly, it is not suitable as for performing opera and musical entertainments in actually.
The adjustable-changeable dimension-size of the large stage of theater being devised its for acquiring effect of vocalization are rising it. However, there are also some limitation onto techniques in reverberating sound at the adjustable-changeable type theater, and then there are not formated the properly space of theater for effects of vocalization as before.
Therefore, this essay is to study in the important elements-facts of causing influences to actor's vocalization in course of designing-drawing the performance place and I have come to retracing purposes of the original object in today's constructing the performance place for conveying performer's sound uniformally and obviously.",손정우,2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45030293
영화연기를 위한 배우훈련방법연구 - 신체훈련을 중심으로 -,"This paper is about a study on an actor training method for film acting. Because the characteristics of film as a medium must be very complex, actors should keep elaborate calculation and strategies on acting. However, the method acting technique which has been centered heavily on the film acting world has forbidden acting is utilized by a kind of calculation and strategy while actors do their acting. Therefore, I will try to suggest an actor training method that the physical access through external actions brings about internal emotions. It will be an alternative and a solution for film actors to overcome the limitations above-mentioned. This method for the physical access on film acting will be essential because film must be a visually intense medium, also numerous technical rules in this way can be performed properly with securing the internal truth.",김현희 ( Kim Hyun Hee ),2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A102900014
"웹으로의 이동과 확장, 최근 학원물 드라마의 경향","Web content leads the flow of huge changes through the process of production and transformation in the interaction of the web and traditional media. Amid this trend, the school contents drama is now moving from television to the Web and is facing another. The drama, which was based on a growth drama, has become a variety of genres on the web, including romance, fantasy, comedy, mystery and mystery. There are ways that have been tried in TV school contents dramas but have not been able to occupy a central position through the Web. The expansion into romance, mystery and mystery genres that have been attempted in TV school contents dramas since 2013 is one of the changes in school contents dramas. The emergence of new genres and fantasy dramas that were rare in traditional school contents dramas is another thing to pay attention to.
Small attempts, which are not noticeable on TV, move to the Web and settle down with a distinct personality. Countless school contents dramas broadcast on the Web are transforming old customs. First, the educational materials in web dramas focus on the main characters, namely teenagers. In TV school contents dramas, if teachers and parents often consult or lead to solve problems, most web dramas take the same approach as teenagers themselves or with friends. In web dramas, teenagers do not expect or rely on adults. The role of adults in school contents web dramas has been reduced. Second, web dramas aimed at teenagers have more play, entertainment and entertainment than educational functions or meanings. In a web drama on school contents materials, teenage characters' worries are not spread in a heavy and serious way, but rather in a cheerful and pleasant way. Web dramas tend to focus more on wild and vivid imagination than on the detailed structure of causal relationships or securing probability. Third, TV school contents dramas focused on providing opportunities for appreciation to the inmates. In web dramas, however, inmates do not just observe and appreciate various opportunities for participation are available. This is done through active flaws with game media such as RPG games and women-oriented love simulation games.
The migration of the school contents drama to the Web goes beyond the limits of television, creating products that cater to the tastes of the inmates and showing their colors clearly. Web dramas on school contents materials set up stories, characters, and story space for teenagers to focus on their daily lives. They also use ways in which inmates can become absorbed and actively participate, just like sending a part of their daily lives in web dramas. This is expected to be applied in a variety of ways in the future.",문선영,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105963639
