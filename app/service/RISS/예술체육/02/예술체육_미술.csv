Its strengths include the ease of searching based on Google, the ease of self global marketing, relatively low barriers to entry, and ad revenue guarantees for creators. YouTube's strength in viewership is the variety of free content. The reason why YouTube places the highest ranking in Korea is that users can watch videos made in anywhere on earth for free of charge. The development and popularization of IT technology have affected the growth of the platform on YouTube. Photo and image editing applications have became popular, and the importance of video contents, due to mobile technology increased, has resulted in prosumer and influencer. The residential space design trend has also changed. Since the popularization of color TVs in the 20th century, personal living-rooms designed mostly TV centered living-rooms until about 20 years ago. However, nowadays, designing living room without TV or home-cafe style living-room are currently popular. It is directly or indirectly related to accelerate mobile-friendly environment. Morever, the channel type setting category in the YouTube platform is assigned to 15 categories. After analyzing over 200 popular channels, actual YouTube content creators are subdivided into more diverse categories to run channels differently. The main categories of detail are classified into 43 user-friendly categories by the author. She has classified popular channels and collect cases to derive channel success factors. As a result, YouTube video-content can be successful if creator could apply the success factors. After analyzing the growth rules of YouTube channel, the following four factors were derived. First, creative content planning, second, concise and well-edited content editing, third, continuous operation management, and fourth, to build trust with viewers through communication. These characteristics of the YouTube platform are creating new occupation areas like YouTube creators, content uploaders or content businesses.",변현진,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105937043
금동반가사유상의 제작 방법 연구,"Gilt-bronze Buddhist sculptures are first cast in bronze and then coated with a thin film of gold. They have been produced since the first century A.D. across all areas of Asia, including the countries of Central Asia and Southeast Asia, India, China, Korea, and Japan, where Buddhism flourished. One can, therefore, better understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of these Buddhist sculptures when their materials and production methods are carefully analyzed through employing scientific methods and identifying the stylistic conventions with the naked eye. The gilt-bronze pensive bodhisattva, also an example of a gilt-bronze Buddhist sculpture, was also produced by means of the conventional method, yet it required a more complex and elaborate method due to its unique posture. Two pensive bodhisattva images, respectively designated as National Treasures no. 78 and 83, are the finest examples of gilt-bronze Buddhist sculptures in Korea. They have been examined with nondestructive XRF, γ-ray imaging, and 3-D scanning, and revealed the specific production method, identifying their primary features.
Two primary methods of bronze casting were used in ancient times: “piece-mold casting,” which originated in China and was used mainly in East Asia; and the “lost-wax casting,” which was developed in the Anatolian Plateau, Turkey, or in the Middle East, and spread across regions in North Africa, Europe, and Asia.
National Treasures no. 78 and no. 83 were cast with the lost-wax casting method using core pins. However, the two demonstrate distinction in terms of the method of making the core, covering wax, and carving the surface.
For National Treasure no. 78, a separate clay core was made for the head and body, and each was covered with a layer of wax, roughly carved to give the statue its basic form. The head and body were then joined into a single assemblage. Wax was additionally applied where necessary and details were carved to complete the wax mold. Two metal cores that have been hammered through the shell of the head and body indicate that they were separately made, and molten bronze permeated into the crevice of the neck created a rough protrusion on the inner neck. The use of a thin wax reduced the volume of the body of the drapery folds and ornamentation, thereby yielding an overall flat impression.
For National Treasure no. 83, a clay core was formed in a single assemblage for the head and body. The core was covered with a thick wax layer, which was carved away little by little to complete the wax mold. A single metal core extends from the head to the body. The bronze shell of the statue is fairly thick and the drapery and ornamentation are voluminous.
Extremely fine clay was used to construct the core for National Treasure no. 78, and thus the air trapped inside the wax was not effectively released when the molten bronze was poured in. This consequently resulted in a thin bronze shell, low liquidity of the molten bronze, and ultimately a number of cast defects. These flaws were remedied through an advanced technique that involved re-casting the flawed parts and attaching them to the body, or by pouring additional molten bronze to the defected area. Accordingly, National Treasure no. 78 appears to be impeccable on the surface. On the other hand, National Treasure no. 83 eliminated, from the beginning, the factors that could have led to cast defects, including securing a consistent thickness in its wax model so that the molten bronze could be poured in easily and using coarse clay for the core that allows for the efficient release of air. Although bronze alloy with less than five percent tin content was used for both statues, National Treasure no. 83 may thus be considered superior in terms of casting technique, given the efficient elimination of trapped air, the enhanced flow of molten metal, and the judicious placement of the core pins to securely stabilize the clay core.",민병찬,2016,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A101896536

The body and perception are developed most actively, then, creativity and sociality are cultivated. Therefor, early childhood facilities need a space environment that an early child can support their development as they spend a lot of time there. This study compares and analyzes the spatial characteristics of early childhood education facilities according to the early childhood education theory and proposes spatial characteristics to be considered in early childhood education facilities. These are the research methods. First, through literature research, three meaningful theories that understand the background and purpose of early childhood education theory and influenced 21st century talent development-Montesori, Waldorf, and Reggio Emilia- are selected. Second, central keywords was derived by analyzing the spatial characteristics of the selected three early childhood education theories. Third, the characteristics of the early childhood education space were summarized by analyzing the cases of early childhood education facilities centering on the derived keywords. As a result, the three early childhood education theories had differences in purpose and spatial characteristics, but they had the following common characteristics. There is an open and continuous spatial characteristic that supports free movement by considering the choice and freedom of early childhood’s development. Early childhood develop their sociability by interacting with children of their age. Therefore, a thread is placed around a large space serving as the center. It develops imagination and creativity by exhibiting children’s creations on architectural elements such as walls, ceilings, and windows. It supports children to experience nature and promotes the physical development of children by constructing a slope. Natural light creates a variety of spatial atmospheres, and soft wood is used for floors and furniture that the child’s body touches. It supports various spatial experiences such as changes in the size and height of various windows and floor height.

발달에 적합한 어린이집 놀이터 공간 환경에 대한 연구,"Regarding the standards of the playgrounds in South Korea (centralized in their rides due to its limited outdoor space), there has been a need for a study on the developmentally appropriate space environment for a day care center playground in the country. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to suggest a playground space environment suitable for infants and children's development by deducing and analyzing the appropriate space elements of existing playgrounds. 196 day care centers with minimum of 50 children and nine playground-type day care centers in Seoul were surveyed as the subjects. Theories related to playground environment were studied and developmentally appropriate spatial elements of playground were derived from domestic and foreign day care centers. And those spatial elements were suggested through case studies according to the types of playgrounds, and the analysis on the survey of installation status from the 196 day care centers. In this study, utilization of the nearby public playgrounds as substitutes of their own private outdoor playgrounds was found to the highest among the surveyed day care centers and the use of alternative playgrounds installed and operating on the rooftop or inside the daycare centers was also very common. According to the analysis on the derived primary factors, it was found that all playground spaces, apart from only two centers, were not distinguished in consideration of the developing infants and children, but they consisted of only physically and functionally focused playgrounds, appearing to lack a little or much in the variety of spatial configurations that would attract children's interest. In addition, when considering the proximity factor, only the indoor playgrounds situated in the center of the hallway appeared to have spatial connectivity and the rest showed that the space could not integrate as the expansion of the classrooms. In terms of the diversity, sensory colors were widely considered, but the lack of variety in the material selection of the floor in the classrooms did not satisfy the developmental needs.",최영식,2018,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105152433
루이스 부르주아의 작품에 나타난 신체의 이미지,"One of the central issues in Louise Bourgeois’s art is the body. This paper approaches this issue from multiple perspectives. Bourgeois’s Portrait, for example, in its glistening viscosity and shapelessness, evokes the fluidity of the body’s internal matrix instead of its external appearance. The mucus and diffuse corporeality visualizes the concept of “the formless” and the “base materialism” of George Bataille on the one hand, and the “abject” of Julia Kristeva on the other. Works such as Fillette and the Janus series embody the “part object,” the fragmented body as a target of the aggressive death drive in unconscious psychic life, while it disrupts the categorical difference between the sexes. It is differentiated from the “partial figure” of the modern sculpture, which distills the body into pure form. The obsessive repetition of the bisexual body in Avenza and Cumul is an important characteristic of the “part object.” Furthermore, it reminds us of the schizoid system of “desiring production” of the “body without organs” outlined by Deleuze and Guattari. In She Fox, Bourgeois visualizes the body of the mother as a hybrid of fox and woman. It represents the mother as a strong and powerful woman who disrupts the patriarchal authority. The body images in Bourgeois’s art are expressions of the destructive energy at the presymbolic and presexual psychic level. Bourgeois combines them with the feministic strategy and attempts to disrupt the phallocentrism in modern art and in the symbolic system as a whole.",윤희경,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106258420
메타버스 기반 가상박물관의 사례 분석을 통한 교육적 활용 방안 연구 : 국립중앙박물관 어린이박물관을 중심으로,"As social distancing was implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19. many activities were moved online. Accordingly, various technologies were used to effectively connect people, and the metaverse drew attention, which is a fusion of the real world and the virtual world. As non-face-to-face activities gradually expanded in museums, interest and demand for virtual museums using the metaverse as an environment that could replace the physical space expanded, and various attempts were made to utilize the metaverse.
The virtual museum has evolved with the development of the Web and is currently facing a new environment called Web 3.0. On the other hand, the metaverse is evaluated to have the conditions to implement the technical characteristics of Web 3.0. In addition, the metaverse can provide new experiences to learners by overcoming the limitations of monotonous interaction and adding interesting. This confirms the potential of the metaverse as the future of the virtual museum.
Therefore, this study attempted to reveal the educational characteristics of the metaverse based on the Web 3.0 as a new environment for the virtual museum to move forward. In addition, the prpose was to confirm the process and phenomenon of the development and operation of the metaverse-based virtual museum through the analysis of a case and to propose methods of educational use as a result of the analysis.
For this purpose, the case of ‘Untact Children’s Museum Virtual Exhibition’ of the Children’s Museum of the National Museum of Korea, was used. For an educational use centered analysis, the case was examined based on the educational characteristics of the metaverse-based virtual museum that are related to the characteristics of constructivist teaching and learning.
The educational utilization plan of the metaverse-based virtual museum derived as a result is as follows.
First, by using digital archives to faithfully reproduce elements of reality on the metaverse, or depict realistic virtual elements to enhance the completeness of the space, and by creating a situation that takes place through the s pace in detail, it enhances the learner’s sense of reality and induces immersion.
Second, by using elements such as avatars and NPCs or by constructing a dynamic space, interaction is induced and a cooperative learning environment is provided.
Third, through individualization, learning contents that learners may need and be interested in and activities appropriate to them are supported.
This study is meaningful in that it examines the relationship between the metaverse and virtual museums, which was not revealed in previous studies, from the perspective of constructivist teaching and learning, and suggests ways to use them through educational characteristics and case analysis of the metaverse-based virtual museums as an educational environment suitable for the post-COVID-19 era. It is expected that the metaverse-based virtual museum can be used in various educations from a more expansive perspective in the direction of narrowing the physical distance between the museum and the learner and effectively supporting offline learning.","홍성현(Hong, Seonghyeon)",2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108527019

"영화 <양철북>의 주인공, 오스카의 시선","The Tin Drum is based on G. Grass`s highly acclaimed novel which used magic realism to capture the madness of war, and the folly of the people who made it possible. This movie only tackles the first two sections of the novel, leaving out the post-war events. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign film in 1980, and the Palm d`Or at Cannes. It was also banned in Oklahoma as child pornography. Despite moments of brilliance, The Tin Drum left me feeling incomplete and curiously unmoved. It is a very different kind of film using satire and surrealism to explore people`s reactions during the period from 1939 to 1945. It seems to be saying that it is all right to stop growing (that is, participating in the world) as a protest against the cynicism and corruption of the adult world. The setting for the majority of the film, Danzig (now Gdansk) is a major northern port town in Poland. Danzig was a free and independent city until September 1, 1939, when it became the first region taken by Germany at the outset of WWII. After the war, Danzig became a part of Poland again.The Tin Drum is the story of Oskar Matzerath, a boy who grows up in Eastern Germany before and during World War II. Oskar decides the only way to protest being part of the adult world is by banging on his drum and remaining a child forever. This is his rebuttal of society and his tin drum is his protest against the mentality of his family and neighborhood, or perhaps against all passive people in Nazi Germany at that time. Oskar tries to shock the world out of its inhumanity. His life reflects Germany`s struggle to free itself from its own dream of Teutonic superiority and find peace in the national soul. David Bennent as Oskar gives an outstanding performance, creating a character that is both haunting and frightening. He looks like a little man in a child`s body but his eyes are deep and have a very knowing look that seemed to be looking right through me. Oskar is not a cute little updated version of Peter Pan. Since age three (when he was given his first tin drum), Oskar can scream with such a high pitch that he can shatter any piece of glass. He even controls his scream to the point where he can break windows on the other side of the city, or etch writing into glass. Oskar uses his ability to manipulate and control the adult world, often using vicious and cynical snide comments about the insanity around him. At one point, he disrupts a Nazi rally by changing the beat of his tin drum to the Blue Danube which the band then follows. The ensuing scene where the crowd breaks into a dance and the rain comes down leaving the Nazi soldiers bewildered is one of the best in the film. The film became morally ambiguous for me when Oskar and his troupe decide to entertain the Nazi soldiers at the front lines. Schlondorff never really makes it clear what his motivations are and Oskar`s actions seems to contradict his essentially anarchist protest for most of the film. The Tin Drum also contains some objectionable scenes of childhood sexuality and grotesque depictions of slithering eels being caught using a severed horse head as bait. The result, needless to say, is stomach churning.",조창현(Chang Hyn Cho),2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108251239
