가상 인플루언서의 매력적인 외관 디자인 특성,"Within the realm of social media, influencers' activities play a crucial role in shaping brand images and consumer purchasing decisions. As a result, identifying and engaging with suitable influencers has become essential for optimizing interactions with consumers. A novel type of influencers has emerged in recent years: virtual influencers, who are computer-generated entities. Despite their intangible nature and inability to engage in direct face-to-face interactions with consumers, virtual influencers have garnered substantial support from numerous followers. This study examines the concept of virtual influencers, which have surfaced in conjunction with advancements in modern graphic technology. The research analyzes the physical appearance of more appealing virtual influencers from the existing examples and identifies the characteristics that contribute to their attractive physical appeal. Applying these characteristics, human and non-human virtual influencers were developed using 3D computer graphics software. The physical attractiveness of the created virtual influencers was evaluated, and their appearance design was revised to ensure the proper incorporation of the derived characteristics. Ultimately, the study aims to present the characteristics of an appealing physical appearance that resonates with the majority of the public. The attractive physical appearance of virtual influencers varied by type. Both human and non-human virtual influencers were deemed attractive under certain real-world beauty standards. However, there were differences in attractiveness depending on the degree of virtuality. This research holds significance by offering insights into the attractive physical appearance of virtual influencers, an area that has not been extensively studied before. It is expected to provide a foundational guideline applicable by practitioners and researchers in the virtual influencer industry during virtual influencer creation and research in the future.",박지홍,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639676
패션 기반 통합디자인을 위한 페르소나 개념,"The concept of persona is an essential part of a user-research technique in the field of integrated design, which includes product, visual, and fashion designs, based on the principles of design thinking methodology. However, in the research of fashion-based integrated design, the concept of persona is not limited to user-research techniques, and it is used in various phases of the fashion industry process. Nevertheless, theoretical research on the conceptual characteristics of persona in integrated design remains insufficient. Therefore, this study aims to formulate differentiated persona concepts in fashion-based integrated design by classifying the characteristics of persona concepts used in the fashion industry process. As a research method, the concept of UX design persona, which is predominantly used in integrated design, was examined through literature review. The characteristics of persona concepts used in the fashion industry process were analyzed to identify the discriminatory features of fashion persona, extensively used at various stages of the fashion industry process. As a result, this study identified the following features of fashion persona that could be applied in the field of fashion-based integrated design. Firstly, in the design planning stage, the persona concept can be used as a user-research technique, similar to the UX persona technique. Secondly, it can be used as an extended tool concept to personify the brand or express the identity of designers and consumers as a marketing strategy. This concept can be used in combination with those of existing fashion muses and ambassadors as a tool for consumer communication, however its use will require specific theoretical definitions. In conclusion, the persona concept in the field of fashion-based integrated design, is not limited to user researches at the design stage but can be expanded to various phases of the fashion industry process as a strategy for promotion and communication which can represent user identity. The establishment of persona concepts for fashion-based integrated design will contribute to developing the diversity of methodologies and laying the related theoretical foundation in the field of integrated design, which is expected to expand rapidly with technological development.",신승원,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108639678
상업공간에 적용되는 해학적 디자인의 표현 특성에 관한 연구,"(Background and Purpose)This study aims to define the
characteristics of fun design, which can be the one of main aspects
of converting rational design to emotional design thinking. In
particular, through analyzing commercial spaces to which fun
design is applied, this study proposes to provide foundational data
for the methods of design development that can help designers
establish effective design concepts and lead users to the space
with emotional motivation. (Method)The study focuses its analysis
on food and beverage spaces among the commercial spaces to
which fun design is applied using the analysis method of case study
and literature review. However, this study is limited to cases since
the year 2000, when emotional design started to be actively
applied. (Result)This study has verified that fun design can be an
approach that can arouse positive emotions about a place in
customers and induce them to visit it constantly. The level of the
conceptual application of fun design may differ based on the types
of space, but this study has found that fun design is one of the
conditions to be considered in developing the design of commercial
spaces in such a way that they stimulate emotion.",이진영,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99536228
