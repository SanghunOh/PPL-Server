알렉산더 테크닉의 교육적 의의와 적용에 관한 연구,"Dance is the art form in which human movement becomes the medium for sensing, understanding, and communicating ideas, feelings, and experiences within the structure of time and space. The Alexander Technique is a body awareness methodology that teaches people to move with a greater degree of ease and coordination. This study introduces the basic concepts of the Alexander Technique, its role in teaching dance students, and the current status of Alexander Technique classes in dance schools in the United States. The Alexander Technique helps students develop their kinesthetic sense which allows them to consciously observe the movement of their body while they are dancing. Students learn to dance more freely and prevent injuries by managing their habits and eliminating unnecessary tension. The Alexander technique allows dancers and dance students to find their own original poise, innate resilient mobility, coordination and dexterity. In addition, it relieves psychological tension by releasing tension of the body and teaches dancers to be more focused in the present moment. To effectively teach the Alexander Technique to a dance student, a one-on-one class or small group in a quiet setting is required whereas dance teachers give attention to a group of dancers, keep the class moving and maintain an appropriate energy level. Another difference in the Alexander Technique class is that teachers communicate with students in indirect ways such as acquiring goals through inhibition, non-doing and subtle hands-on work. Currently, the Alexander Technique is widely taught in many dance and performing art schools in the U.S. such as Julliard and the Boston Conservatory. Students exposed to the Alexander technique in dance class enhance their dance skill as well as personal well-being. Therefore, teaching the Alexander Technique to dance students will provide new opportunities for them to learn how to use their body consciously and help them to dance with appropriate dynamic balance.",김성은 ( Seong Eun Kim ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60175214
인공지능과 예술의 융합 양상에 관한 탐색적 고찰,"Many people believed that Artificial Intelligence lacked the ability to 'imagine and think'. However, in recent years, the development of Artificial Intelligence has disrupted Moravec's Paradox, and the challenge, scope and achievement of artificial intelligence robots in arts is dramatic. We analyze the stage of aesthetic art and the direction of future development of the arts by Artificial Intelligence. The results of this study are as follows. First, In the field of visual art, we have advanced from painter robots that imitate, reproduce, and abstract certain techniques to craft robots that make pottery, and Artificial Intelligence of works evaluation features has emerged. And in performing arts, Artificial Intelligence arts is growing rapidly in the music genre, and composing or playing robots are mainstream. The dance genre is a collaborative stage in which dancers and Humanoid robots controlled by humans co-perform together. But in theater, opera, and Pansori, Android robots with human shapes and intimacy have replaced Humanoid robots. In the field of literature and film, Artificial Intelligence with reasoning function was in the stage of producing short works. Furthermore, arts market competition with Artificial Intelligence artists and human artists has been realized. Second, the current level of Artificial Intelligence robot art is analyzed as 'imitation' and 'reproduction'. Third, if strong AI is developed in the future, it is impossible to exclude the possibility and realization of a robot artist's philosophical thinking. Lastly, the dance genre needs new challenges and R&D in the future because so-callef AI art phenomenon is less than other performing arts genres.",태혜신,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106641370

한국 춤과 춤장단의 관계 연구,"Korean folk dances are originated from religious rituals. They have metaphysical and spiritual relationships. Especially, in primitive societies, dances were an only way to have direct communication between human beings and supernatural absolute beings. This implies that out of their necessity, men created gods rather than gods created humans. Their awe and fear, and their pride and elitism that they are selected and privileged by god were developed into religious worship and celebration. The religious devotion and ecstasy (which can be called sinmyeong in Korean) are expressed by dances. People are devoted to religious rituals in their uncious unconscious states beyond human consciousness, and as a result, from time to time they go through religious ecstasy and enthusiasm, experiencing new arenas. The ecstasy helps them to recognize observers and their surroundings and transfer the state to others; so new spaces are created.
Sinmyeong is based not on rational thinking, but on fullness that fear, pain and anger are sublimed into. It can be obtained through our body. It can be expressed in the form of devotion and indulgion indulgence, transcendence, and freedom, ecstasy and joy, at the same time. In this state, people have mutual reactions with objects, nature and others: ideality and reality can be organically integrated in the ecstatic condition. Serious competition, jealousy, hatred, tiredness and worries are dissolved, but only religious devotion remains in the state. People are connected heart to heart by sinmyeong, which is not fragmental but substantial tolerance and compassion. In this state, negative emotions are dissolved and forgiven. Namely, sinmyeong is the main force to enlarge and deepen metaphysical Korean dances. Hence, sinmyeong is based on emotional rhythms to help people to go through sentimental and sensuous experiences rather than physical and philosophical implications.
Jandan in our lives are joyful inspiration that can be obtained through our experiences in our dairy lives. Since they are improvisatory, they are not complicated but simple. They are not mechanical neither repeated. They are expressed in the form of dances adjusting rhythms freely. In addition, the Korean dances are curve-shaped but in hesitating and natural postures, not in powerful, upright and man-made positions. The Korean rhythms do not create time-frames in a logical and rational way, but embody aesthetic and artistic space-frames through dances. The Jangdans are actualized as in-born dispositions of Korean people across the Korean history.
Handangogi, a book about Korean mythology, depicts that the Korean dances are integrated to rhythms. It is characteristics of Korean dances that dances do not lie without any rhythms. In this light, It is natural to look at the relationship between dances and music. This is the Korean dancers' tasks. In addition, it is true that dances and music have been specialized and subdivided true to trends in societies. At this time, dancers should seize Korean rhythms appropriately and adequately in order to fully understand Korean dances. For this, in this study, I would like to examine the tune of gutgeori, a representative Korean rhythm, and the origin and transformation of the salpul-i tune which is a variation of the gutgeori tune. In addition, this study aims to look into what extents the tunes have affected Korean dances.",정혜진,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A100126322
"""12주간의 발레 운동프로그램이 여성노인의 CES-D, SFT 및 NK세포 활성도에 미치는 영향""","The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of a ballet exercise program on depression scale(CES-D), elderly fitness(SFT), and natural killer(NK) cell activity in elderly women.

발레 무용수들의 자세 균형성과 발레상해 경험에 관한 실증연구,"This study was conducted for the purpose of empirically verifying the hypothesis that posture balance has an important influence as a causal factor for injury experienced by ballet dancers. Survey data on 550 classical ballet dancers working in Korea were collected and analyzed with empirical models such as logit and Tobit regression model, which can control the potetial bias caused by spurious causal relationships or censored sample problem. As a result of the analysis, dancers who think they achieved posture balance were 17.5% less likely to experience serious lower extremity and waist injuries than dancers who did not achieve posture balance, and had 1.37 less body parts or 1.17 body parts in lower extremity and waist areas experiencing injuries. The posture balance of dancers was found to be a critical determinant that may determine the number of injured parts by about 30%. This study is meaningful in that it collected empirical data through a large-scale survey, controlled the influence of other covariates, tried to solve analytical problems caused by sample censoring, and logically justified the need to develop an injury prevention program for dancers.",장소정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108117669
컨템포러리 댄스 속 놀이적 특성 연구,"This article examines the realization of play inherent in contemporary dance by exploring Alexander Ekman’s <PLAY>. Through this, it reflects on the intersection between play and contemporary dance.
To analyze the work, it approaches it based on sociological theories of play led by Johan Huizinga and Roger Caillois. In order to emphasize play, it approaches the analysis by comparing and describing play that opposes everyday life. Play is criticized for its uselessness in economic terms. However, the uselessness of play paradoxically contains positive energies such as freedom, boldness, joy, and liberation.
Furthermore, it traces the playful aspects in dance through the four classifications of play proposed by Roger Caillois: Agon, Mimicry, Alea, and Ilinx. In addition, it grasps the principles of play through a dichotomous contrast between everyday life and play in the analysis of <PLAY>.
Play is characterized by various colors and free-spirited movements, creating a sense of liberation amid confusion. On the other hand, everyday life expresses the self confined within an environment oppressed by labor. Here, everyday life is represented by a rigid frame of connected squares, while play generates an organic flow within the circular structure.
By manifesting the desire to return to play through the final moment of undressing, it indicates the importance of play. As seen in the work, play is not merely reduced to an act of recreation; it encompasses various possibilities. Creative ideas arise during the process of play and in the rest after play, serving as the beginning of cultural creation. Above all, it highlights the need for play in order to approach life with a flexible attitude.",전영진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60070475

빅테이터(Big Data) 융합예술의 세계적 양상과 전망분석,"Big Data is the first emerging core technology described in the World Economic Forum among the top 10 technologies. Internet of Things (loT), Robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, new materials, 5G mobile communication, big data analysis, gene editing, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR) are the results of big data. These big data results are very useful in the field of society as a whole and art. However, there are not many cases of studying big data convergence art as creative art. Therefore, this study aims to provide basic data on big data convergence art and predict the future through research on the global development of big data convergence art. To this end, literature research was conducted using Internet data such as degree papers, academic journals and newspaper articles, websites, and blogs. The results of the study are as follows. The Internet of Things Art (IoT Art) area was hardly found in Korea as a starting stage. However, some Internet of Things artwork based on disruptive technology was being produced. On the other hand, AI creative art based on big data algorithms for each art area was developing innovatively and rapidly at home and abroad. Currently, AI works in the field of visual art and music are not distinguished from human works, and they surpass humans in that many works are created in an instant. In terms of big data, the visual field needs to build labeled image big data that can further develop the qualitative performance of AI creation, and the music field is very important to set optimal parameters. In the field of literature, AI is expanding its scope from phrase and sentence generation to scenarios, poems, and novels. They are creating their own new literary works by using existing literary works as big data. Of course, it is difficult to say that AI is engaged in independent creative activities rather than visual and music, but the era has already come when it takes on some of the roles of production and writer of completed works. In terms of big data, there is a high possibility that more interesting works will be created by expanding the size of the data. The dance field has developed from the dancing robot stage to the choreography AI stage. The robot's dance movements are more natural, delicate, and dynamically similar to humans than in the early stages. AI choreography is in its early stages and currently shows various motion samples, but AI auxiliary choreography activities are predicted through performance development in the future.

무형문화재 ‘전통무용’의 개념과 범주에 대한 재고찰,"The purpose of this study is to provide base for the new designation of intangible cultural properties in the field of dance by establishing the concept and category of traditional dance. In order to achieve this purpose, we approached it from two aspects. First, the changes in the Korean Cultural Heritage Protection Act and the UNESCO Convention for Safeguiding of Intangible Cultural Heritage were examined, and through this, the concept of traditional Korean dance was established as follows. Korean traditional dance is a dance created and recreated in a national and cultural community called Korea (ROK), and can be said to be a Korean national dance. In particular, the traditional dance as intangible cultural properties is the dance that has been passed down in a historical lineage from the Joseon Dynasty to the present, and has excellent form and style, which means the dance that is highly likely to be used artistic, academic, and popularly. Second, the category of traditional dance as an intangible heritage was considered by collecting and analyzing the opinions of dance experts using facilitation (collection and synthesis of opinions through group participation discussion), in-depth interviews, and FGI (Focused Group Interview). The results are as follows: (1) Numerical mitigation is needed, such as adjusting the recognition of the transmission period of traditional dance from 100 years to 70 years. (2) Various creative dances based on traditional dances, such as new dances (Sinmuyong), Korean creative dances (Hanguk changjakchum), and new traditional dances (Sin-jeontongchum) that have occurred since modern times, could be considered as traditional dances. In conclusion, the new designation of intangible cultural properties in the dance field requires a proper understanding of the Cultural Heritage Protection Act, and the dance community's agreement on the concept and category of traditional dance, which is the criteria for selecting intangible cultural properties.",김선정,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107374968
살풀이춤의 기법에 관한 연구,"In this paper, I have tried to find the essence of the Salpuri Dance. I have looked in particular at Lee Mae Bang's interpretation of this dance to see how it reflects traditional Korean culture.
The Salpuri Dance has been performed since the beginning of Korean history and has played a leading role Korean artistic expression and life This dance must continue to be performed to keep alive the spirit of Korean arts.
The Salpuri Dance originated in an ancient belief : that good spirits come and take part in it and at the same time evil spirits are driven away. Tjerebu. tje damce wards off or prevents events of ill omen and protects the community from any possible harm with the help of this spirit.
There are three Salpuri Dance in present-day Korea. The first one is the interpretation of Sin Bang Cho, the other two were created by Lee Mae Bang and Kim Suk Ja respectively. All these women are Living National Treasures in Korea.
To look at these dances as works of art, they have the unique aesthetic qualities of ancient Korea which have since developed and refined during many centuries of tradition. Even a certain sexuality was evoked in a chaste, dignified way through the stately movements of these beautiful dancers.
Not every movement has a symbolic meaning. The Dancer's intention must be seen in looking at her performance in its totality.
The highest aim of the dance is to achieve a harmony of dance and emotion, which reaches its crescendo in the pulsating rapid rhythm of the final movement of this dance.
To achieve this harmony before this final crescendo, the dancer must be calm because every movement comes from her spirit. Characteristics of the Salpuri Dance are as follows ;
'O. Dancing with a regular and irregular rhythm at the same time imagining the feeling of the soft touch of JukSam, A free flowing Korean robe.
'O. The breath and muscles stop and start quickly, regularly and irregularly. The change in the dance step and the movement of the wrist is very important.
The arms are extended and folded, raised and dropped, shaken to the right and left.
On the whole, the movement of this dance looks like a straight line, but it actually is a gentle but firm curving motion. The Salpuri Dance is to evoke in Koreans the following aspects of their culture : its sinuosity should remind them of the curves traditional Korean roofs ; the stops and starts of the dance recalls the hard everyday life of the people.
Korean especially appreciate the common people suddenly joining in the dance, the young professional dancers making stately movements, and the dancers wearing the traditional Korean skirt with its folds.
The Salpuri Dance is highly valued in Korea today, because, since it is most typically Korean, it can represent Korean culture best to the world.
The Salpuri Dance must be studied scientifically and properly handed down and not danced with thoughtless changes.
I hope that this study of the technique of Lee Mae Bang's Salpuri Dance will be a help to men and women who love Korean dance and want to pass this Korean tradition to their descendants.",이노연,1992,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107973095

춤곡으로 구성된 J.S.바흐의 모음곡 연구,"Music, in its rhythm, is one of the most essential factors in dancing performance. It controls the performance on the whole - leading dancers, changing or keeping moods, etc.. J.S.Bach(1685-1750)'s ""Suites"" fit to any kinds of dancing performances. They consist of various kinds of dance music with clear rhythms and also contain the aristocratic quality of what Baroque era has. So it is very useful for dancers to know and study about his ""Suites"" for their dancing composition. The purpose of this study is analysis of J.S.Bach's ""Suites"". The answers about following questions are neatly charted. 1. What musical instruments are used for? 2. What are the musical styles of each movements? 3. What are the musical forms and details, for example, tempo, meter, etc... After the analysis, it is determined that Bach’s works has a lot of musical suites like the keyboard, lute, violin, violin with clavier, violoncello, flute and the orchestra. Some of these are bound up by volume such as the English Suite, French Suite, Partita, Violin Partita, Cello Suite and the Orchestral Suite. The Suites are made up essentially of four often interrelated dances in the same key: 'Allemande', 'Courante', 'Sarabande', and 'Gigue'. To this scheme an opening prelude and one or more optional dances were often added. Each movement has their intrinsic tempo and meter except 'Prelude' which is not a movement for dance. 'Allemande' has a common tempo in duple meter, 'Courante' has a little fast in triple meter, 'Sarabande' is very slow in triple, 'Gigue' is very fast in compound meter. 'Prelude' shows the greatest diversity in tempo and meter. Most of movements follow the 'binary form' and 'composite ternary form'. In conclusion, Bach's Suites are very effective at creating dance. The outcome of this study may be used as a reference to select music to dancers.",김은수,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60247312

메타버스 기술을 적용한 무용의 라이브니스 특성,"The current dance creates a new art in the metaverse environment. In particular, dance using metaverse technology is appearing in various ways to realize a sense of presence and presence based on realistic technology. Although these technologies are in their infancy, they are the key to experiencing a new liveness in the environment of the metaverse. In dance using metaverse technology, the audience crosses the limits of time and space and interacts with the environment of the metaverse to achieve subjective appreciation, participation, and experience. This appears as a changed liveness characteristic by breaking the way the audience has interacted in the form of viewing by coexisting with the actor in space and time.
In this regard, in the case of dance using metaverse technology, this study examines temporal consistency between actors, audiences, and other audiences, spatial agreement between actors, audiences, and other audiences, physical conditions of actors and audiences, emotional experiences of audiences, and By analyzing the interaction and arranging the liveness characteristics shown in it, I tried to diagnose the interactive dance centering on the audience in the metaverse era.
As a result, most of the dances to which metaverse technology is applied coexist in the same time, virtual and real space with performers, audiences, and other audiences. In the metaverse space, actors and recipients exist as physical bodies or virtual bodies, and in particular, the audience becomes immersed through subjective participation based on the technical experience to cross virtual and reality, which is an emotional experience that is connected to the metaverse environment.
The main interaction takes place with the environment of the metaverse through experience. This includes interactions between actors, recipients, and other recipients.
This analysis will diagnose the present of dance in the world expanding into the metaverse and lay the theoretical foundation for future creative work.",백연,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106535631
