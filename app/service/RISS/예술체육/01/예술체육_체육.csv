"스포츠 중심의 스포츠심리학, 멘탈코칭","Introduction: The purpose of this study was to define mental coaching and to identify the application of mental coaching in sport. There are confusions in sport psychological interventions between Psychological skills training and counseling. Psychological skills training enhances the athlete`s performance by controlling their various psychological factors through sport psychological interventions. But psychological skills training focuses on improving performance without considering the athlete`s individual development and self realization. Mental coaching consists of psychological skills training, counseling and mentoring. And mental coaching should enhance performance by psychological skills training, promote personal growth by counseling, and promote the athlete`s self-realization by mentoring. Limitations of Psychological intervention: As an application of sport psychology. counseling and psychological skills training is still valid. However, conflicts of psychological skills training, absence of present methods for sport psychological intervention fruits, prejudice for sport psychological intervention in sports fields, limited access routes for the application of sport psychological intervention for athletes, and separation between the sports psychologist and the coach creates difficulties in the application of sports psychology. Conclusion: Mental coaching, in harmony with psychological skills training, counseling and mentoring becomes more effective via integration between the sports psychologist and coach.",윤영길 ( Young Kil Yun ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108279863

사회 문화적 관점에서의 놀이론,"Three characteristics of play can be stressed: it is a voluntary activity, it is separate from real life, and it is fun. Play is a voluntary activity characterized by minimal rules, spontaneity and fantasy, and is viewed by participants as non-work.
In humans, play is any non-utilitarian activity pursued for its own sake. Meanings for the word 'play' abound and are very broad-ranging. Play is often used to refer to a wide variety of activities engaged in voluntarily, and includes such things as games, sports, creative activities, and make-believe.
One of the most influential books on play is Homo Ludens (Man the Player), in which he examines play as a cultural phenomenon, noting that it is an irrational, voluntary activity, characterized by freedom. To Huizinga, play is a free activity standing quite consciously outside 'ordinary' life as being 'not serious', but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own boundaries of time and space. Huizinga states that the function of play can be derived from the two basic aspects under which we meet it: as a contest for something or as a representation of something. These two functions can unite in such a way that the game 'represents' a contest, or else becomes a contest for the best representation of something.
However, the most important meaning of play is that we recognize a concept which is play does not be separated from human beings ordinary lives. In this sense, play can be essential value in living life.",이정학,2004,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108622736

The results of these studies are as follows; there is around 40-50% less chance of getting colon cancer, 30-40% for breast cancer, and 10-30% for prostate cancer. Even with all these studies it was hard to find Korean studies investigated the relationship between physical activity and cancer.
The prevalence rates of cancer are hugely variable due to the difference of gender, ethics, diet habit and physical activity. So it is needed that studies should be done for each ethical group.
The variation of physical activity is huge and it depends on many various factors: intensity, frequency, duration, and type. For this reason, it is hard to estimate the total physical activity accurately with large population in a long term study.

코로나19가 범죄에 미친 영향 - 112 신고 데이터를 중심으로 -,"This study examined what impact COVID-19 had on crime by using 112 report data. To that end, 112 report data for 42 months from January 2017 to June 2020 were collected. Time series graphs were used stepwise for the analysis in this study. The first step was to examine the overall trend of crime. The second step was to compare the monthly crime trends in the first half of 2017 to 2020. Finally, the third step was to analyze the monthly crime trends using the magnified graphs. Through these three steps, this study investigated how COVID-19 transformed total crime, robbery, theft, and assault.
The results of the study showed that COVID-19 had a weak reduction effect on total crime, a weak increase effect on robbery, and a reduction effect on theft and assault. The weak increase effect on robbery caused by COVID-19 contradicts a U.S. research, which may be due to the difference in circumstances between South Korea and the United States.
Based on the results of this study, several policy suggestions are possible. First, according to criminology theory (opportunity theory), COVID-19 was expected to lead to a lot of crime reduction. But, it was not so. Therefore, government agencies which are responsible for crime prevention, such as the police, need to closely analyze the causes and address them. Second, the impact of COVID-19 on crime varied from crime to crime. Therefore, in order to increase the effectiveness of crime prevention, it is necessary to concentrate the administrative power, such as the police, on those crimes that are increasing (e.g., robbery, domestic violence) in the situation of COVID-19.",임형진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82390693
