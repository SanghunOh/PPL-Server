However, its quality is still in need of improvement, as many educators agree. Based on previous research, this paper discusses strategies for the improvement of inclusive education in Korea. The development and the current status of inclusive education in Germany, which is considered to be of high quality, are included in this discussion.
Lastly, this paper presents the following suggestions:
1) The number of qualified special educators in inclusive schools should be increased.
2) The role of special educators in inclusive education should be redefined.
3) vocational education for students with disabilities should be implemented beyond the strict dichotomy between inclusion and separation.
4) Inclusive education Should be discussed in the context of general education reform.",이주화,2011,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82692386
미술치료가 지적장애아동의 자기표현 및 주의집중력 향상에 미치는 효과,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the effects of the art therapy on self-expression and concentration of the children with mental retardation. The subjects of the study were boys at the age of 12 with mild mental retardation showing strong symptoms of ADHD and autistic features. The program consisted 22 sessions in total, and 16 sessions were conducted as private art therapy once a week for 50 minutes. After 5 weeks, 6 sessions of group art therapy were conducted once a week for 60 minutes. To analyze the result of the study, pre- and post-test were performed using Lowenfeld’s checklist of self-expression and Abbreviated Conners Parent-Teacher Rating Scale (ACRS). Also to measure the attention spans of the children, observations made in every session were recorded and the activity processes were analyzed. The results of this study are as follows: First, the self-expression ability of the children with mental retardation improved. Second, the concentration level of the children with mental retardation improved. Third, there was a positive change in self-expression and concentration in the process and the content of the session. In the early stage, they repeatedly scribbled letters irrelevant to the topic and showed no interest in activities, but gradually changed into a form of voluntarily expressing various art expressions and language expressions. Also, children who were distracted and were hardly seated were able to carry out their assignments without leaving their seat for a fixed period of time. In addition, in group art therapy sessions which were conducted to help maintain attention and adaptation at the school site, they were not only concentrated on their work activity, but also helped other members of the group which showed aspects of interactive behaviors. This study is meaningful in suggesting detailed research materials on the process of art therapy through observation and analysis as single case study on the children with mental retardation carrying diverse problems.",김현영,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A104625581
다문화 교육을 위한 일반교육 교사와 특수교육 교사 간 역량 비교 분석,"The dramatic demographic shift in Korea is more apparent in the schools than anywhere else. But this change in the racial, cultural, and linguistic diversity of the student population is not the problem. The problem lies in the way teachers have responded to that change. Concurrently multicultural education scholars have become persistent in their arguments that teachers should become knowledgeable that about cultural diversity and develop pedagogical skills and attitudes to teach these students.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the teacher’s competence including experience, belief, attitude, knowledge, and self-efficacy on multicultural education. For this purpose, a total of 143 elementary school teachers in the both general and special classes participated in this survey. The survey was composed four sub-categories: experience, attitude, outcome expectancy belief, and efficacy. The major results of this study could be summarized as follows: First, the special teachers had fewer experience on multicultural education than the general teachers. Second, There were no differences in the levels of attitude and efficacy between the two groups. Third, the special teachers showed relatively higher level of outcome expectancy belief than the general teachers. Fourth, the both of special and general teachers showed higher scores in the outcome expectancy belief than self-efficacy. In the final part of this article, discussions and several implications on the multicultural education related with special education were provided.",이정은,2012,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A60002284
특수학급 교사의 교권 침해 경험 실태 및 교권 보호에 대한 인식과 지원방안,"This study was a survey of 90 teachers of special classes in middle and high schools in G metropolitan city to find out the actual condition of infringement of school rights, awareness of protection of school rights, and support plans. As a result, first, most of the teachers had a serious level of infringement of teacher rights, and the subject of infringement was mainly parents. Teachers with less experience were less aware of the master plan for the protection of teachers’ rights. Teachers said that teachers’ opinions were not reflected when establishing an educational policy for infringement of teachers’ rights. In the event of a violation of teacher rights, the full-time teacher referred to a fellow teacher as the subject of resolution, and the fixed-term teacher was the school manager. Second, as a support plan for the protection of teachers’ rights, it is necessary to strengthen a social atmosphere that respects teachers, and that schools and offices of education should support them. In order to prevent infringement of teachers’ rights, it was requested to improve the professionalism of teachers and to establish a department in charge of teaching rights. Lastly, we discussed the promotion of teachers’ rights infringement counseling institutions and the development of linkage programs with front schools.","김소현(Kim, So-Hyun)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107398084
