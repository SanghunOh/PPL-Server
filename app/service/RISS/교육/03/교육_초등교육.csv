AI is suggested to be an innovative technology that will shape the future of education. Special attention is paid to how the future of education can be unveiled in real classrooms that adopt AI and how teachers and students can benefit from it. The participants of this study were three pupils with learning difficulty, a homeroom teacher, two English subject teachers, and two external experts. Data was collected via Q-sort, classroom observations, interviews with the participating students, a diagnostic test, a sentence completion test, student performance, and a research log. The triangulated analysis of the collected data revealed that the students heavily relied on AI in the beginning, then gradually developed their routines with AI use, and finally used it less, which gave them a sense of independence. It is further shown that AI relieved the anxiety of the low-achieving English learners and gave them confidence by providing them with options when faced with difficulties in class.
These findings provide insights for understanding the directions of AI applications in English learning and teaching, leading to support for low-achieving pupils’ learning and policy for basic education guarantee.",이세진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108529044

Researchers and practitioners have started to experiment with a variety of speech technology for pedagogical use. However, little research has explored the benefits and limitations of applying the AI-based language applications to primary school English education settings. In this context, this research investigates students’ use of an artificial intelligence English conversational application with a specific focus on their engagement patterns. It also analyzes teachers’ and students’ perceptions of using the new technology in the classroom. Results suggest that the AI-enabled conversational application has potentials to enhance students’ engagement and extend their speaking time by boosting their curiosity, creating a sense of interacting with a human-like partner, and encouraging an active use of computer vision technology embedded in the application. To fully realize its pedagogical values, its limitations need to be addressed by improving the app features, tailoring its functionality to the students’ proficiency levels, and carefully integrating the application within the overall structure of the lesson.","김성우(Kim, Sungwoo)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107074299

For this, a questionnaire was administered to 48 elementary school teachers. For open items of the questionnaire, frequency analysis was performed and for closed ones, qualitative analysis was carried out. The results of the study were as follows: First, most of the teachers considered that they had an average or high level of confidence in their knowledge and use of digital textbooks. Second, about half of the teachers were positive about the readiness of their schools and students to use digital textbooks, but the majority of teachers did not believe that their students would engage in self-directed learning at home. Thirdly, about three-fifths of the teachers reported that digital textbooks were being used in their schools and more than half of them started using digital textbooks after the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. Finally, many teachers said that digital textbooks should contain interesting and useful contents that are differentiated beyond the CD-ROM titles and e-books, and an easy-to-use online platform linked to digital textbooks to manage learning and interact with students.

초등영어학습 부진 양상 및 기초 문자 언어 지도 방안 탐색을 위한 실행연구,"This action research aimed to investigate the challenges faced by underachieving English learners in elementary schools and to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of phonics in English reading instructions. The study provides case studies of two fifth-grade students who struggled with English learning and had low motivation. Data collection was conducted through 24 instructional sessions involving teaching phonics and sight words. Data from semi-structured interviews and classroom observations were collected inductively based on grounded theory. The findings showed that students faced difficulties in identifying alphabet letters and understanding phonics. These challenges led to a negative perception of learning English, further intensifying their learning difficulties. However, improvements in either the cognitive or affective aspects of learning led to a complementary relationship. This paper concludes by summarizing the two cases and asserting the need for early diagnosis of fundamental reading skills and individualized intensive guidance to teach underachieving students. In addition, continuous observation of the learning process and increasing students' interest and confidence to lower the affective filter are needed. This paper emphasizes the importance of teaching and learning strategies, as well as the roles of teachers and other surrounding environments of students in preventing the proliferation of underachievers in elementary English classes.",김도영(Do-Young Kim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108638910

We propose that the followings are pivotal functions of educational chatbots: voice recognition accuracy, providing feedback, employing meaning negotiation strategies, interests, and Learning Management System. An AI-based chatbot, EBS PengTalk, was employed and the features were analysed. In addition, two surveys were conducted with a student group and a teacher group. The results show that EBS PengTalk has weaknesses in those five functions although voice recognition was reported rather satisfactory. It turned out that students were discouraged to talk to PengTalk because responses and feedbacks from PengTalk were prefabricated and limited with several demotivating features. It also turned out that PengTalk is inadequate to initiate self-directed learning. Thus, in developing educational chatbots, careful consideration should be given to users, teachers and students, not only chatbot features.","정고은(Jeong, Go Eun)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107965683

The researcher has developed an AI chatbot and implemented a speaking performance test using it for 3rd graders in an elementary school in Seoul. The results first show that a specific function of the AI chatbot which can track students utterances during the speaking test must be a strong point in process-oriented assessment. It provides teachers with very useful information about students speaking processes as well as performances, which could further be used to help improve students’ English proficiency. Second, the results of a survey indicate that students are generally fond of interacting with AI chatbots and that their interests in chatbots may motivate willingness to speak in English. However, the results also show some limitations of using AI chatbots in classroom. Despite the breakthrough in AI technology, AI chatbots still have technical problems that may severely harm feasibility of using chatbots in process-oriented assessment, e.g. low accuracy rate of voice recognition. There is also an issue of validity and reliability of the AI chatbot-based speaking test that should be endorsed by future research. It is expected that AI chatbots should be cautiously applied in process-oriented assessment towards making full use of the state-of-the-art AI technology.","최원경(Choi, Wonkyung)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106620865

영어 초분절음의 발음지도,"The acquisition of good pronunciation is presumably one of the most challenging aspects to Korean students of English There could be many reasons for this, including the fact that there are dramatic differences of the sound systems between the two languages and that most Koreans start learning English well over the critical period Another important and often overlooked reason, however, is the lack of theoretical backgrounds in teaching English pronunciation per se In spite of its importance, teaching pronunciation has been merely a part of teaching English, if not totally ignored The goal of this paper is to show the need for an application of theoretical, 1 e, phonetic and phonological concepts to the leaching of English pronunciation
English pronunciation is composed of segments and suprasegments Included in segments are consonants and vowels, which are represented in the orthography Suprasegments, which include stress and intonation, among others, on the other hand, can not be orthographically represented The most significant difference between English and Korean sound systems lies in the relative importance of suprasegments In English suprasegments contribute more to intelligibility than do segments, whereas in Korean the opposite is true Given the fact that intelligibility is the single most important goal in teaching pronunciation, the importance of suprasegmental aspects in English pronunciation cannot be too emphasized to Korean learners of English However, in classroom situations, such as English conversation, listening comprehension as well as pronunciation, suprasegments are often buried in tight curriculums or relatively ignored This paper attempts to unearth suprasegments from their unreasonable grave and to highlight their importance Theoretical concepts are applied to such suprasegmental aspects as syllable, stress, sentence stress, linking, and intonation",윤여범,1999,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30052945

Corpora data was compiled of 20 elementary school English textbooks (5 different textbooks from 3rd to 6th grade), wherein sentences were tagged based on classification of its communication function presented in the national curriculum. Then, the continuity of communicative functions was measured and verified by WordSmith Tools 6.0 and the Development Criteria in Language Form (Yu Myung-hee, 2001). Findings show that sub-functions of asking questions, answering, stating and reporting, confirming and explaining are the most frequent functions. The 42 sub-functions out of 121 total sub-functions including these four high frequency sub-functions obtain continuity across different textbooks of incrementing grades. The continuity of investigated sub-functions helps learners be exposed repeatedly to the sub-functional expressions and thus excel the process of storing learning content as long-term memory. Another positive finding is that the investigated sub-functions are in general sequence maintaining an appropriate level of enhanced complexity and expanded expressions.
