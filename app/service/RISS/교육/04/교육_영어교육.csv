
조기 영어교육의 실태와 바람직한 방향,"This paper aims to find out the current state of early English education in the world(including Korea) and to suggest its more desirable direction, with special reference to TEFL in elementary school of Korea.
In fact English teaching in elementary schools of Korea has been put into practice as an extracurricular activity since 1982. But in 1995 the Ministry of Education proclaimed a policy to establish a TEFL program as the regular course in elementary schools of Korea since 1997.
In this connection, the writer surveyed several kinds of theories about early English education to verify the necessity and validity of Korea's elementary school English education. The logical result from these theories is that younger children are better equipped to learn foreign languages with efficiency than older children or adults. However, as most studies are based on logical inferences rather than on direct observation or experimental evidence, we are not sure that those theories are right.
In this view, the writer put stress on the preparation of educational environments to establish a more desirable direction of early English education in Korea, since Korea's elementary school English education will be practiced under EFL environment, not ESL environment. The writer also pointed out some problems of educational finances, the curriculum development process and its content, teaching materials(textbooks and tapes), English teachers, teaching methods evaluation, educational facilities.
This paper concludes that we have to try to solve these problems to succeed in a TEFL program in elementary schools of Korea and suggests several things for a more desirable direction of Korea's elementary school English education.",김해겸,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19562480
내용중심 영어 교수 학습의 도구로서 ChatGPT의 활용 가능성 탐색,"This study investigates the feasibility of using chatbots as a content-based English learning and teaching tool. To this end, researchers asked 27 education experts to complete structured questionnaires about three chatbots: Cleverbot, Kuki, and ChatGPT. Based on their responses, the researchers concluded that ChatGPT demonstrates relatively superior performance in information provision and language proficiency but received a low rating for social skills and moral discernment. While existing chatbots such as Cleverbot and Kuki are programmed to hold everyday conversations, ChatGPT was developed with a deep learning method using a huge language model which empowered ChatGPT to provide a variety of information and have excellent multilingual abilities. Thus, ChatGPT can be used very effectively for content-based English learning and teaching through problem-solving activities, by utilizing its ability to provide information and to create learning and teaching materials. In addition, ChatGPT is expected to be used as a self-directed learning tool for learners and as a teaching aid for teachers in the future.",신동광,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108487001
인공지능 적용에 관한 교실 기반 연구: 초등영어 학습 부진아의 기계번역기 사용과 인식을 중심으로,"This study aims to explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support struggling young learners and provide insights for applying AI to teaching and learning English in the primary classroom. AI is suggested to be an innovative technology that will shape the future of education. Special attention is paid to how the future of education can be unveiled in real classrooms that adopt AI and how teachers and students can benefit from it. The participants of this study were three pupils with learning difficulty, a homeroom teacher, two English subject teachers, and two external experts. Data was collected via Q-sort, classroom observations, interviews with the participating students, a diagnostic test, a sentence completion test, student performance, and a research log. The triangulated analysis of the collected data revealed that the students heavily relied on AI in the beginning, then gradually developed their routines with AI use, and finally used it less, which gave them a sense of independence. It is further shown that AI relieved the anxiety of the low-achieving English learners and gave them confidence by providing them with options when faced with difficulties in class.
These findings provide insights for understanding the directions of AI applications in English learning and teaching, leading to support for low-achieving pupils’ learning and policy for basic education guarantee.",이세진,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108529044
영어 관계대명사 That 연구,"Relative pronoun that is one of the important relative pronouns but we have an impression that its scope of use has been somewhat narrowed. In the light of history of relative pronouns relative pronoun that has the longest history of all relative pronouns and it was widely used even in Middle English and early Modern English. on the other hand, we can see that the relative use of that has been gradually weakened as the relative pronouns who and which has expanded their scope of use.
It is quite natural that the scope of use of that as a relative pronoun has been narrowed as who is mainly used in referring to person and which is mainly used in referring to things. And we can note that that is used only in restrictive clauses, not in nonrestrictive clauses, for that has a strong characteristics of relative conjunetion in comparing with who and which.
That as a relative pronoun still has its own weight because it can take an antecedent referring to person and thing. In particular, it is general tendency that who is used more frequently than that in the case of referring to person because that originally comes from neuter and gives a psychological feeling that it is not adequate for that to refer to things. In contrast, who has an advantage over that because the former originally refers only to person.",최종욱,2000,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19617265
영어 작문 과정에 활용한 ChatGPT에 대한 한국인 예비영어교사의 인식 탐색,"This study explores Korean pre-service English teachers’ perceptions of using ChatGPT in the English writing process and its impact on their writing competence. Participants composed the first drafts on assigned topics, followed by use of ChatGPT for revisions. They were then asked to reflect on their experience with ChatGPT to aid in the revision process. A thematic analysis of learners’ reflections and surveys was conducted to identify emerging themes. The findings uncovered several key emerging themes that are divided into two categories: positive and negative aspects. Positive aspects were divided into cognitive and affective categories. Participants perceived the feedback on content, organization, language use, and all-inclusive service as cognitively positive. In addition, they perceived its effects to be positive in terms of excitement, time efficiency, confidence boost, and willingness to use. However, the hallucination of ChatGPT, ethical issues such as authorship and overreliance were pointed out as negative aspects. This study demonstrates the potential benefits of integrating ChatGPT as a writing tool in English language learning, particularly for Korean pre-service English teachers.

AI 챗봇을 활용한 영어교육 프로그램이 언어교육 효과에 미치는 영향에 대한 메타분,"This study aimed to analyze the effect size of English education programs using AI chatbots on EFL learners’ language education effectiveness as well as moderator variables affecting program effectiveness. Forty-four dissertations and academic journals published from 2002 to March 2023 were selected as the analysis subjects, and the effect size was calculated using a random effect model due to high heterogeneity among studies. A meta-regression analysis was performed to confirm moderation effects, and publication bias was verified using Egger’s regression test. The effect size of AI education programs was significant, with a moderate effect size (0.428; 95% CI: 0.310-0.546), and major variables affecting language education effectiveness included school level by age and length for a single class. In terms of school level, it showed a higher effect size in the order of college students, high school students, and elementary school students. The most effective length of a single class was found to be 51-60 minutes. The time range of 51-60 minutes is mainly associated with university student learning. From both the school level and the length of a single class perspectives, the effect size related to university students is the largest. This can be attributed to the higher likelihood of university students engaging in self-directed learning compared to younger learners. It is believed that self-directed learning time has contributed significantly to improving learning effectiveness. This study provides useful information for developing and application of AI education programs for EFL learners.",박은정,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108731248

For the study, the researcher designed an English speaking task and implemented an learning-oriented speaking assessment using an AI chatbot for 25 learners in the 6th grade. Subsequently, individual interviews were conducted to analyze the learners' responses to the scaffolding. By analyzing learner responses and transcripts of conversations between learners and chatbots, the researcher categorized the types of scaffolding that AI chatbots can provide during the learning-oriented assessment. As a result, first, the scaffolding can be categorized into three areas: linguistic, cognitive, and affective. Linguistically, the chatbots provided scaffolding for conveying meaning, language forms, and pronunciation aspects. In the cognitive aspect, the scaffolding assisted learners in their thinking processes, while in the affective aspect, it helped regulate frustration. Second, through scaffolding using various strategies, learners demonstrated the ability to self-correct erroneous utterances and gradually complete sentences on their own. In addition, cognitive scaffolding helped learners solve challenging tasks at their current cognitive level, and affective scaffolding contributed to improving confidence in speaking English.

초등영어 학습용 챗봇의 구성과 한계 : AI 펭톡을 중심으로,"The current study aims to investigate advantages and limitations of using AI-based chatbots in English classes. We propose that the followings are pivotal functions of educational chatbots: voice recognition accuracy, providing feedback, employing meaning negotiation strategies, interests, and Learning Management System. An AI-based chatbot, EBS PengTalk, was employed and the features were analysed. In addition, two surveys were conducted with a student group and a teacher group. The results show that EBS PengTalk has weaknesses in those five functions although voice recognition was reported rather satisfactory. It turned out that students were discouraged to talk to PengTalk because responses and feedbacks from PengTalk were prefabricated and limited with several demotivating features. It also turned out that PengTalk is inadequate to initiate self-directed learning. Thus, in developing educational chatbots, careful consideration should be given to users, teachers and students, not only chatbot features.","정고은(Jeong, Go Eun)",2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107965683

초등 영어과 교육과정 성취기준의 변천사,"The purpose of this study was to compare and analyze the achievement standards of the national primary English curriculum from the 7th national English curriculum to 2007, 2009, and 2015 revised English national curriculum in order to provide future directions for the development of the national curriculum. The analysis discusses the additions, revisions, and deletions of achievement standards during the history of the development of the national curriculum. The results of the study were as follows: First, the achievement standards have been changed quantitatively rather than qualitatively. The number of achievement standards were reduced whenever the national curriculum was revised, although the actual contents of learning and teaching does not seem to have been reduced. Second, the achievement standards in the 2015 revised national curriculum relied heavily upon the achievement standards in the previous national curriculum without properly addressing frequently mentioned issues such as ambiguous meanings of some achievement standards, neglect of the affective dimension of English learning, and the lack of intercultural competence. Future directions of the national primary English curriculum were suggested based on the findings of the study.","임수연(Yim, Su Yon)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107173343
AI 챗봇을 활용한 초등영어 과정중심 말하기 평가 : 가능성과 한계,"The present study aims to explore the possibilities and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in elementary schools in the context of process-oriented assessment, which is one of the main features of 2015 revised English curriculum. The researcher has developed an AI chatbot and implemented a speaking performance test using it for 3rd graders in an elementary school in Seoul. The results first show that a specific function of the AI chatbot which can track students utterances during the speaking test must be a strong point in process-oriented assessment. It provides teachers with very useful information about students speaking processes as well as performances, which could further be used to help improve students’ English proficiency. Second, the results of a survey indicate that students are generally fond of interacting with AI chatbots and that their interests in chatbots may motivate willingness to speak in English. However, the results also show some limitations of using AI chatbots in classroom. Despite the breakthrough in AI technology, AI chatbots still have technical problems that may severely harm feasibility of using chatbots in process-oriented assessment, e.g. low accuracy rate of voice recognition. There is also an issue of validity and reliability of the AI chatbot-based speaking test that should be endorsed by future research. It is expected that AI chatbots should be cautiously applied in process-oriented assessment towards making full use of the state-of-the-art AI technology.","최원경(Choi, Wonkyung)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106620865

‘AI 펭톡’과 영어 원어민의 초등학생 영어 발음평가에 관한 비교연구,"This paper compares the A.I. Pengtalk’s and English native speakers’ assessment of Korean-speaking children’s English pronunciation. For this, 60 sixth-graders participated as assessees and four English native speakers as assessors. The students enunciated 10 English sentences, repeating after Pengtalk, and their speech was recorded. Pengtalk assessed the students’ pronunciation in a three-point scale for overall accuracy and a five-point scale for accuracy of four phonological elements. The native English-speaking assessors listened to and rated the students’ recordings using the rubric offered in Pengtalk. The assessment results were analyzed using t-tests and one-way ANOVA. The findings are as follows. First, Pengtalk tended to rate the students’ overall pronunciation accuracy and their accuracy in the four elements, and across students’ English proficiency levels, significantly lower than the native assessors. Second, Pengtalk and the native assessors differed in the accuracy order of the four elements. Third, variations in the accuracy order according to students’ proficiency levels were greater in Pengtalk than among native assessors. Fourth, Pengtalk’s automatic speech recognition sometimes failed to distinguish English fricatives from stops. Fifth, Pengtalk’s overall pronunciation assessment of a sentence sometimes disconformed with its assessment of the four elements. Based on these results, suggestions are made for developing and using AI chatbot programs from the perspective of English pronunciation teaching.",박미애(Miae Park),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108361498

Some scholars advocate the usefulness of corrective feedback while some claim that error correction is ineffective and even harmful. So far, however, research outcomes cannot settle this debate. Based on this debate, this study examines whether there is a difference among diverse types of feedback on the effects of L2 learners' writing improvement. This study found that teacher’s direct feedback was more effective than any other types of feedback on the effect of participants' writing improvement. In particular, teacher's direct feedback helped their improvement on grammar, mechanics, and form. Among the types of peer feedback, self-correction was the most effective. In teacher feedback, form-focused feedback had more effects than content-focused feedback, but no difference with regard to peer feedback. In addition, teacher's content-focused feedback was more effective than peer's content-focused feedback. Overall, in all types of feedback, teacher feedback was more effective than peer feedback. However, direct (form-focused) feedback was the most effective in teacher feedback, and self-correction in peer feedback. The least effective feedback in both teacher and peer feedback was indirect (form-focused) feed back, which is simple underlining of errors.","김양희(Kim, Yanghee)",2010,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82504605
What Korean Students Gain from Studying Abroad: English Proficiency and Cultural Awareness,"This study explores how the experience of studying abroad impacted Korean students in relation to their professed improvement in their English abilities and their awareness about culture. It was based on qualitative inquiry into the lives of twenty-six Korean students who studied abroad. Verbal descriptions of experiences were collected through semi-formal interviews and informal conversations over a period of twenty-seven months, which were taped and transcribed. Data was analyzed inductively and findings emerged. The study findings show that all the students believed that their listening and speaking skills improved, and students who studied abroad longer were able to go well beyond their own expectations in relation to listening and speaking abilities. However, in regard to improvement of reading, and especially writing abilities, only degree seeking students thought these skills improved significantly. In addition, all students reported gaining cultural awareness, especially about differences between Korean culture and the host culture. However, the depth of their cultural awareness did not depend as much on length of their stay in the host culture as the kind of experience the student had.

초등학교 영어 기초학력 지도 프로그램 운영에 대한 현장 교사의 인식과 실태 탐색,"This study explored teachers’ perceptions of the operation of elementary school basic English programs. Basic English programs have been implemented as an important component of the elementary English enhancement policy. This study investigated the teachers’ satisfaction level and the effectiveness of the basic English programs to understand the current situation and evaluate the effectiveness of the policy. The findings showed that teachers mainly utilized the “system for the diagnosis and learning support of basic English ability” when diagnosing students’ English achievement levels. Furthermore, most teachers showed positive perceptions about the level of infrastructure and program operation, but this varied by the size of the region. The effect of basic English programs for improving students’ interest in English and self-directed learning ability was relatively lower in the schools in rural areas than in large cities.
Lastly, the majority of teachers demanded support for more teaching and learning materials and program management. This paper concludes by asserting the need for sophisticated support for basic English education at elementary schools, focusing more carefully on the circumstances of the size of the region.",김성혜(Sung Hye Kim),2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108169261
2015 초등 영어교과서의 의사소통기능 연계성 분석,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the continuity of communicative functions of the auditory data that derived from the 2015 elementary school English textbook. Corpora data was compiled of 20 elementary school English textbooks (5 different textbooks from 3rd to 6th grade), wherein sentences were tagged based on classification of its communication function presented in the national curriculum. Then, the continuity of communicative functions was measured and verified by WordSmith Tools 6.0 and the Development Criteria in Language Form (Yu Myung-hee, 2001). Findings show that sub-functions of asking questions, answering, stating and reporting, confirming and explaining are the most frequent functions. The 42 sub-functions out of 121 total sub-functions including these four high frequency sub-functions obtain continuity across different textbooks of incrementing grades. The continuity of investigated sub-functions helps learners be exposed repeatedly to the sub-functional expressions and thus excel the process of storing learning content as long-term memory. Another positive finding is that the investigated sub-functions are in general sequence maintaining an appropriate level of enhanced complexity and expanded expressions. Implication drawn from this study is that low frequency sub-functions (61.2%) require more attention to appropriate continuity throughout the textbook as well as the high frequency sub-functions (38.8%) in current textbooks.","강하나(Kang, Ha Na)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106620932

Chang (2022), the purpose of this study was to examine the text types of 250 English reading passages in the 2013-2022 College Scholastic Ability Tests (CSAT) based on Biber’s (1989) typology. The computer software Multidimensional Analysis Tagger (MAT, Version 1.3.2) (Nini, 2019) was applied to identify the text type of each passage with its dimension scores. Text types were then compared between the norm-referenced (2013-2017) and criterion-referenced (2018-2022) assessment periods. Results show that the most frequently occurring text type was involved persuasion followed by general narrative exposition, scientific exposition, and learned exposition. In particular, involved persuasion, scientific exposition, and learned exposition together accounted for 64% of the total reading passages. Between the two assessment periods, there was no significant difference in the overall distribution of the text types. However, the proportions of scientific exposition, involved persuasion, and learned exposition increased in the latter period. These results suggest that there was a tendency in the CSAT English reading passages to reflect the text types that students experience at college and measure their preparedness as college students.",장지연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108279884
2015 개정 영어과 교육과정에 대한 중등교사들의인식 비교 분석 연구,"This study conducted a survey and in-depth interviews on the competency-based curriculum for 53 English teachers in secondary schools. English teachers recognized that there has been a change in the classes after the application of the 2015 revised English curriculum. In addition, in order to raise students' competency, they were generally aware of importance of the introduction of competency curriculum in the school field. However, it was suggested that the current evaluation system is limited in evaluating students' competency development and needs to be improved. It was found that it was necessary to develop effective teaching methods to cultivate students' competencies and to provide practical guides to teachers.

Pop Song을 이용한 고등학생의 영어 청취력 향상에 관한 연구,"Due to frequent international exchanges, there has been much emphasis on communication proficiency in foreign language education. However, when we look back upon teaching English in Korea over past year, we find that English teaching has been dominated mainly by Grammar-translation Method, which makes teachers and students pay little attention to listening skill that is regarded as the basis of communication proficiency.
Recently many English teachers have shown their interest in listening skill, so they come to use the textbook record tapes to improve listening skill. But listening training by textbook record tapes seems to make students feel bored.
So the purpose of this study is to suggest an effective way of improving listening skill by means of Pop songs that the students are indulged in. The processes of this study consist of three stages : 1)listening to songs, 2) explanation about structures and vocabularies in songs, 3) filing in blanks while listening.
The subjects in the study are freshmen 88 students in girls' High School. They are grouped into two : One is experimental group and the other control group. Among the subjects, the former have been taught by the lesson plan using pop songs, while the latter by the lesson plan using textbook record tapes. The experiment lasts about 9 months(from March to November,1994)
The data for analyzing the study results have been collected from two kinds of tests : one is listening test and the other comprehensive test.
The hypothesises of this study are as follows : 1) Depending on hearing materials (experimental material vs traditional material), there will be a difference in scores of listening skills between EG(experimental group) and CG(control group), 2) Depending on the interest on pop songs, there will be a difference in scores of hearing skills in CG, #) Depending on hearing material, there will be a difference in scores of overall English skills between EG and CG, 4) Improvement in listening skill will give influence on the overall English scores.
The findings of this study indicate that pop songs are effective to improve students' listening skill, that students' interest in the fearing material is important, and that listening skill is closely related to other skills, especially reading skill.
It can be concluded that English teachers should make efforts to find the suitable listening materials which will help students to improve their listening proficiency effectively.",신상민,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A19562544

영화를 활용한 관습적/관용적 표현의 학습 조건에 관한 연구,"This paper aims to investigate the types of conventional/idiomatic expressions preferred by Korean college students when using movies as learning materials. Five high-intermediate college students were recruited for the study, and the materials used included the animation Sing 2 (Jennings & Lourdelet, 2021) and expressions from YouTube. The participants underwent two tests, starting with instruction on the animation, before being followed with a test containing 30 items from it. In another test, they were presented with the same 30 items from YouTube videos. The results revealed that the YouTube items were significantly easier to memorize and recall compared to those from the animation. The participants provided comments regarding their relatively higher scores from the expressions on YouTube. These comments highlighted three factors: first, the shorter length of expressions in YouTube; second, the simpler syntactical structure of YouTube’s content; and third, the practicality and usefulness of YouTube expressions from a pragmatic (pragmalinguistic and sociopragmatic) perspective. These findings have important pedagogical implications for the EFL classroom. It is recommended to consider the participants’ feedback: 1) prioritize shorter utterances, 2) incorporate grammatical knowledge even when teaching conventional or idiomatic expressions, 3) emphasize treating utterances as cohesive units. The study contributes valuable insights into incorporating movies in language learning.",유도형,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108729665

모바일 기반 숏폼 영상을 활용한 한국어 말하기 과제 연구,"This study developed a model for Korean language speaking tasks using mobile-based short-form videos and applied it in real classrooms to explore the future of Korean language speaking education. To achieve this, the study initially investigated the demand for Korean language speaking tasks among intermediate-level Korean language learners. The results confirmed that learners showed a preference for video and audio recording tasks. Based on these findings, the paper designed a preliminary model for Korean language speaking tasks using short-form video production. After implementing the speaking tasks with 35 intermediate-level Korean language learners, satisfaction surveys and in-depth post-task interviews were conducted. The final model of speaking tasks was refined from the preliminary model into a task-centered framework with three stages: task planning, task performance, and feedback. Incorporating the opinions of the students improved the feedback methods. The teacher provided feedback twice: once during the task performance stage, when stydents were constructing conversations, and again during the task feedback stage while reviewing the created short-form videos. Additionally, evaluations and feedback from peer learners were included. The model of speaking tasks utilizing mobile-based short-form videos presented in this study was conceived as a preliminary model, applied to learners, refined based on survey and interview results, and finalized. Thus, the significance of this research lies in the presentation of an effective model that accurately reflects learners' demands.",성인경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108728778
영어교육에서 AI 활용의 한계는 어디쯤일까?: 자동 지문 생성 및 자동 문항 생성의 활용 가능성,"This study explores the feasibility of using Automated Text Generation (ATG) and Automated Item Generation (AIG) in the field of English education. To this end, 60 pre-service teachers directly tried the two programs and participated in improving the quality of the test item through post-editing. The results suggest the following: First, among the participants who corrected the test items of the participants in this experiment, the pre-service teachers modified their test item 391 times in total. Text correction accounted for 75.19% of the modifications, and option correction accounted for 24.8%. In the program user satisfaction survey, 86% of the ATG program respondents showed a positive attitude. In addition, the fact that none of the respondents selected 'very dissatisfied' suggests that there was a high possibility of using ATG at school. On the other hand, the AIG program respondents demonstrated a relatively low level of satisfaction. Overall, 43% responded positively but 33% of the total respondents took a negative stance. Improvements for both programs collected through open-ended questions were also presented. It is, however, important to note that evaluation of whether or not a post-editing attempt was appropriate was beyond the scope of this study.",신동광,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108247080
