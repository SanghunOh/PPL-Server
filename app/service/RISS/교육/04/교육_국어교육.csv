인지적 도제 이론에 의한 음악과 웹 기반 교수·학습 모형 및 시스템 설계,"The future society requires individuals to be equipped with creativity, aesthetic sensibility and self-directed
learning capabilities for the whole life cycle of their lives. These needs of the future society are reflected in
the 2007 Revised National Music Curriculum, which aims to have students enjoy “music-in-everyday-life.” To develop such skills and achieve goals of music education, a web-based music teaching and learning model was designed with application of the learner-oriented cognitive apprenticeship theory. As suggested in the cognitive apprenticeship theory, the web-based model used the six learning processes of modeling, coaching, scaffolding, articulation, reflection, and exploration. Especially, in the model, when going through the six processes, learners reflect on cognitively through monitoring so that they can enhance their meta-cognitive capabilities.
This web-based teaching and learning model with application of the cognitive apprenticeship theory will
contribute to achieving the goals of music education and satisfying the needs of future society that requires
sensibilities and expressiveness of learners. In addition, it would be helpful to conduct further studies that deal with how to implement the model in music classrooms successfully.",조성기(SungKi Cho),2008,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105297322
피아노 듀엣 문헌 연구 및 교수방법,"The purpose of the study is to examine the pedagogical value of the original piano duets composed for the social music events and education. Moreover, it also aims to suggest the teaching strategies by crucial authors and pedagogues for piano duets. In South Korea, a large number of students learn transcriptions of the piano duets, but the most of them do not have any opportunity to work for original piano duets in their proper levels of the difficulties. Since the beginning of the duet history by W. A. Mozart in 18th century, the piano duet reached its golden age for about 150 years. Studying the original piano duets that included the composers intention and nature is very worthful for students to understand the historical background and musical styles. Therefore, this study will provide not only information for the pedagogical piano duet literature but also teaching tactics with positive pedagogical effects of the piano duets for teachers. According to the report by C. McGraw, there are more than one hundred collections of the original piano duets for elementary and intermediate students. The five collections of them provide pedagogical duet works in more than three levels of the difficulties. In particular,
Masterwork Classics Duets, one of the graded collection of the original piano duets, provides a variety of pedagogical piano duet works by fifty composers from twelve countries in J.

지식기반사회에서의 서울(수도권)-지방간 격차 현황과 지방대학의 역할,"It is well known that the inequality between Seoul and local areas in Korea is one of the serious problems in Korea. This paper purposes to study the role of local universities under the empirical study of inequalities reality between Seoul and the other 15 local provinces by comparing 39 indicators in 8 different sectors; residential population, economic activity level, overall local income level, arts and cultural circumstances, public goods and services, commercial convenience service, professional human resources, knowledge base and activities. In this study, the degree of inequalities in each sector is presented with relative indexes to residential population inequalities. This analysis shows that inequalities between Seoul and local provinces exist seriously especially in three critical sectors, i.e. overall local income level, professional human resources, and knowledge basis and activities. As we think of the importance of the knowledge basis in the regional development in the new millenium, current situation is quite pessimistic for the future of Korea. The policy implication of this study is that policy instruments towards nation-wide balanced development need to be concentrated, first of all, on the expansion of professional and expert human resources in local areas. Without this breakthrough, it is hard to expect for local areas to find out development engines by themselves in the knowledge based society.(Kyungpook National Univ./ Kajwa Middle School)",오영수 ( Young Soo Oh ),2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A99666830

ICT 활용 음악교육 논문 분석 - 석사학위 논문 중심으로(1986～2003)-,"One of the important tasks of education is to help students raise skills for adapting themselves to future society. To make students better cope with social changes while living in information-orientation society requires changes in existing school education. The current national curriculum of education seeks text-oriented preparation and operation of school curriculum, supplier-oriented school systems and demander-oriented educational systems for the purpose of realizing educationally, environmentally well-established, school in the 21st century. The rapid development of ICT(Information & Communication Technology), represented by computer, becomes a driving power that provides and implements new educational environments other than before. Now students are more requested to raise skills for obtaining and internalizing necessary information through ICT utilization. A positive use of ICT in music classes would make it possible for students to experience music. Such use would also promote student-oriented learning, resultantly improving qualities of teaching-learning. Thus the purpose of this study is to help set a right future direction of music education using ICT and solve problems with such education, through reviewing previous theses for masters degree in regard to the utilization of ICT. For the purpose, this researcher first reviewed the definition and particulars of ICT education. Then the researcher considered characteristics of ICT-based music education and surveyed actual patterns of such education which were accommodated with existing music studies. In this relation, masters degree theses about music education, issued between 1986 and February 2003 were reviewed and analyzed here. Those theses, whose purpose was to properly settle the concept of ICT use, were classified into five styles according to their theses and then analytically compared with each other in terms of genre, point of time, school type, educational process and school level. Results of the study can be described as follows. In terms of genre, 30.5% of the theses surveyed here focused on the development and application of MIDI programs, and 22.0% on CAI use which was also related with such development and application. Thus a majority of the surveyed theses were concentrated on MIDI programs development and application. The utilization of WBI began to be studied from late 1990s when the Internet began to be popularized in this nation. When analyzed in accordance with their point of time, some theses of 1980s, surveyed here, studied CAI in order to determine the applicability of computer as a major or supplementary means of learning. There have been a variety of studies about Internet-based WBI education since late 1990s. In terms of University type, colleges and universities located in the national capital region, Korea National University of Education and national universities of education conducted studies regarding ICT use more actively and positively. In regard to educational substance system, 52.1% of the theses surveyed here focused on the method and application of ICT-based education, especially in relation to ways of instructing using ICT and their effectiveness and teaching-learning models using ICT. In terms of school level, finally, those theses reviewed here studied ICT-based education mainly in relation to elementary school.",박유리(YuLee Park),2003,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105297405
