As a result of examining the narratives derived from the three research subjects who were the study participants, 3 central themes, 7 core categories, and 24 subcategories were formed, and various vivid narratives according to each category were dervied. The thoughts on deinstitutionalization viewed by the study participants were thematically categorized as ‘trying to live with the reality of disability’, ‘confusion between institution and deinstitution’, and ‘steps towards deinstitutionalization’. As each of the three study participants supports the disabled in residential facilities or has different experiences living in residential facilities or communities as a disabled person, they have different perspectives and positions on residential facilities and deinstitutionalization. However, they shared the point that both individuals and society need to make efforts to truly deinstitutionalization the disabled to live their independent lives in our society.",이준우,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108532702

지적장애인의 정서 및 사회성 기술에 관한 중재연구 동향 분석,"The purpose of this study was to examine the general characteristics and intervention characteristics of research on emotional and social skills of people with intellectual disabilities and to investigate effective social-emotional skill evaluation and intervention methods of people with intellectual disabilities. A total of 34 studies were selected through the selection and exclusion criteria of review of literature. The selected papers were analyzed with the framework of the basic characteristics(researcher, publication year, published journal, and research participants) and intervention characteristics (research design, intervention period/place/sessions, independent variable, dependent variable, etc.). Every year, 2-6 papers have been published for the past 10 years, but the number is relatively low. The majority of studies were conducted on elementary school students with intellectual disabilities, and only one study was conducted on children with intellectual disabilities. Regarding research design, the pre-post control group design was most frequently performed, and the place of intervention was found to be higher in the special education classrooms and welfare centers rather than inclusive classrooms. A total of 10∼12 sessions were conducted the most, and each session was 45∼50 minutes the most. As an independent variable, programs using physical activities such as horseback riding, dance, gymnastics, and badminton were implemented the most, and as a dependent variable, cooperation, self-assertion, and self-control as sub-component of the Social Skills Ratings System (SSRS) were the most studied. Based on these results, the limitations of this study and suggestions to implement effective social skill interventions were presented.",이희연,2022,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108294837
제인 오스틴의 『오만과 편견』 : 이상화된 여성상과 결혼의 주제,"This study examines Jane Austen’s interest in the woman question. She examined the complex problems of survival for women in a patriarchal society in a thoughtful manner. Austen's concern about woman's nature and role provides a powerful structural and thematic bond for her novel. With commitment to a woman’s point of view, she shows how to remove the barriers between the sexes, advances a concept of love and marriage that fuses passionate and altruistic love. A frequent motif in Jane Austen's works may be understood in this light. In particular, Austen grapples with sexual stereotyping most directly in Pride and Prejudice.
Austen wants to describe an alternative to the dominant submissive model for marriage by bringing men and women together in a companionship based on mutual regard. Elizabeth and Darcy, who want to be valued for what they really are, spurn the artificial and demeaning relationships that society imposes.下he means of bringing Elizabeth’s participation to a successful close is Darcy, the principal stimulus and target of her misanthropy. The novel shows how practical and prudential views of marriage encourage the separation from marriage of both love and sex.
Personal integrity, here, in conflict with the pursuit of economic security is maintained. In the marriage of Charotte and Collins, Austen examines a marriage that is actually a business transaction. Austen is aware of the importance of such marriages to single women in her society, particularly women whose economic circumstances leave them with marriage as the only recourse for survival in which recourses for the single woman’s survival are very few indeed. Throughout the novel, a true love relationship implied a mutual renunciation of power, a mutual esteem, and submission to the other in the confidence of a common desire to give to the other. The key properties are here self-knowledge, knowledge of the other, quality and freedom. What Jane Austen emphasizes in her novel is the importance of equality and mutual understanding in the human love marriage.",최민경 ( Min-kyung Choe ),2002,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106980584

최근 3년간 국내 기초화장품에 사용되고 있는 계면활성제와 방부성분 동향 분석,"Surfactants and preservative ingredients have a dominant effect on the safety of cosmetics. This study investigated the main surfactants and preservative ingredients in Korean fundamental cosmetics sold within the past three years. Oil-in-water (O/W) emulsifiers have been mainly polyethylene glycol (PEG)-free surfactants; however, the main solubilizing agents have remained PEG-based.
