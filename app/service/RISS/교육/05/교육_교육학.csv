부모배경에 따른 교육불평등은 심화되었는가?: OECD 5개 국가의 교육불평등 비교 분석,"There is a deep concern that the socio-economic inequality of parents will be inherited to their children through education.

In this paper, the necessary and sufficient condition is derived to prove statistically whether the educational inequality is increasing. By analyzing the PISA raw data which have measured students’ achievements six times every 3 years between 2000 and 2015, it is shown that parents’ background impacts on their children’s achievement differently according to their nation, and that the educational inequality is not widening world-widely.

챗GPT에(게) 묻다,"This review examines the meaning of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI, and Professor Kim Dae-sik, a brain scientist, exchanged questions and answers on topics such as human relations, love, and happiness, risks facing mankind, God's existence and death. First, we asked ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft's search engine “Newbing” to write a book review on “The Future of Mankind Ask ChatGPT,” and then analyzed the contents and composition of each answer. The book review written by ChatGPT was presented in the form of “Overall Introduction-Book Composition Method and Theme-Limitations and Significance of ChatGPT-General Review,” and the flow of the article was generally smooth, but it was difficult to find the writer’s fresh perspective. Google’s Bard article confirmed that the text generation method of artificial intelligence chatbots focuses on universal summaries and simple and clear explanations rather than individuality and originality. Microsoft’s search engine “Newbing,” based on the GPT-4 model, specifically cited the contents of the book to increase reliability and reveal the source in consideration of the issue of intellectual property infringement.
Looking at the conversation scenes between humans and machines, I thought about the significance of the conversation. In order for “ask-answer” to be a process of generating meaning, curiosity, and curiosity about not only oneself but also others and the world must be placed behind it. In addition, to continue the conversation, a literacy ability to discover meaning is required, and literacy presupposes the ability to read between the lines and grasp contextual knowledge. This eventually requires the imagination to fill the gap and the overall perspective to grasp the relationship between the part and the whole, the part and the part. The process of finding meaning is the ability to think about surplus and outside and grasp the context, and if you say one thing, it is no different from the sense of recognizing heat. The sensibility that knows how to capture nuances belongs to the realm of humanism, which is essential for humans to sense and judge an object or phenomenon.
Therefore, Professor Kim Dae-sik’s conclusion in “Epilogue II” of “The Future of Humanity Ask ChatGPT” has great implications. The eye to distinguish the voices of individuals, which contain nuances subtly different from those that “probabilistic parrots” imitate plausibly, is based on humanities knowledge that cannot be easily filled with the names of efficiency, probability, and practicality. To exist as thinking human beings, we realize again that we must ask ‘why’ rather than ‘what’ and rely on the logic of coincidence and the specific context of life, not on the axis of stochastic thinking. And at the core of it, there is humanity that repeatedly asks and answers with a long-term perspective.",김화선(Hwa-seon Kim),2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108673665

Kohlberg bases his studies on the work of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget and the American philosolpher John Dewey.
Kohlberg takes the relatives as one of his two major apponents. His other oppenents are the authoritarians in moral education. What is most important philosophically about the universality of the moral stages is Kohlber's use of them to refute relativism. His work may be seen as a passonate and sustained attempt to avoid relativism in moral education. He often refers to his theory as methodological non-relativism.
According to his theory, the universal invariants are not taught, but are elicited through normal development. Therefore, the mode of moral learning is platonic : role playing and discussing through the moral dilemmas.

Kohlberg's theory contended that basic mental structure is the result of interaction between certain organismic structuring tendencies and the structure of the outside world, rather then reflecting either one directly.

교양 글쓰기 수업에서 ChatGPT의 활용 가능성과 한계,"This study delves into the possibilities and limitations of employing ChatGPT within the context of general writing education and explores methods for actively integrating ChatGPT into classroom environments. As media coverage highlights the astonishing capabilities of ChatGPT, students’ curiosity about this novel technology intensifies. However, concerns regarding its potential misuse and ethical implications in writing education also escalate.
While some skeptics reject the notion of ChatGPT replicating a human-like “thinking process” in writing, it has proven to exceed expectations with its advanced generation abilities in both form and content, seamlessly covering the entire writing process, from ideation to problem-solving, outlining, and editing.
As a result, maintaining a rigid adherence to traditional writing education methods and outright prohibition of ChatGPT’s usage appear unrealistic.
Instead, there arises a necessity to carefully contemplate how learners and instructors can actively harness the potential of ChatGPT in the classroom setting. This paper thoroughly examines the diverse roles ChatGPT can assume at each stage of the writing process while also identifying its inherent limitations. Moreover, we present a gradual approach to effectively integrating ChatGPT into cultural criticism writing classes.",손달임,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108727730

"생성형 인공지능, 생각하는 존재(homo cogitans) 그리고 리터러시 교육의 향방","This paper emphasizes the need to strengthen literacy education for homo cogitans in the era of Generative AI. Generative AI, based on LLM, possesses functions that are comparable to those of humans and should not be underestimated. In this sense, recent literacy education has attempted to incorporate Generative AI as a tool for literacy development. However, this approach does not align with the direction of AI technology, which aims to achieve capabilities comparable to humans. ChatGPT, as a representative of Generative AI, possesses human-like abilities. Therefore, it cannot be regarded merely as a tool. Recently, there has been an increasing need to consider Generative AI as an autonomous agent capable of producing results comparable to those of humans. If this is true, the relationship between humans and Generative AI should be understood as a relationship between different agents.
If we are interested in the development of Generative AI, it is crucial for humans to maintain their own agency and thinking abilities. Otherwise, humans may become overly reliant on Generative AI in their language-related activities, leading to a decline in their thinking capabilities. Therefore, in the era of Generative AI, literacy education should focus on continuously fostering and developing thinking abilities rather than solely introducing Generative AI. To achieve this, literacy education needs to provide students with more opportunities and experiences in language-related activities.",김종규,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108727732

The cause is discussed in terms of the brain structural changes and further the unuse of literacy using the SOC model proposed by Baltes. The complementary effect of literacy utilization was significant in adults of all age groups in the lower 50% of the literacy level, It was not strong enough to offset the decline in literacy with aging. This suggests that training to improve the level of literacy may be effective in the case of focusing on the lower 50% of the literacy level. The decrease in the level of literacy with aging was only in the lower ninth and for the upper rest, the level of literacy was not related to the age. Most adults experience reduction in the level of literacy skills decreases with aging. It means that it is necessary not only to expand lifelong learning opportunities but also to consider lowered learning ability due to adult literacy reduction.",김경년,2019,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106057421
