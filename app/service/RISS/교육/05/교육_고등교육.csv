Besides, heterosexual dating can be a very important process to discover a real 'I'.
Therefore, it's necessary to develop a program to concretely help college students with correct knowledge on love, ways of heterosexual dating, possible problems in heterosexual dating, and heterosexual relationships.
This study has its purpose in developing a love learning program for dating campus couples in order to improve the expression of love between lovers , mutual respect, and generosity.
This research covers (1) the meaning of love, (2) the types of love, (3) the components of love, (4) heterosexual relationships and love learning, and (5) college students and heterosexual dating. The sessions of the program developed by this research are as follows: the first session of introducing the program and his or her lover, the second session of understanding the meaning of love, the third session of understanding one's type of love, the fourth session of understanding one's love seen by the attachment type, the fifth session of understanding each other's temperament, the sixth session of learning how to talk with one's lover, the seventh session of reflecting on oneself, and finally the eighth session of saying goodbye.",김경순,2001,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A3006900
치료 레크리에이션 프로그램이 정신질환자의 우울과 인간관계에 미치는 영향,"The recent trends in the treatment of psychiatric patients have shown more
interests in the development and the evaluation of psychiatric rehabilitation programs
along with pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, with its ultimate purpose of patients'
going back to the community. It is considered quite meaningful for a psychiatric
nurse to develop and carry out therapeutic recreation programs under the situation
where practical rehabilitation programs are under-developed. This study is to evaluate
the efficiency of systematic and therapeutic recreation programs on psychiatric
patients' depression and human relationship so as to suggest evidences which could
be applied in a clinical situation.
The subjects of this study were 12 psychiatric in patients and day care patients
of J Psychiatric Centre in Kwangju City during the period of August 19, 1996 to
September 7, 1996, for whom 10 therapeutic recreation programs have been applied
three times a week for three weeks, and then their effects on patients depression
and human relationships were reviewed.
The instruments of the study were therapeutic recreation programs developed by
the researcher; depression scale which was standardized of Beck's Depression
Inventory by Han, Hong Moo, et aI.(1986); Relationship Change Scale of Schlein and
Guemey translated by Moon, Seon Mo(1980) and slightly modified by Cheon, Suk
Kyun(1994). A questionaire on therapeutic recreation was distributed in order to
evaluate therapeutic recreation programs.
The data was analysed by Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Tests, and answers of each
question was numbered.
The results of this study were summarized as follows;
1. The scores of depression in posttest were significantly lower than before
receiving programs from a statistical point of view(Z=-2.51O, p= .012).
2. The scores of human relationship in postiest were significantly higher than
before receiving programs from a statistical point of view(Z=-2.118, p= .034).
3. Among those programs developed by the researcher, preference was shown in
the order of sing, motion song and physical activities. In order to provide therapeutic
recreation programs in groups for psychiatric patients, it is thought to be more
effective to apply in a gradual way taken fully into consideration of individual's or
group's psychopathic conditions, needs, recreation experiences purpose and values of
the program etc.
In conclusion, there were positive results in patients' depression and human
relationship by practicing therapeutic recreation programs. Accordingly, therapeutic
recreation programs could be approached on a practical and clinical level in
psychiatric nursing with substantial evidences.",김상숙,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693550
가족간호실무에서 가족치료 적용을 위한 고찰,"This study discusses on comparing between Strategic Family Therapy and
Solution - Focused Family Therapy for applying family therapy to family nursing to
nursing practice. Family nursing focuses on the strength of individual family
members and the family group to promote their mutual support and growth where
possible. Family nursing is considerate of the relationships between or among family
members. Family therapy is any psychotherapeutic endeavor which explicitly focuses
on altering the interactions between or among family members, seeks to improve the
functioning of the family as a unit. the functioning of its subsystem. and the
functioning of individual members of the family. Therefor family nursing is related to
family therapy.
Among various family therapy approaches. Strategic Family Therapy and Solution
- Focused Family Therapy are method-oriented and brief in duration. Brief therapy
has to more with clarity about what needs to be changed rather than time. Both of
them obtained the ideas from Milton Erikson. Erikson’s goal in treatment was change.
He believed in utilizing the resources of his clients and designing a “ strategy for
each specific problems"". Nevertheless. they are distinct.
The differences between these approaches are as followers.: (1) Strategic family
therapists are innovative and they emphasized power techniques and the expertness
of the therapists. In general. they use six techniques reframing. paradox. ordeals
pretend. and positioning. (2) Solution - Focused family therapists assist families in
defining their situations clearly. precisely. and with possibilities. The therapist’s job is
to produce change by helping them. by challenging their world view. by asking them
appropriate questions. and by giving them “ skeleton keys"". that is. universal tasks
that have the power to help families find ways to unlock their potential.",오상은,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693575
화학요법을 받는 백혈병환자의 구강함수용액이 구내염 감소에 미치는 영향,"Patients receiving chemotherapy experience side-effects such as stomatitis,
nausea and vomiting. Stomatitis appears more frequency in the leukemic patients who
have bonemarrow depression than those in other cancer patients.
The patients who have stomatitis feel discomfort with pain whenever eat or
speak. They also may be serious because the stomatitis could lead them to sepsis or
death. So, preventive oral care is strongly required for them.
Since the platelets and WBC level decrease during chemotherapy, leukemic
patients need to use gargling solution instead of toothbrushing. Betadine solution
which is usually used in clinical setting has so strong odor and displeasing taste that
it often causes nausea and vomiting. To the contrary, saline is familiar to the most
people and its odor and taste is not bad, and it would be effective in preventing
stomatitis as well.
In this context, this study was done to test the effectiveness of saline and
betadine solution for leukemic patients, and to suggest which the better gargling
solution is.
The subjects, were 40 leukemic patients hospitalized for chemotherapy at the
Chonnam university hospital in Kwangju city, were randomly assigned to the saline
and betadine solution group according to order of participating study.
Data were gathered from December, 1995 to July, 1996, through checking the
patients' objective oral states by the investigator and self reported subjective oral
comfortness before and 4weeks after gargle.
The study design was Quasi-experimental research.
The study instrument(the objective oral state guide and the subjective oral
perception guide) was developed by Beck(1979), and was modified by the investigator.
The SAS PC+ program was used to analysis the data with X²-test, t-test,
Pearson's correlation and AN OVA.
The results may be summarized as follows:
The first hypothesis that saline users will have higher objective oral state score
than those of betadine solution was supported(t=-2.14, p=.038).
The second hypothesis that Saline users will have higher subjective oral
comfortness score than those of betadine solution was rejected.
The third hypothesis that There will be a positive correlation between objective
oral state and subjective oral comfortness was supported every week after
gargle(Week 1: r=.82, p=.OOOl; Week 2: r=.90, p=.OOOl; Week 3: r=.84, p=.OOOl; Week
4: r=.71, p=.OOO1).
As the result, saline would be more effective gargling solution than betadine
solution for the improvement of oral state in the leukemic patients recieving

"대학생의 낭만적 애착, 사랑 성향과 이성교제시 갈등해결 전략에 관한 연구","The purpose of this study was to find out the best predictors affecting courtship conflict resolution strategy. Adult romantic attachment factors(Avoidance and Anxiety) and three distinctive love attitudes(Eros, Ludus and Mania) were used as predictors. 539 South Korean undergraduate students who have dating experience were surveyed. Correlation analysis showed that Avoidance attachment was negatively associated with Eros and Mania whereas it was positively associated with Ludus. Anxiety attachment was positively associated with Mania and Eros. Both Attachment factors were positively associated with unconstructive conflict resolution strategies such as Negative Conflict Escalation, Negativity and Conflict withdrawal. Eros was positively associated with constructive strategy such as Love and affection, Emotional Expressivity, Validation, Focusing, Communication over time, Editing, Feedback and Leveling whereas Ludus was positively associated with unconstructive conflict resolution strategy. Mania was significantly related with both strategies. Finally, stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that Eros was the strongest predictor of constructive conflict resolution strategy whereas Anxiety and Avoidance attachment were for unconstructive conflict strategy. Eros was consistently related to both constructive and unconstructive conflict resolution strategies, It shows that the individual's capacity of Eros tendency could be the strongest predictor for courtship conflict resolution strategy.

고혈압환자의 역할행위 이행에 대한 조사 연구,"Hypertentsion is the most risky disease among chronic circulatory problems and
the patients' compliances witn sick role behaviors regarding hypertension are
considered with importance.
Therefore, this study was intended to survey the compliances witn sick role
behaviors of hypertensive patient who have gotten treatment from the outpatient
clinic, tertiary hospital and determine what aspects should be regarded to increase
the extent of their complience with sick role behavior.
Data was gathered from June 3rd to 30th-1996, and the subjects were 88
outpatients in Chonnam-University hospital, Kwang-ju, Korea. The questionai were
used to mesure the extent of compliance behavior after testing its validil and
reliability.
The data was analyzed by t-test, ANOVA and Duncan’s test, and the results are
summarised as follows.

1. The score of compliance with sick role behavior was 57.7 over 75 and it is
about level of 76.8%.
2. The varience that has the most significant difference on the complience with
sick role behaviors regarding demosociological characteristics was ’religion’and the
score of complience with sick role behaviors of religious group(58.96) was higher
than the one of non-religeous group(55.63)(t=-2.54, p<.05).
3. The varience that has the most significant difference in the extent of complience with sick role behaviors regarding complicated disease of hypertensive
patients were drinking and smoking group. And in the non-drinking(t=3.73, p<.05)
and non-smoking group(t=4.06, p<.05) has far much higher score of complience with sick role behavior.
4. In considering status of blood pressure, the patients in the third stage
hypertension has highest score of complience with sick role behavior in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure and it is regarded significant statistically.
5. In considering the weight of hypertensive patients the group of 11-20%
overweighed patients showed the highest score(59.16%) on complience with sick role behavior, the group of the 31 % overweighed(58.58%) was the second, the group of the normally weighed(5.79) followed and the last in order was the group of 21-30% overweighed group(t=1.35, p<.5).
6. Followed by eacg items the highest score on compliences with sick role
behavior was ordered by regular hospital visiting(4.97), refraining smoking(4.75),
regular tablet taking(4.65) and the worst score on complience with sick role
behaviors was ordered by snack control(2.85), special diet for weight control(2.85), limited high salt diet(3.16).
As a conclusion the extent of complience with sick role behaviors of
hypertensive patients who have been treated in outpatient clinics in the department of internal medicine, Chunnam University Hospital was much better than the one in other type of medical organization. And the control of food that might cause bad effect on could be significantly related to the complience with sick role behavior.

스트레스-대처 모델의 통합적 접근에 관한 고찰,"The concept of stress has received considerable theoretical and empirical attention
in recent years, yet much confusion and controversy remain. Attempts have been
made to integrate various points of view. While the concept of coping is intimately
tied to that of stress, it has been largely neglected by researchers until rather
recently. There was a growing conviction that all coping processes, including those
traditionally considered undesirable such as defense mechanisms, have both positive
and negative consequences for an individual, and that any evaluation of coping and
adaptation must take into account diverse levels of analysis and the specific nature
of the situation in question.
This study attempted to integrate two theoretical approaches of the stress-coping
model: the cognitive approach and the cognitive phenomenological approach. The
traditional approach was structure-oriented model. It was emphasized structural and
stable aspects such as general coping traits, styles, or dispositions, and focused on
individual differance.
The cognitive phenomenological approach was transactional and process-oriented
model. It was centered on a process approach to the assessment of coping. The
term transaction means that the person and the environment are in dynamic and
mutually reciprocal relationship. Coping is constantly changing cognitive and behavioral

efforts to manage external and/or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or
exceeding the resources of the person(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984a).
Integrated model based on two representative approches to stress-coping process
was implied that personal cognitive characteristics, situational factors, and coping
behaviors have to be considered together. Nursing has a unique opportunity to
develop a scientific base for stress, coping, and related health outcome. Integrated
model was helpful to understand client’s stress and useful for effective and efficient
stress management.",조복희,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693558
새마을運動의 地域社會組織事業的接近,"The achievements the Saemaul movement has made in the past ten years are successful to such a great extent that it is widely recognized both at home and abroad as the chief driving force for modernizing rural communities and national regeneration.
The authors believe that with all its well-known success the Saemaul movement is still in the process of fulfilling its pledged ideals. Therefore, this requires a critical view of the strategies and technologies it has so far adopted in terms of its overall objective of inculcation of an improved work ethic among the Korean people.
As an integrated and joint venture. to improve community situations, the Saemaul movement has to rely on the knowledge and skills emanated from various fields of professions. Modern professional social work, based on scientific knowledge and skill in human relations, concerns itself with organized activities aimed at helping individuals or communities to meet their basic needs, and at promoting their well-being in harmony with the interests of their families and communities. As a science and an art, social work could make a substantial contribution to the Saemaul movement.
The authors have every reason to believe that our Saemaul movement with all its alleged success has somewhat neglected the utilization of professional social workers. Therefore, this paper attempts to identify the major problems the Saemaul movement has faced so far and to present feasible solutions to them by applying the community organization method with the schemes for problem-solving suggested by Robert Perlman and Arnold Gurin utilizing the social planning approach of Jack Rothman.
There is no doubt that social workers, in general, and community organization workers, in particular have expertise in dealing with complex community problems, and can promote the Saemaul movement.",南基旻,1984,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45020149

Parse의 인간되어감 이론,"Parse has developed the human becoming theory that is unique to nursing. Human
becoming is a unitary construct referring to the human being is living health. She
synthesized concepts from Roger’s science of unitary human beings and existential
phenomenological thought.
This articie examined the Parse’s human becoming theory and critiqued by Kim’s
Coherence model. The critique criteria utilized a five level analysis framework for
evaluating theoretical work in nursing of Hesook Suzie Kim.
1. The philosophy of science level : Parse’s human becoming theory, intentionally
structured as a unique human science nursing, accurately reflects the ontology and
epistemology of human science philosophy.
2. The metaparadigm level : Parse’s theory of human becoming deal with the
client domain concept.
3. The Nursing philosophy level : From existential-phenomenological thought, Parse
drew the tenets of intentionality and human subjectivity and the corresponding
concepts of coconstitution, coexistence, and situated freedom. Parse’s theory lays a
foundation for a nursing science that is grounded in the meaning of lived
experiences in the human universe process. The nurse as living unity in true
presence joins persons and families in journey of illuminating meaning, synchronizing
rhythms, and mobilizing transcendence. The goal of nursing is the quality of life from
the person’s perspective.
4. The paradigm level : Parse presents her theory as emerging from the human
science paradigm and she remains congruent with those philosophical underpinnings
throughout her work. The two major paradigms identified in nursing are the totality
paradigm and simultaneity paradigm.
5. The theory level : The theory focuses on the lived experience of unitary human
beings in continuous interrelationship with their worlds. Human becoming theory is
broad in scope and applicable to individuals, families, or communities in change or
crisis. The concepts are highly abstract and theoretical, but they can be observed in
situations nurses encounter daily.
As the purpose of the theoretical structure is to guide nursing practice and
research, its usefulness will be more fully appreticated by practice, education and
research.",이강오,1998,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693576
"스트레스 측정의 방법론적, 기술적 고찰","The purpose of this study is to research and develop a Stress Measurement
Model for disabled persons who face greater challenges to their mental stability due
to limitations placed on their life by various physical handicaps. Prior to this, the
systematic study of stress closely related to mental and physical health was
attempted almost entirely through theoretical and methodological approaches. On the
contrary, this study proposes the reconceptualization of stress, a revaluation of the
factors influencing stress, and the development of a specific method of stress
measu rement.
In order to approach the problem of the reappraisal of the concept of stress
itself, we tried to reconceptualize the idea of permanent stress by elaborating upon a
biochemical model developed by Hans Selye(1936) and Pierre and Henri Loo(1986).
We further considered a socio-psychological concept of stress formed within a
socio-occupational envi ronment.
From the methodological point of view we explored the type of stress which may
be caused by person-environment interactions. We proposed research problems and
developed stress measurement methods Wlich were based on biochemical, psychosocial,
and psychopathological factors. The research problems focused on are as follows :
1. What is the function of stress in human life?
2. What kind of stress is the greatest priority to reduce?
3. In what ways can stress be reduced, not only in daily life, but in occupational
situation?
4. How can we establish a correlation model of stress to properly benefit human
beings' efficiency and vitality?
5. How can we relieve the feeling of powerlessness experienced by so many
human beings?
If the concept of stress, which has become a topic across many fields of both
the social and hard sciences, can be acknowledged as an operational concept, it
would be useful for the promotion of health and for the rehabililitation of our clients.",조복희,1996,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693554
불안과 지연보상 획득의 불확실성이 만족지연에 미치는 영향,"The present study examined the following hypotheses : (1) the higher the level of anxiety, the more likely the delay of immediate gratification will be inhibited, and (2) the effect of anxiety on the delayed gratification will be mediated by the perceived uncertainty of obtaining a delayed reward. One hundred and ninety undergraduates were measured on trait anxiety and asked to make choice among the following alternatives : (1) a less attractive but immediate reward(i.e. applying for a less attractive company for an immediate admission), and (2) a more attractive but delayed reward(i.e. applying for a more attractive company after preparing for 5 or 6 months). The level of the uncertainty of obtaining the delayed reward(high, low) were manipulated by the possibility of getting an admission to the more attractive company. The preference and the perceived uncertainty of obtaining the delayed reward were measured at each uncertainty condition.
As predicted, the results indicated that the subjects with high anxiety were less likely to delayed gratification compared to those with low anxiety. However, the effect of anxiety on the delayed gratification when the perceived uncertainty of obtaining a delayed reward was statistically controlled. The results also showed that when the treatment increased the perceived possibility of obtaining the delayed reward, the subject with high anxiety preferred the delayed reward as much as those with low anxiety.",허승,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A1985544

experimental group, and also at the same time in control group.
The pc-SAS package was used to analyze the data along with Chi-square test,
t-test and regression.
The result of this study were as follows :
1. Religion(x2=4.022, p=0.045), experiences of drinking alcohol(x2=15.286, p=0.000) and
educational experiences of AIDS(x2=14.82. p=0.000) showed significant differences in
homogeneity test between experimental group and control group.
2. In Hypothesis 1. ""The scores of AIDS knowledge in experimental group will be
higher than that of control group."" was supported. After education, the experimental

group showed significant improvement in the scores of AlDS knowledge, but the control
group showed no significant differences(t=9.76, p=0.0001).
3. In Hypothesis 2. ""The scores of AlDS attitude in experimental group will be
higher than that of control group."" was rejected. After education, the experimental group
showed improvement in the scores of AlDS attitude, but showed no significant
differences(t=1.08, p=0.278) with control group.",윤현숙,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693563
회복중인 알코올 중독자의 영성체험에 대한 연구,"This is a qualitative research exploring the recovering alcoholics' spiritual
experience. The data collection of this study was conducted from August, 1994 to
May, 1995. The research participants were nine male persons who were the members
of alcoholics anonymous and were keeping sobriety for more than three years. The
data were analized using phenomenological approach suggested by Van Kaam.
The recovering alcoholics’ spiritual experience fell into four divisions: lived
experience before sobriety, situations of spiritual experience, change of life after
spiritual experience, and synthesis. And it can be concluded:
1. Lived experience before sobriety: experiencing psychological anxiety and social
maladaptation such as inferiority, loneliness and hopelessness, fear and anger, and
self-injury like writing in blood, suicide attempt in the pain by relapse.
2. Situations of spiritual experience: spiritual experience was made through
personal life or effort such as loneliness, desire for human love, self-awareness of
alcoholics, but mostly through the experience of high power by means of good
fellowship or collective effort like the process of message in AA and practice of AA
12 step.
3. Change of life after sobriety: maintaining continuous sobriety life by change of
self-concept, social growth and emotional stability, through taking on a new meaning
for alcohol, depending life on high power, and through life of sharing and service by
means of spiritual experience and practice of AA 12 step.
4. Synthesis: (a) the alcoholics before sobriety experience psychological anxiety and
social maladaptation such as inferiority, loneliness and hopelessness, fear and anger,
and self-injury like writing in blood, suicide attempt in the pain by relapse; (b)
spiritual experience is made through personal life or effort such as loneliness, desire
for human love, self-awareness of alcoholics, but mostly through the experience of
high power by means of good fellowship or collective effort like the process of
message in AA and practice of AA 12 step; (c) they maintain continuous sobriety
life by change of self-concept, social growth and emotional stability, through taking
on a new meaning for alcohol, depending life on high power, and through life of
sharing and service by means of spiritual experience and practice of AA 12 step.",이정숙,1997,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A82693567
