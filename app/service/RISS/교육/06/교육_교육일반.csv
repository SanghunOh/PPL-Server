To this end, cases of writing classes using ChatGPT were analyzed and the survey on learners' perceptions was conducted. In the liberal arts course of A university in Korea, an essay writing activity using ChatGPT was performed after subject-specific reading. A total of 62 learners decided on the guidelines related to the use of ChatGPT through discussion before writing the essay. From an analysis of the results after writing, text citation, prompt input, source verification, and revision were found, and educational implications were derived. In the subsequent survey, more than half of the learners positively recognized ChatGPT as a tool for saving writing time and improving process efficiency. It was also revealed that ChatGPT was most frequently used for idea generation and information gathering. However, learners pointed out problems concerning the quality, source, and credibility of the information. Therefore, education on the reinforcement ability to compare, contrast, judge, and synthesize information from various sources should be strengthened. In addition, clear and specific writing ethics standards and guidelines for the use of ChatGPT must be provided. This study has value as an empirical study using ChatGPT in college liberal arts writing activities.",오선경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636724
윤리적이고 주체적인 글쓰기를 위한 지도 방안 연구－ 글쓰기 윤리 교육의 새로운 패러다임에 관한 모색,"Nowadays the majority of the university in Korea have opened writing classes as a compulsory subject and writing ethics became the essential chapter of it. But still many students made plagiarism with or Without dishonest intentions, and they seem to have difficulties to make innocent sentences when they quoted reference materials It’s because they only have been taught they must keep writing ethics, and nobody explains how to avoid it. So we should teach how to write ethically, as well as how to avoid plagiarism. This thesis give focus on the feasibility of writing ethics.
We can find 3 reasons for students’ doing dishonest behavior on writings, which are unethical intentions, careless writing, and bad manner for information on the internet. Among them, carelessness is the major reason for plagiarism. It means it could be very difficult to practice writing ethically, especially for students who are poor at writing. And we’ve known that Just learning the art of annotation and quotation isn't enough to conduct writing ethics. So the reminding writing ethics and teaching writing skill must run in parallel. In this thesis, we suggest various solutions for 3 cases.
First, unexpressive students with no sense of their theme require reading training and sentences practice together with learning quotation technique. Second, students with poor judgment need an ap propriate information retrieval in company with paraphrasing and summarization of it. Third, group activities are proved effectual for students with passive attitude toward learning, and in this case it is more important to encourage students to feel confident about it.
An incomplete understanding cannot draw to carry it into practice. So the aims to educate for writing ethics must be changed into concrete and empirical. Essence for teaching writing ethics need to shift from technique toward sensibility. We suggest Dignity and Collective Intelligence for new paradigms for instruction of ethical writing. Also it cannot be too useful to make various ethics-educational programs both inside and outside the writing class.",김지연,2017,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A105323397
교육공동체 관점에서 본 교사-학부모 간 협력 과제 : 학부모의 교육관여를 중심으로,"The current study explores ways on how teachers and parents can develop active collaboration based on the discourse of educational community. Analyses on teacher-parent conflicts were conducted in light of four core values of desirable educational community; a) shared visions, b) democratic participation, c) collaboration and communications, and d) relational caring. Parent involvement was suggested as a practical vehicle for transforming current conflicts into sustainable and successful teacher-parent collaboration. Further, the present study examines areas and concepts regarding parent involvement, as well as, theories and prior studies on factors motivating parent involvement. Driven from the analyses, six intervention strategies were developed in order to help Korean parents participate into their children’s school education as independent and subjective members of educational community. Intervention strategies include the following: first, promoting dual and equal communication between teachers and parents; second, increasing school administrators‘ efforts for conflict mediation; third, respecting parental autonomy and uniqueness when participating into their children’s school education; fourth, providing education for teacher trainees on issues and coping strategies when collaborating with parents; fifth, emphasizing the significance of parental involvement activities reflecting core values of educational community; lastly, building partnerships among school(teacher), parents, and local community, which enhances mutual growth by sharing resources.",신혜진,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106972931

‘변혁적 역량기반(Transformative Competencies)’ 미래지향적 교육설계방안,"With the development of information technology, society is changing at rapid pace. Add to this the accelerating movement towards globalization, and it becomes quite difficult for experts, let alone educators, to make predictions about the world’s future. Not surprisingly, the demand for competency-based education is rapidly increasing, for societies are requiring more and more competent people, who are not only capable of adapting to this rapid change, but of improving their societies as they do so. Moreover, competency education is continuously evolving along with these various social changes, and while movements to construct competency education are also being actively promoted and developed in universities, small gaps still exist between the competency education that is currently being constructed, and the competency training that has been recently pursued. In light of this, attempts have been made to provide the theoretical and practical plans needed for educational designs that are based on the ‘transformational competency-based education’ of the OECD; the very plans that recently appeared when educators were designing competency based education for their respective universities. This study looked into the major flow (what does ‘flow’ refer to?) of competency-based education, and analyzed the academic concepts of the transformational competency-based education that is currently progressing in universities. After learning certain theories in regards to transformational competency-based education, this study deduced some educational design elements based on constructivism, and proposed some educational plans that can be applied to actual environments.",설연경,2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A106929870
"지능 자동화 시대, 탈-노동의 의미와 교양교육의 가치","This article discusses about the meaning of post-labor and the value of liberal arts education in the era of intelligent automation, where the value of human labor and knowledge is changing. In particular, it examines the nature of Automatic Society based on digital information technology and the conditions of human life from the perspective of French technology philosophers Simondon and Stiegler. Based on this, the article reveals the importance of liberal arts education as a new life ‘ars’ in the post-labor society that will come with artificial intelligence. Simondon's technical mentality and technical culture reveal a new model of post-labor existence that enables people to organize their work and public activities alongside AI, rather than in competition with it. Stiegler embodies Simondon's outlook by calling for a transformation of the crisis of labor and spirit caused by the algorithmic governmentality of Automatic Society into an opportunity for the invention of new kind of knowledge and work. The era of intelligent automation shifts the paradigm of life from labor productivity and expertise to post-labor and liberal arts. We need to cultivate life ‘ars’ so that the time freed from labor due to automation can be used to take care of our own lives and the lives of others, inherit our cultural traditions, and produce new values. Liberal arts education should move toward fostering digital literacy with a humanistic outlook in order for us to understand the human condition of living in an automated technological environment and to discover the value of the human spirit and the meaning of human life.",김재희,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108731921
지속가능발전교육을 위한 지역사회 문제해결 중심 PBL 수업의 효과성 연구,"This study aims to reveal the effectiveness and significance of PBL classes through the analysis of a PBL class case centered on community problem solving for education for sustainable development. This study utilized a case study of a PBL class in the course “Reading the World Made with Empathy,” which was designed under the theme of the 11th goal of the SDGs, “Sustainable Cities and Communities,” as a tool for analysis. The learning goal of the PBL class is to cultivate ESD core competencies through community problem solving project activities.
The results of the t-test for the evaluation of ESD core competencies showed a significant difference in the mean values of competencies before and after the training, which proved that ESD core competencies improved after the training. There are three aspects of significance in the evaluation of reflection through the analysis of reflection records. First, through team activities of cooperation and feedback, the cognitive capacity of interconnectedness to relate local issues to oneself was expanded. Second, social responsibility and socio-emotional competencies were cultivated through field trips to allow for the students to deeply empathize with local issues and to get a sense of solidarity with the community. Third, the motivation and willpower to cultivate problem-solving skills and practical action capabilities were enhanced by deriving the results of the S-VALLEY project, which solved practical problems for the sustainable development of the region.
Therefore, this community problem solving oriented PBL class is expected to provide meaningful implications for the expansion of ESD in universities and the development of practical education programs in terms of fostering the core competencies pursued by ESD and by encouraging participation and action in community activities.",김미경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636729
"L2 학습에서의 자기평가 효과－메타인지, 자기주도 학습, 자기 성찰 능력을 중심으로","This study aimed to examine the benefits of self-assessment in second language (L2) learning, specifically focusing on metacognition, self-regulated learning, and self-reflection. Sixteen university students from D. University voluntarily participated in the study after completing an online English (L2) presentation course in either 2020 or 2021. The participants' proficiency levels varied from beginner to intermediate.
By conducting in-depth interviews and employing thematic analysis to explore participants' perspectives and experiences, the study uncovered a profound recognition of the significance of self-assessment in relation to metacognitive abilities and personal growth. The findings underscored the transformative impact of self-assessment on L2 presentation skills and metacognition. Assisted by a specifically designed rubric, these effects encompassed a comprehensive understanding of preparation requirements, identification and improvement of strengths and weaknesses, and heightened engagement and progress in the learning process.
Additionally, students highlighted the positive influence of self-assessment on self-regulated learning. They explained that self-assessment served as a motivator for diligent preparation, the timely completion of tasks, improved time management, and persistent efforts to enhance their performance. Moreover, students demonstrated a proactive mindset by taking ownership of their learning, setting goals, monitoring their progress, and adjusting their strategies accordingly.
Lastly, students expressed a keen recognition of the significance of self-assessment, acknowledging its unique potential for objective self-reflection. They recognized that this benefit of self-assessment, followed by teacher feedback, could reach beyond the scope of their presentations and influence various aspects of future disciplines and contexts that would be essential for life-long learning.
These benefits suggest that combining self-assessment with detailed rubrics and precise teacher feedback enhances its value, thus fostering dynamic, learner-centered L2 education.",김경란,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108636726

On the basis of Pinar’s autobiographical methods, I investigated the path that leads one to find his or her authentic self through dreams. In order to garner the full meaning of our dreams, I looked at the possibility of integrating the views of Freud’s psychoanalysis theory, and Jung’s analytical psychology. Following this, I applied it to the case analysis of dreams related to the search for academic identity.

외국인 유학생 교양교육과정 개발 연구,"In this paper, I suggest the guidelines on the curriculum design of the liberal art courses for international students by examining and analyzing the data for the state of international students, the level of Korean skills, and lectures they've taken and completed. The analysis result shows that foreign students and graduates tend to have taken the diverse liberal art courses including Korean culture and history than the courses for the foreign students like learning Korean, and culture and history of their countries. In addition they have completed the courses more than required for graduation.
Based on this result, I point out that the current curriculum consisting of similar and overlapped courses for raising Korean skill, and exclusive courses for international students and lectures in English, does not provide the appropriate education for the international students. Also it is emphasized that the curriculum should be changed and enforced in the direction to reduce a gap between the Korean communication skills they learn in the class and practically required ability, to help them adapting Korean culture, and eventually to have them overcome the difficulties of lives in Korea as foreign students by themselves.

Most related theories and the results agreed with the result in the practical class except two cases.
The first case was the pronunciation of the affricate /ㅈ/ and /ㅊ/. Existing reviews reported that the matter could be solved naturally by the teacher patient enough to invest a long time into the matter, but the practical class showed some learners from a certain area showed little improvement in pronunciation due to their geographical conditions even if they were all Chinese-speaking learners.
The second case was lenition. It seemed quite difficult for the learners to understand lenition through a simple picture. For beginners’ class, it was proved that steady training of lenition throughout the all classes was the most efficient and much more effective than dealing with that as a partial unit in the process of learning Korean.

The participants included 91 students attending C college, located in Gyeonggi-do. 51 students were assigned to a somatic mindfulness meditation course, and 40 students (the control group) were assigned to a humanities course, without any mindfulness and body awareness training involved. The results of mindfulness, body awareness, and ego-resilience upon the two groups were assessed in week 1, and again when the course was over after 14 weeks. Homogeneity using a variance test, the mean, the standard deviation, and a mixed ANOVA were performed using the SPSS 2.0 program.
In parallel with this, a focus group interview was conducted with eight students in order to evaluate their personal experience of the somatic mindfulness meditation course, along with their experience of practicing the course’s techniques at home.
Finally, the study assessed any changes that the students might have felt as a result of taking this course. The students were selected based on their attitude toward the course, their attendance record, and their home practice rate.
The quantitative data results showed that in all mindfulness (F=10.531, p<.01), body awareness (F=19.867, p<.001), and ego-resilience (F=4.349, p<.05), the interaction effects between the groups, and the time of assessment, were statistically significant. Based on the qualitative analysis, the results were classified into four areas: 1) physical, 2) emotional, 3) cognitive, and 4) everyday life, as well as into 15 subcategories. The subcategories included ‘decrease of mind-body discomfort’ in the physical area, ‘being able to maintain some distance from negative emotions’, ‘reduced frustration’ in the emotional area, ‘being aware of differences between thoughts and reality’, ‘becoming generous with myself’ in the cognitive area, and ‘choosing a meditation method for myself’ in the everyday life area.
The findings indicated that the students managed the stress they experienced from their school work and in their personal lives using what they learned from the course. Based on these results, the use of mindfulness as a way of educating self-care for mental health, and as a tool for future character education at the college level, is further discussed.",강화,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107775337

This lesson plan consists of online lessons dealing with current affairs taking place outside the classroom based on flipped learning, as well as PBL-based classroom lessons involving collaborative activities focusing on the solving of a certain issue, and then delivering a presentation regarding the current affair.
Learners experienced the following effects from these lessons: first, by quickly adapting to the changing learning environments and the methods used therein, the students were able to improve their level of learning thanks to new teaching methods.
In this rapidly changing society driven by the arrival of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, quick and sensitive reactions to new learning methods such as ‘blended learning’ will not only satisfy our learners' needs, but hopefully motivate them to continue on with their studies. secondly, these lessons enabled self-directed learning through prior learning called ‘flipped learning’ in their current affair classes. In these sorts of classes it is important to figure out the flow of the situational context (I don’t quite understand the meaning here) in the society across professional and academic fields. By helping our students to do so, we can increase their problem-solving abilities at the main lesson stage in the classroom, and further enhance their level of expertise which will be needed for academic-purpose learning, along with their abilities of learning in their chosen majors; and finally, the present study developed a lesson model and proposed actual lessons at each stage of the flipped learning and PBL processes. This model was based on blended learning as it pertains to combining different learning methods. Moreover, we proposed detailed alternatives to the current Korean teaching and learning curriculum.",임진숙,2021,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107396308

인공지능기술 학습도구와 PBL중심 교양영어 교과목 개발 및 적용,"This study aims to develop and implement a PBL framework using AI technology-based learning tools, namely, Naver Papago, Google Translate, and Grammarly. The six-week framework was embedded into a General English course at a university, and a total of 20 students participated in the study. After collecting 19 students’ questionnaires and 4 sets of group journals in which 20 students participated in four groups, the data were analyzed in order to investigate the students’ English learning experiences through the General English course. The findings are as follows. The students had positive English learning experiences in terms of cognitive factors, affective factors, satisfaction, linguistic factors, knowledge construction, and reflective practices. On the other hand, the students had negative learning experiences in relation to the inadequate quality of AI technology-based tools and the rather over-reliance on the tools. The study concludes with some pedagogical implications: the inclusion of a student-initiated grammar session involving feedback provided by Grammarly, and English language practices involving speaking and writing, both of which should serve to lower the over-reliance of the technology-based tools.",김미경,2023,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108572671
