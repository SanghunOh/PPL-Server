콜버그의 인지적 도덕성 발달이론에 관한 연구,"This paper studied the Kohberg's cognitive moral development theory, I enterpreted the theory as the formalisn which resulted from his refuting relativism. Kohlberg bases his studies on the work of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget and the American philosolpher John Dewey.
Kohlberg takes the relatives as one of his two major apponents. His other oppenents are the authoritarians in moral education. What is most important philosophically about the universality of the moral stages is Kohlber's use of them to refute relativism. His work may be seen as a passonate and sustained attempt to avoid relativism in moral education. He often refers to his theory as methodological non-relativism.
According to his theory, the universal invariants are not taught, but are elicited through normal development. Therefore, the mode of moral learning is platonic : role playing and discussing through the moral dilemmas.
And then l interpreted the theory ass human activism. Kohlberg's theory contended that basic mental structure is the result of interaction between certain organismic structuring tendencies and the structure of the outside world, rather then reflecting either one directly. Therefore it is not guite right to say that the stages are simply drawn out of the child. Rather the human capacities and their tendencies are both realized aud modified by their application to and confrontation with the social and environmental conditions of the times. In this context, l interpreted the Kohlberg's theory as the human activism.",이경원,1995,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108547648
"영아의 기질, 어머니-자녀 간 애착, 비언어적 의사소통 능력 간의 관계","This research takes a comprehensive view of the relationships found among toddler temperament, the degree of mother-child attachment security and toddler nonverbal communication skills in an effort to determine if and how mother-child attachment security serves as mediator between toddlers` temperament and their nonverbal communication skills. Forty mother-child dyads participated in this study. Instruments used were The Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (ECBQ) to measure temperament, The Attachment Behavior Q-set for assessing mother-child attachment security and The Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS) for toddler nonverbal communication skills. Analyses results are as follows. 1) In the toddler temperament relationship to toddler nonverbal communication skills, a negative relation was found between the toddler negative affectivity and nonverbal communication skills and a positive relation was found between extraversion and effortful control; 2) regarding toddler temperament and the degree of the mother-child attachment security, toddler temperament negatively correlated with negative affectivity, positively correlated with effortful control, and did not correlate at all with extraversion; 3) a positive relation was found between the degree of mother-child attachment security and the toddler nonverbal communication skills (Initiating and responding to Joint Attention Behaviors/Initiating and responding to Behavioral Requests/Responding to Social Interaction Behaviors). Thus, 4) the mother-child attachment security served as mediator between temperament and nonverbal communication skills, and it was found that when the attachment to the mother was secure, the nonverbal communication skills of the toddler would also be good even if the toddler had a negative temperament. These results have strong implications for planning and conducting workshops and conferences aimed at assisting parents in developing strong secure attachments which would enable good nonverbal communication skills.",김선영 ( Sun Young Kim ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A30001831

유아의 스마트기기 이용과 발달 수준 및 공감 능력과의 관계 탐색,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations between the start time and frequency of use of smart devices and preschoolers’ developmental level and empathy as well as the differences of developmental level and empathy depending on parents’ media intervention. The participants in this study were 90 mothers of three-to five-year-old children enrolled in a daycare center and a kindergarten in Seoul and Kyung-gi-do. The mothers completed a questionnaire for demographic backgrounds, media usage, and K-CDI (2nd) and the Empathy Questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s α, correlation analyses, multiple regressions, and Mann-Whitney U tests. The findings were as follows. First, preschoolers began to use smart devices from 2-3 years old and used them 1-2 times a week. Second, the start time of the use of smart devices was positively related to preschoolers’ self-help behavior, fine motor skills, language, and over all developmental level. The frequency of use of smart devices was negatively related to preschoolers’ self-behavior and fine motor skills. The relationships between use frequency and empathy and between use frequency and attention to other’s feelings as a subscale of empathy were significantly negative. Third, depending on parents’ intervention in their children’s media use time, there were significant differences in preschoolers’ social development and language understanding development. Depending on parents’ intervention in program use, there were significant differences in social development, language understanding development, and empathy, especially attention to others’ feelings. These findings provided developmental tendency between the use of smart devices and preschoolers’ development and implications for the need for appropriate standards and guidance on the use of smart devices for the preschool period.",성지현 ( Jihyun Sung ),2015,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A45000733

인공지능기술 활용 대화형 영어 학습 앱을 적용한 초등영어 말하기 수업 분석 : 학습자 몰입 및 수업에 대한 학생과 교사의 인식을 중심으로,"Developments in artificial intelligence such as natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) are making it a viable option to incorporate AI-powered language learning applications into the classroom. Researchers and practitioners have started to experiment with a variety of speech technology for pedagogical use. However, little research has explored the benefits and limitations of applying the AI-based language applications to primary school English education settings. In this context, this research investigates students’ use of an artificial intelligence English conversational application with a specific focus on their engagement patterns. It also analyzes teachers’ and students’ perceptions of using the new technology in the classroom. Results suggest that the AI-enabled conversational application has potentials to enhance students’ engagement and extend their speaking time by boosting their curiosity, creating a sense of interacting with a human-like partner, and encouraging an active use of computer vision technology embedded in the application. To fully realize its pedagogical values, its limitations need to be addressed by improving the app features, tailoring its functionality to the students’ proficiency levels, and carefully integrating the application within the overall structure of the lesson.","김성우(Kim, Sungwoo)",2020,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A108271195
"유아의 기질, 상호작용적 또래놀이와 아버지의 양육스트레스, 양육참여 간의 구조적 관계","The purpose of this study specified into following two folds: (1) to examine the structural relationships among a child’s temperament, interactive peer play, father’s parenting stress and his participation in child-care, and (2) to explore whether these structural relationships are influenced by a mother’s employment and the gender of the child. Using data from a survey of 1,525 children from the 4th year of Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey, a structural equation model was devised. Survey data revealed that a child’s temperament exerts a significant positive direct influence on interactive peer play and parenting stress mediates the relationships between a child’s temperament and interactive peer play. However, a father’s participation in child-care does not mediate the relationships between a child’s temperament and interactive peer play. Second, the structural relationships among a child’s temperament, interactive peer play, father’s parenting stress and participation in child-care do not present any differences with regard to mother’s employment and child’s gender. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed in detail.",연은모 ( Mo Yeon Eun ),2014,https://www.riss.kr/link?id=A107964768
